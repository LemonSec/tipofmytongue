[Music]

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
one of the staples in every outdoor

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,560
event of the hacker community

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,119
the infrastructure review

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
all all the numbers all all the facts on

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,720
how much love labor passion

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,719
tears pain

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,840
energy and and so on went into making

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,079
this event even even greater than the

10
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,079
last one and even more

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,320
more awesome than anything i've seen

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,800
before to be honest so please give a

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,399
very very very loud applause to the mcg

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,399
2022 infrastructure team

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,479
many many things for the warmer blouse

16
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,520
it's really helped us to forget the last

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,600
10 days for build up and keeping the

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,240
power running for all you have fun and

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,600
have power

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,880
so i give you a

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,600
review about first first planet we make

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,720
our power monitoring like ccc camp and

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
oh we have some nice dmr stuff we tested

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,680
and then come a lot of things for the

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
not planet

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,439
some stuff not arrived some stuff was

27
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,479
missing some stuff was wrong and yes we

28
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,720
had plenty of things to do

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,560
so

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
first always yeah plants always right so

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
this is one of our plants um

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
maybe this was working then

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,759
the cable is too short uh sync's not

34
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,720
here so we have switched over lines and

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,360
we measure lines uh okay we get some

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,880
wrong

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,799
resistance on it we have to change to

38
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,560
bigger cable just just you happened uh

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
if you're on a field

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
and this is different from last time so

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,479
we had a different setup this time last

42
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,560
time we have more generators mid in the

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
field and we have planet first to use

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
transformers from leander as a local

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
power company

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,840
and they say so oh we have built up

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,440
a cloud computer center we have no

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,520
people to get you your transformer and

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
we switch to use

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,120
generators and we use the scouting

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,160
infrastructure this is built for scouts

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,720
so they normally hook up some i think

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
some cookers maybe a warm water heater

54
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
something like this and then we put on

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
this network our power and put more

56
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,080
cables on it so we have about 150 cable

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,599
linked after the cabinet from the

58
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,640
scouting so we never do this again

59
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,440
so

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
that's not the right idea

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,160
so we had some issue with uh current

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,120
loop uh resistance so the answer they

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,599
could uh cycle builder will not drop

64
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
properly so i do do a lot of things

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,440
about this

66
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,640
so then finally some nice thing like

67
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,680
every time this is rental equipment or

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,319
you see on the right side a swather boat

69
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,519
with an uh speed limiter if it's a ce

70
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,000
block

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
let's just make a picture of it that's

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,599
very nice he's a second

73
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,000
controller inside and you have inside

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,480
you have more speed

75
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,440
even this is rental stuff now other

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,760
stuff is tested from the rental company

77
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,519
say it's all tested you can use it fine

78
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,400
no it's not

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,879
[Applause]

80
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,680
this was also a nice device was we

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,879
collected

82
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,280
there was some pizza oven with some

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
problems with the heating element so get

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,239
some

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
error current to ground and it puts this

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
nice thing in first thing is a 300

87
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,799
milliamp lcd is not allowed

88
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,840
out 32 amps are smaller connectors have

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,599
to be a 30 milliamp lcd so i just put in

90
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,439
a 300 milliamp and

91
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,959
it's very nice

92
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,599
in german called this classic new lungs

93
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,400
so

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,360
the

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,920
main incoming earth ground is about the

96
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,160
right device you see this is some

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,720
protection diode about 50 volt okay as

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
the voltage goes under case from the

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
enclosure goes over 50 volt then this is

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
this short circuit to ground is dose one

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
time

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
and now it's an open circuit

103
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
people if you bring stuff that's working

104
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,520
not properly just give us a call come to

105
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,759
us we will your help we always have some

106
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,360
mecklenburgers who fix our stuff in

107
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
every event that's normal if you have a

108
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
problem we can try to fix it for you

109
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
maybe we can try to get your parts for

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
you we will help you if you have any

111
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
problem with electrical equipment come

112
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
to us we're not so bad guys we will help

113
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,440
you get stuff running and get it safe

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,960
for all for all

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
so don't do it please

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,360
even some we collect some

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
32 to 16 amps adapters and some other

118
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,000
riot stuff we just

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,280
catch them and give them a back

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,160
then also things yes we have very nice

121
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
generators with oh a little bit smoke

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
so this is a state what you get some

123
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,039
rental equipment

124
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,800
so this have to running a little time or

125
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,320
we have plans in the middle you see a

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
nice cabinet from scouting says there's

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,199
some 63 and 32 connectors inside and we

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,800
open it and say

129
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,199
oh nothing inside maybe a sugar

130
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,479
connector

131
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,960
or nice connector so

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,120
insulation is cut

133
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
on the cables or you use a knife at it

134
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,320
please if you have need assistance come

135
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,960
to us we help you if have any problem we

136
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,599
fix it for you

137
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,800
so we go out of stuff we get a second

138
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,199
rental company maybe we get some stuff

139
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,759
more this is very helpful we are running

140
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,000
out on stuff on monday and build up so

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
all was gone

142
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,759
and we get some nice cabinets as you see

143
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,160
on the right with belgian connectors and

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
so oh not all have the smoothie plug

145
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
with a hole inside and we get this nice

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,199
adapters too from my greco

147
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,120
that's weird but it's working you have

148
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,440
to switch over to ce

149
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,039
normally this shook was not allowed why

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,280
you don't have the polarity with neutral

151
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
and lifeline but this one on the belgian

152
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
connector you have says you cannot plug

153
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,199
in a wrong direction and then go back to

154
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,280
shuku and it's working

155
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,160
the middle device that we found and this

156
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,199
was some measurement device under 32 amp

157
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,479
with no extra fuse then open lines and

158
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,440
to shuku people don't do it

159
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,639
this is

160
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,000
where it is don't do this

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,680
buy a fuse box put refuse in that and

162
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,800
no other no guys not this way

163
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,520
isolate tape i don't know is it is

164
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,919
related dc voltage on the outside

165
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
please don't do this

166
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,039
we

167
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,039
our people will got home and very

168
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,680
healthy state and diet people is nobody

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,319
want to have this and even this is a

170
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,960
child we never can accuse it for us for

171
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,440
ourselves

172
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,560
so

173
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,479
we are measurement every every every lcd

174
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,960
on the field we make us on ccc camp and

175
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,199
we make this on congress and we do is

176
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,039
now here and

177
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,720
there was some discussion about this

178
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
have you do it

179
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,960
always be doing it this was a lesson

180
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,280
what you learned you find always broken

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,560
stuff

182
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,199
rcds on the field detested as as

183
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,280
commander on the truck is

184
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,599
treasure judging around the field before

185
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,919
the big plays that something get wrong

186
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,919
we test everything we found broken

187
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,199
devices we replace them and just help

188
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,080
ourselves safe some hackers bring weird

189
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,639
stuff yes we are hacker camp that is

190
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,000
fine so but the lcd have to be working

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
for all we have in the safe state that

192
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,400
is really really important to check this

193
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,280
we do it this time we make it always as

194
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,800
help as people

195
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,520
and this is such a nice thing to do

196
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,919
we found some weird things this is about

197
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,879
that you see on the on left corner this

198
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,440
is a short current that we have the 65

199
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,199
amps on the sugar line

200
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,160
and

201
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,960
the

202
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,280
circuit breaker need a lot a little

203
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,879
little amount of current to trip fast if

204
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,360
the loop indents goes too high

205
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,319
then that the breaker will only uh

206
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
trip on the terminal and just take some

207
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,599
time to pre to trip so maybe have a fire

208
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,080
on it says here you have some mass loop

209
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,320
and long lines thus we have to run

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,599
thicker cables

211
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,080
and we can fix this from this fast and

212
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
the lowest end

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,399
what he can do even on the right rtc we

214
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,760
must earth current earth's resistance on

215
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,800
the generator on the spike this is

216
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,920
okay

217
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,800
but

218
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,320
measurements and stuff will help us out

219
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,600
so then we come here and starting make

220
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
power oh okay go set on the generator

221
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,240
but the general rule does not hook up

222
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,920
okay i go ahead and hook up the

223
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
generator there's a small cable so i see

224
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
on the right

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
and we get some two errors first one say

226
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,320
running overspeed

227
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
okay

228
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,200
so generator runs on 52.8 hertz this is

229
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,399
a lot

230
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,399
this is no problem for the most devices

231
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,800
except the usb from the block team is

232
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,360
now say oh this is not right or let me

233
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,000
switch to battery and then slide

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,519
then this was this little switch what

235
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,279
you see is a

236
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,959
resistance load and the generator

237
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,040
tries to

238
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
regulate this against the resistant load

239
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,760
but you have to hook up external load

240
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
the switch was on nobody knows this but

241
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,000
this was not the biggest issue what you

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,560
have the biggest issue was you have

243
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
masters the generator here on the field

244
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,720
and e0 was not bonded very neutral and

245
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
ground

246
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,000
we start the measurement on the boxes

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
what he delivered out and say hey we

248
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,680
have a lot of of of resistance we cannot

249
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,440
things we had about 10 kilo ohms

250
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,560
resistance

251
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,320
and the incoming network from lyanda

252
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
from the power company is a tt network

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
let's have no bonding as have a bonding

254
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,000
in the transformer but not the local

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
bonding at the power

256
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,200
houses here

257
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
then we talked to our greco and uh they

258
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
say yes you have to open the generator

259
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
we make some trump temporary fix with a

260
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
coffee cup

261
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,760
a little bit water

262
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,279
and since you see we have to bond to

263
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,760
this and the right picture you see the

264
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,680
uh the wires are

265
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,360
there is a green mark just have to hook

266
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,200
to the neutral position this was the

267
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,880
only channel that had it we measure ever

268
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,279
generator lesson learned

269
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,240
measure every stuff don't trust anything

270
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
you don't know somebody can rent this

271
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
before some guys do something on the

272
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,040
generator everything try to measure it

273
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,440
so we have fixes a problem son we have a

274
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
proper grounding and our lcd is stripped

275
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,399
correctly that's what we need

276
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
then we're starting to try get some

277
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
monitoring this first planet same we

278
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
bring our power boxes

279
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
yes some guy heads us in near frankfurt

280
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,040
oh we have a truck you can leave this

281
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,680
and then while the truck on 120 load and

282
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
we don't have them

283
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
so and we had so much to build up

284
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
uh to get the monitoring running like we

285
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
do with on the on the other events so

286
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,839
then we find there's a greco

287
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
have a nice controller on it most uh

288
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,160
commercial big generators have the

289
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,320
deepsea control on it just rebranded

290
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,880
with a greco oh this has a modbus and as

291
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,160
a netport

292
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,800
so eight thousand years controller and

293
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
it's very nice if you register or

294
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
deepsea just make an account here you

295
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,279
can download the software and you get an

296
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,079
300 page modbus documentation with every

297
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,320
command that you need oh we tries on the

298
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,120
first generator oh we have to set up and

299
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,440
then something happens

300
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,980
[Laughter]

301
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,100
[Music]

302
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,350
[Applause]

303
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,639
yes there was a short out on a zero like

304
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,600
here as well a talk running um other

305
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,240
people are very happy about this so oh

306
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,160
power off i love it

307
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
yes this was a different style

308
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,399
controller we don't look exactly on it

309
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,160
and i think as far as the canvas the

310
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
generators talk aggressive with a canvas

311
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,959
cable is it just an xlr cable so and

312
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,200
then we plug an ethernet port in and the

313
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,399
generator says so oh no just don't like

314
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,680
it switched off the then 2 gets all this

315
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,120
load and there is a ooh on the speed and

316
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,440
then just the motor gets

317
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
turned off

318
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,399
so it hasn't handled the load and then

319
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
was a complete power output

320
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,760
broken the generators and the postcards

321
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
is fascinating happy about this they say

322
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,120
so oh that was rude wrong port

323
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,959
really turned me off and they got off

324
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,800
yes you look on the back side you see

325
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,639
this nice computer logo on it that says

326
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639
port a 10 and the day says okay just

327
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,079
plug unplug it plug a network in and

328
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,959
that

329
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,360
was our fault

330
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
then we get our connections

331
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,200
we pick our phone

332
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
uh knock was very helpful then there's

333
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
some confirmation we approach okay we

334
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,519
have uh controller follow-on

335
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,760
some cable issue in the

336
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
e0 building then set up our pizza box uh

337
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,639
getting patched

338
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,000
and yes we get some data

339
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,440
this is the

340
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
from e0 but only one generator the

341
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,760
second one is only modbus so you need an

342
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,800
uh an interface and he's exactly uh

343
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,760
where the machine builder starts cooking

344
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,320
and you see nice in the in the middle of

345
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,920
the day as they see the cooking phase

346
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,199
and it gets a little bit down and then

347
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,279
see when the dishwasher is running

348
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,240
this on this is only the half

349
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,880
load this is another one generator you

350
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
see current c voltage

351
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
and another and another generator was on

352
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,120
the souther field a small one on the

353
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
kemper

354
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,959
this do not lot of work there mostly the

355
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,560
lightnings here

356
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,120
but you gain current you get voltage

357
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
you get your frequency you get the

358
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,639
temperature

359
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,399
and these controllers are

360
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
really great but you have to figure out

361
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
which setups the generators have so you

362
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
support a lot of different motors

363
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,839
alongside this stuff

364
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,639
and yes we get this running this is the

365
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,560
next event we will do is we check out in

366
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,000
the first how to communicate with the

367
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,079
generators you can commit complete

368
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,839
remote control it you can see everything

369
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,279
you can do everything

370
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,040
and uh yes still helpful to get events

371
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,680
running and see problems in the first

372
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
we had some problems on the l01 some

373
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,560
generator goes off don't try to sync and

374
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,399
the syncing doesn't work

375
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,079
so i've asked some power outage about

376
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,480
this um yes maybe a crack will have a

377
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,079
little bit more query of it

378
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,639
so if you have this remote access you

379
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,320
can see every configuration you can

380
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,600
change the configuration and see

381
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
problems it's very nice

382
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,639
so conclusion for our power this time

383
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,320
never ever trust rented equipment never

384
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,880
if the rental companies has tested test

385
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
it again if they say it's grounded

386
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,040
properly measure it

387
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
that's your tools for early delivery so

388
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,079
you'll have some time to react about

389
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,120
this if

390
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,839
stuff not coming right

391
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,800
so and rent least almost 30 of equipment

392
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,519
so

393
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,600
the plans never work oh i need somewhere

394
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,800
on we need somewhere oh we need some

395
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
power more this will help our people

396
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,160
and use more as one rental company so if

397
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,759
your rental company rented some stuff

398
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,839
either helpful you need more

399
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,839
if you only have uh some yeah can you

400
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,639
literally

401
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
turn down trend 21

402
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,360
and plan more time for build up

403
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,600
troubleshooting test time and your build

404
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,720
up schedule

405
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,199
seven days is really hard for this big

406
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,759
power so maybe starts three days earlier

407
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,279
and it's helped everything

408
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
jen said yes we get a lot of sata next

409
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,000
event always told we have a good monitor

410
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
in it fuel is little fixed broken turn

411
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,639
setups complete remote control

412
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,199
this will be fine

413
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,399
some things about teardown do not remove

414
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,639
please don't do it any of our

415
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,839
connections

416
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,360
we will do it there there's some

417
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,199
connection you can't

418
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,240
see a

419
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,160
problem unload will will do it not do it

420
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
please connect your staff so early as

421
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,600
possible

422

may take only your staff only and don't

423
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,639

we let them sell huh and please help us

428
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,360

many many thanks for our peoples

432
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,240
together help us on this time here to

433
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
get this event running this was very

434
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,639
nice here we had a lot of days we say oh

435
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,039
 out there drive home and the end as

436

thank you thank you thank you if you're

439
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,439
interested on the talk from the power

440
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,199
monitor and thus came the link is on the

441
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,880
sheets they will send you to the box

442
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,799
voxel reporter then many things

443
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,799
lexi

444
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,640
i think no unlock is coming

445
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,679
okay

446
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,679
have a nice well one welcome for the

447
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
knock people you get films all the nice

448
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,160
internet what you have and i pass over

449
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,880
to nikkodak

450
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,199
yes uh so

451
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,520
hiccup second microphone

452
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,640
hi i think we'll just pass on the

453
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,480
microphone give me a second to connect

454
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
the laptop

455
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,000
oh only one at the moment

456
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,840
yeah what would be easier yeah

457
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,440
hi i'm nico this is ion we are from the

458
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,840
noc we are doing the knock part of the

459
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,600
infrastructure of eu

460
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,840
and there's also a second microphone

461
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
thanks that makes it easier

462
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,400
test it

463
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,880
testing

464
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,559
uh so we'll jump right in uh to the uh

465
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,520
the network we've built for you here and

466
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
this is uh the

467
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,480
global network topology of uh what we've

468
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,679
built

469
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,640
this time we actually have

470
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,840
two external locations where we have our

471
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,760
edge routers for all the external

472
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,360
connectivity

473
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,280
that is in the

474
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
smart dc in rotterdam and the

475
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,960
nikkef in amsterdam

476
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
so there we pick up all of our transit

477
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,840
providers internet exchanges

478
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,039
and from there on we are

479
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,720
using 100

480
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,039
gigabit dwm waves

481
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,520
to get here onto the site

482
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,360
the next slide will explain a little bit

483
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,880
more about

484
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,640
how we're actually getting that to the

485
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
site

486
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
and then

487
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,960
here

488
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,160
in zevolde we have two data center quote

489
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
unquote data center locations we call

490
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,520
them e0 and l0 those are the the

491
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,480
concrete buildings you see for example

492
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,960
yeah like next to next to the noc yeah

493
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,520
next to the noctent and then the that's

494
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,200
the e0 and l0 is the building uh that's

495
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
sort of integrated into the scouting's

496
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,159
aventura house

497
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,720
um so there we yeah we have then those

498
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,039
two routers also interconnected with uh

499
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,840
100 gigabit and from there on out we are

500
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,720
downlinking uh towards the

501
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
well the various data and close we have

502
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
on the site and the switches

503
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,480
and

504
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,559
we have this time the opportunity to

505
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,400
actually multi-home all the data

506
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,280
enclosed so each data cloud has a two

507
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,919
times 10 gig uplink and it's also

508
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,480
redundant so if one router would fail or

509
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,720
if there's a fiber cut the data close

510
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,760
still has connectivity

511
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,400
so for the for the long haul uplink

512
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,480
to to actually get

513
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
the link from

514
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,760
here on site

515
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,280
all the way to amsterdam we have

516
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,320
a sort of complicated setup this at this

517
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
time because the

518
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,240
the dark fiber prices were very high to

519
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,720
go direct from here in jaywald to

520
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,799
amsterdam so

521
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,760
we have a

522
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,159
yeah we have a two-part connection where

523
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,760
we have a

524
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,480
rented the dark fiber from

525
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,679
zevolda to almira and from almeira we

526
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,919
have a sponsored

527
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,960
dwm connection from uh from surfnet

528
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,559
which is the dutch

529
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,678
research network

530
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,720
and on this

531
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
network we're using a

532
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,760
technology which is called a alienwave

533
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,480
so we are essentially able to

534
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,600
transmit a signal uh on a specific

535
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,440
frequency which they then

536
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,240
can

537
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
with surfnet can plug into their network

538
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,919
and they will transport it

539
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,760
from almera back to

540
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,120
amsterdam

541
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,200
and the nice thing about that is that

542
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,080
the

543
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,159
surfnet dwm network is quite large and

544
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,000
they also have a backup path so if they

545
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
would have a fiber cut

546
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,799
say from

547
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,720
the direct part from

548
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,919
almere to amsterdam they have a backup

549
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,120
path via hilferson so that's quite nice

550
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,080
the

551
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,320
dark fiber from here to elmira that is

552
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,039
just

553
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,559
yeah that's a single connection so if

554
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,520
somebody

555
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,400
would put uh some yeah

556
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,159
backhoe in the ground and the fiber

557
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,080
would be gone so

558
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,440
luckily everything went well so far

559
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,960
um and so yeah with this we

560
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
are yeah we're transmitting a 200

561
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,720
gigabit uh coherent dwm signal over this

562
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,559
and we're then using the 200 gigabit um

563
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,520
connection to break it out to uh 100

564
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,080
gigabits

565
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,120
yeah lastly we also have a connection

566
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
back to uh

567
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
we also have a connection back to

568
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,080
rotterdam uh that is also um for on 100

569
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,399
gig but those are a sponsored connection

570
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,240
uh yeah so for all for the for the

571
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,400
internet part of the uplink

572
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,360
we are running our own as again which is

573
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,480
uh

574
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,240
registered under event infra we have a

575
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,080
request at the temp simon from ripe so

576
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,520
we have a slash 17 of ipv4 space and

577
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,360
also we've loaned a slash 19 ipv4 prefix

578
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,200
from the ccc

579
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
well in terms of external connectivity

580
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,159
we have quite a bunch of um

581
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,240
transit and peering connections so we

582
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,760
have a few we have a few of them in

583
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,440
rotterdam and then we have a whole bunch

584
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,840
of them in

585
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,240
amsterdam and uh yeah so we have a few

586
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,080
of those connections running on 100 gig

587
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,000
and the others are running on uh 10

588
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,559
gigabits

589
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,159
you want to take the next one yeah

590
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,320
this is just i would say a list of all

591
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
the hardware dvd deployed on site we had

592
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,440
the two main core routers in the to

593
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,480
concrete building e0 and l0 which are

594
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,919
donated or loaned by juniper we also had

595
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,679
some more juniper devices from the

596
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,240
juniper loan and besides that we had a

597
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,480
whole bunch of arista switches and aruba

598
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,559
wi-fi access points deployed all over

599
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,159
the site in the dart and closed in the

600
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,000
track tents

601
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,279
at the bar at some villages

602
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,159
to get a decent network coverage

603
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,919
all the optical stuff like all the

604
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,200
optics are again loaned by flex optics

605
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,320
which was

606
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,880
is always quite nice from them

607
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,120
we also had quite a lot of servers

608
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,000
running on site to keep most of the data

609
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,320
or all of the data needed to run it on

610
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,240
site and not leak something out of the

611
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,559
site

612
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,240
this is just some some random pictures

613
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,760
we took during the deployment uh we had

614
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,679
you might have seen the noctent which

615
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,480
was quite huge which was also good to to

616
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
store all the stuff during deployment to

617
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,080
do the

618
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,960
assembling of the sticks you see for the

619
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
dart and close

620
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,360
we had saw some funny mounted wi-fi

621
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,840
access point which was upside down this

622
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,240
should not have been a bird feeder so we

623
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,480
put it up the the right way again to

624
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,320
stop water getting in

625
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,600
uh we did a brand new setup this time

626
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
the last time we used 10 gig by die

627
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,120
optics to connect all the dart and

628
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,000
clothes

629
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,320
and this time we thought oh we could do

630
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,440
uh some cwdm magic

631
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
so we had always four dart and clothes

632
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,279
in a ring we used 40g lr4 optics in the

633
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,559
car router

634
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,600
which

635
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,480
have four different wavelengths so four

636
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,880
different colors of light containing

637
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
10 gig each

638
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,000
and we broke out one of these colors in

639
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,520
each dart and glow

640
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,400
so

641
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,320
i would say one that enclosed with green

642
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,919
the other was blue and then we got red

643
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,960
and yellow

644
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,120
of course not these colors but just to

645
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,960
make it a bit easier

646
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,760
and we connected to them to both car

647
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,240
routers so one dart and claw had a east

648
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,120
connection on one wavelength and the

649
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,760
west connection on the other wavelengths

650
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,120
so there was a lot less fiber to deploy

651
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,720
for this setup

652
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,760
which sped it up by quite a while since

653
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,159
we had so many fiber already underground

654
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,440
the scouting site has some

655
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,520
connection between the

656
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,559
baton the the concrete buildings e0 and

657
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,679
l0 to the distribution cabinets you saw

658
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,679
in the earlier talk where the power

659
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,600
comes out they also have fiber

660
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,320
connectivity in there and we have

661
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,480
heavily used them to have backbone

662
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
connectivity on site

663
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,080
we had our own i would say branded cwdm

664
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,559
maxes from tallgrass

665
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,320
we had a thread shop over there to

666
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,200
assemble them ourselves to keep the cost

667
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
a bit to a minimum and they even have

668
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,039
the laser engraved fiber squirrel which

669
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,799
is with us since chem 15.

670
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,919
of course there was some dutton-claw

671
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,559
contamination again it

672
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,039
happens nearly to all the

673
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,440
events mostly during build up

674
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,159
i have the feeling that i'm it's mostly

675
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,880
happening to dartm clothes near some

676
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,279
tents which are being set up so i'm not

677
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,960
totally sure if this is the right

678
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,799
audience or if we should talk to the

679
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,799
tent builders but in case you come

680
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,799
around someone picking a dart and

681
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,200
clothes during set build up of the next

682
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,240
event please talk to them and

683
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,480
make them stop contaminating them it's

684
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,640
always fun to come in and replace them

685
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,480
on the last notice but it would a bit

686
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
more be a bit more relaxing if we didn't

687
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,320
have to

688
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,919
someone also thought that it would be

689
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,159
funny to put tamper-proof seals on the d

690
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,440
case

691
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,399
it was

692
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,799
kind of annoying but i'm also thinking

693
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,720
about if this would have

694
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,799
helped stop contamination during build

695
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,600
up if we put the seals up on ourselves

696
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,520
but since someone's taking the effort to

697
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,080
pick a lock i'm not thinking that a

698
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,679
temper-proof seal would make any

699
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,880
difference here

700
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
maybe we'll give it a try maybe not

701
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,039
we'll see

702
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,760
we operated the three on-site data

703
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,960
centers the biggest one was the e0

704
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,279
building right next to the top knock

705
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,600
tent behind the two generators

706
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,080
we hosted equipment in there for

707
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,720
basically all of the teams which wanted

708
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,480
to have on-site equipment hosted this

709
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,120
was the phone operation center the video

710
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,240
team the radio team with the on-site

711
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,720
motorola coverage was there the fifth

712
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,159
admin for

713
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,039
stuff

714
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,279
and of course our own systems like the

715
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,000
dhcp server dns automation was running

716
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,279
on site

717
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,440
as these concrete buildings have quite

718
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,679
thin walls um

719
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,159
they became really hot during build up

720
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,399
when we had over 40 degree around 40

721
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,840
degrees outside

722
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,480
the wall heated up to over 40 degrees

723
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,120
and the ceiling too so we had to put

724
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
three air conditioning units in there to

725
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,240
keep it to a usable level

726
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,640
which mostly shoved the whole the hot

727
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,039
air from the sun out the systems didn't

728
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,600
do so much

729
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,760
we also improved our net box setup again

730
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,919
we've been using netbox for our network

731
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,200
automation since camp 19.

732
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,159
we are expanding it constantly we have

733
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,720
great forks in the knock team developing

734
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,039
c3 cfg to generate all the

735
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,720
routing and switching conflict from

736
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
netbox and this time we also use netbox

737
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,240
to have all the patched fiber

738
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,159
in there last time we used them

739
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,320
spreadsheet for documentation now it was

740
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,840
in netbox too

741
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,240
we did the planning

742
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,760
we even used our tools to calculate

743
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,399
the fibers we needed so we have this

744
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,559
inventory of long fibers

745
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,200
and we knew which fibers we would

746
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,720
need on site

747
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,799
and our tools

748
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,880
helped calculating and picking the right

749
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,640
fibers for the right job

750
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,919
and then we fed this data back to netbox

751
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,640
we also use it again for device tracking

752
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,520
ipam and all the stuff we probably had

753
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,279
in our previous infrastructure reviews

754
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,679
yeah

755
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,320
uh so finally some statistics uh from

756
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,880
the network we've run here um

757
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
we have been able to

758
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,600
push the uplink uh on the so the receive

759
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,520
sides of what we receive on site that

760
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,000
went up to 50 gigabit

761
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,279
uh that's

762
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,760
somewhere yesterday evening

763
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,080
and transmit was at the maximum of 14

764
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,519
gigabit um we had around a peak of 2800

765
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,240
wi-fi clients on the network

766
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,080
over the course of the five days we've

767
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,960
seen

768
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,519
around 8 500 unique clients

769
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,919
and for some reason we've only seen

770
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,720
about 1 000 badges on the network so i'm

771
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,480
not quite sure if that is the right

772
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,960
number but

773
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,200
yeah and this time we had the

774
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,679
10 gigabit copper connections available

775
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,919
too in every dating flow

776
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,760
so what we've been able to collect in

777
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,919
terms of data is that we've seen around

778
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,120
25

779
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,960
connections actually running on 10

780
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,559
gigabit copper so that's quite nice

781
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,880
lastly there was also

782
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,960
one on-site internet exchange which was

783
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,519
uh run especially for the event which is

784
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,240
the mca

785
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,240
ixp

786
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,360
yeah um lastly so

787
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,880
running a network

788
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,679
like this uh cannot be done without

789
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,600
any uh sponsors so we have a quite a

790
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,440
long list of uh sponsors that are either

791
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,480
sponsoring or loaning a hardware

792
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,160
or

793
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,559
[Music]

794
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,880
giving connectivity

795
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,279
so the yeah i will go through the list

796
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,120
but it's junipers which we use for the

797
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,960
edge and core routers flex optics for

798
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,039
all the transceivers tallgrass who

799
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,720
helped with the

800
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,600
all the muxes you have also seen

801
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,960
i2d.net helped with co-location the dwm

802
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,159
equipment

803
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,120
and

804
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,799
transit uh babyl for uh the servers uh

805
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,000
bit for all the utp cables all the blue

806
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,399
utp cables you've seen on site

807
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,919
event infra

808
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,320
helped with the access network so it's

809
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,799
all the aristas and all the aruba access

810
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,240
points

811
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,360
surfnet

812
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,039
supplied the

813
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,399
the alien wave between almeira and

814
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,159
amsterdam

815
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,600
core backbone is ip20 provider ntt

816
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,880
as well

817
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,640
analytics

818
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,360
sponsors and internet exchange sport

819
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,640
a2b and physics and webcom all sponsored

820
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,080
ip transit connections and lastly i oh a

821
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,000
cross connect

822
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,679
in nick have for the mch internet

823
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,600
exchange is sponsored by attop

824
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,399
okay

825
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,679
so yeah

826
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,559
we also had some fun during the event

827
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,720
you all know most of the knock work is

828
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
happening before and after the main

829
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,720
event so

830
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,480
we thought oh it would be fun to have

831
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,200
some spliced fiber necklaces there it

832
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,080
was a bit hard as i heard but

833
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,240
it worked

834
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,320
so yeah that's basically what we have

835
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,799
thanks for attending the main network

836
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,080
will stay up until tomorrow today will

837
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,679
only tear down the track chance but

838
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,399
basic wifi coverage will stay

839
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
until tomorrow something in the morning

840
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,679
or midday thanks all

842
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,929
[Applause]

843
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:24,909
[Music]

844
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:48,960
hello

845
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,599
so a quick couple of facts about the

846
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,918
phones from the phone operations center

847
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,320
this time brought to you by the entropia

848
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,520
khalsa westwood labs um cars for midlong

849
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,440
and some friends

850
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,599
uh yeah what did we bring to this event

851
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,200
we uh

852
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,520
almost we have almost the same setup as

853
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,440
on sha 2017 so we brought about 26

854
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,520
decked radio base stations

855
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,200
have five fiber interconnected pbxs on

856
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
the field which connect to all these

857
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,560
decked antennas

858
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,880
uh controlled by two redundant pbx

859
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,280
controller vms with redundant ip

860
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,200
connections and also we do have 20

861
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,680
something field phones distributed

862
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,839
across the field which are manually

863
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,640
operated

864
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,320
some statistic

865
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,359
so we do have many calls handled we have

866
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,960
about 500 inbound as well as outbound

867
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,599
calls to the public telephone network

868
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,480
uh

869
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,599
connectivity to that was sponsored

870
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,839
from our friends at speak up which also

871
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,720
sponsored darlin at dialogue at shah so

872
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,520
we have a total of about 45 hours of

873
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,240
telephony to the public network mostly

874
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,400
to germany the netherlands austria

875
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,760
italia and belgium

876
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,040
yeah our deck network some statistics

877
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,400
no numbers just pictures

878
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,000
you can see an overview of our

879
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,680
charm map with all the deployed base

880
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,320
stations most of the traffic of course

881
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,800
happened around the center of the area

882
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,960
where the phone operation center

883
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,440
and all the other ocs resides but also

884
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,119
distributed across the field

885
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,280
coming to the availability we had no

886
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,680
time for downtime this year almost we

887
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,640
have like lost one antenna for about 10

888
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,200
minutes but the rest is just a nice

889
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,919
green graph

890
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,359
thank you very much

891
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,160
also many things from our side go to all

892
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,760
the angels who operated nearly 24 hours

893
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,560
a day the switchboard pbx to

894
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,359
have all the field phones connected and

895
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,200
provide the ability for everyone to

896
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,359
listen to the beloved waiting song boone

897
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,130
in the orn

898
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:19,839
[Applause]

899
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:20,880
yeah

900
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,680
some tech facts so um

901
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,599
one slight change

902
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,280
towards sha 2017 is that we have now a

903
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,359
working auto registration feature for

904
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,920
our dect phones so you don't need to

905
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,400
come again anymore with your phones to

906
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,960
the pog tent but just register them

907
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,480
yourselves

908
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,720
about 420 people have done that so thank

909
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,359
you for saving our angels many many

910
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,440
hours of manually registering dect

911
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,520
phones because that was a lot of work at

912
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,320
the last event

913
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,000
some

914
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,280
novelty we also had this time was

915
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,200
a bit of optical transformation because

916
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,720
we're using the on-site fiber network

917
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,160
which is mostly single-mode fiber and

918
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,280
we built some custom adapters to adapt

919
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
the multi-mode fibers which we have on

920
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,520
our old telephony system to the single

921
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,640
mode

922
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,400
on the on site so many things go to our

923
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,800
friend fabian who helped designing and

924
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,560
building these things also if you want

925
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,040
to check it out you can go to github and

926
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
visit the project there if you want to

927
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,680
build some sfp to sfp fiber adapters

928
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,160
yourself

929
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,200
regarding teardown the phone network

930
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,280
will probably be gone by the end of

931
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,599
today or the beginning of tomorrow

932
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,320
so if you have any land decked headsets

933
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,960
and charges from us please return them

934
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,119
to the pocket tent as soon as you don't

935
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,800
need them anymore

936
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,280
preferably tomorrow noon at the latest

937
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,160
so that we can pack everything up and

938
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
get offsite as soon as everything is

939
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,280
done

940
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,839
thank you very much

941
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
so um

942
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,359
yep

943
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,839
we are a production house team mainly

944
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,079
part of a couple of dutch people plus

945
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,280
vog

946
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,560
and these are our experiences of the

947
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,839
last

948
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,599
two and a half years

949
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,880
we prepared the event by starting with a

950
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,760
dutch

951
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,359
c3 vote note

952
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,960
in

953
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,520
in amsterdam together with the event

954
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,480
infra and the knocker team

955
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,839
and then

956
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,280
the logistics started to get all the

957
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,960
hardware here because after the last two

958
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,640
years we had a lot of

959
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,119
hardware dish

960
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,119
all over germany

961
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,720
and um

962
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,640
we planned to do some conflict

963
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,839
management changes

964
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,240
because uh

965
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,960
maintenance was needed

966
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,839
so build up during build up we had a lot

967
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,079
of fun because uh our logistics provider

968
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,319
was once again quite unreliable

969
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,560
um pick updates

970
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,160
they apparently don't know what they are

971
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,240
we haven't figured it out either because

972
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,760
they gave us estimates and then picked

973
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,160
it up a week later uh we also don't know

974
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,000
what drop-off dates are yet because our

975
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,520
logistics provider hasn't been able to

976
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,480
teach us that um and in some cases the

977
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,920
shipment has been routed quite

978
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,640
scenically uh we had like a shipment

979
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,640
going uh from near berlin uh to leipzig

980
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,720
uh to about homework and then

981
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,400
to somewhere in netherlands was quite

982
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,200
fun

983
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,839
um

984
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,760
yeah on the topic of contact management

985
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
we are starting we have started the

986
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,079
process of replacing our old and

987
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,480
outdated ansible conflict management

988
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,240
with bundle wrap

989
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,560
our team data center has rewritten

990
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,880
configs for all of the on-site devices

991
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,920
of c3v so the encoders the mixer laptops

992
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,880
the teleprize and the and our data

993
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,760
center

994
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,000
which required reinstalling all of the

995
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
operating systems during the event and

996
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,400
we've done all that within the last two

997
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,720
weeks

998
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,760
um yeah commit like there's no tomorrow

999
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,560
we've made a lot of changes and this is

1000
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,079
just like a part of that commit lock um

1001
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,720
we had around 100 commits or so at the

1002
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,560
like at the end of the event

1003
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,359
quite a lot of work

1004
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,800
so um during the event we learned a few

1005
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,440
things apparently these stands not are

1006
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,640
not

1007
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,560
waterproof

1008
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,880
which means the tarps and that little

1009
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
tent over there

1010
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,760
we also learned that long hdmi is quite

1011
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,119
unreliable especially with 4k

1012
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,920
signals and

1013
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,000
because the tvs are now almost all of

1014
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,920
them are 4k and

1015
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,440
we're not

1016
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,800
um one power outage we think

1017
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,359
killed an amplifier that

1018
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,800
amplifier controller that eight hours

1019
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,599
later decided to

1020
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,640
make a talk really unpleasant and to fix

1021
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,560
that up we removed one

1022
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,400
talk to a different tent but that tent

1023
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,640
was closed we couldn't use it anymore

1024
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
after the one o'clock

1025
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,560
and the dog would

1026
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,839
run over that so we decided we invented

1027
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,680
the silent stage which we'll show a

1028
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,839
picture of and we had an unfortunate

1029
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,680
incident with a mute button during a

1030
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,680
talk on the first arc on a more

1031
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,359
yesterday morning which we

1032
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,720
managed to

1033
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,960
re-record today

1034
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,920
oh sorry wrong button

1035
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,359
so we built a nice little tent

1036
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,640
to protect the equipment so that's a

1037
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,119
10 squared or something

1038
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,520
this is the silent stage you see a lot

1039
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,560
of people watching a bytecode jam

1040
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,400
with all connected with headphones the

1041
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,880
tent itself is completely silent until

1042
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,400
you put the headphones up and you had

1043
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,319
really nice music and commentary on the

1044
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,040
competition going on

1045
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,440
and we also had this thing

1046
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,640
apparently

1047
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,240
we are now covering all the insides of

1048
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,800
our equipment with uh mch dust which was

1049
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,760
already containing uh camp 19 dust and

1050
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,280
also maybe

1051
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,240
sha 2017 dust so it's time to open the

1052
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,720
cases again and clear them out

1053
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,599
yes c3 dust really did a lot of work who

1054
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,119
also did a lot of work for all of our

1055
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,160
angels we need five angels per talk plus

1056
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
an additional av technician to be

1057
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,960
intellectual at all times that gives us

1058
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,640
around 660 shifts for the whole event

1059
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
we had to do three angel introductions

1060
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,640
because of people apparently arriving

1061
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,160
too late for the first two introductions

1062
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,240
and on a personal note

1063
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,200
we would really appreciate it if people

1064
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,880
signed up for

1065
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
their shifts in advance and not just

1066
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,800
like five minutes before the talk or

1067
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,640
showing up during the talk

1068
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,319
it's quite stressful for us to have the

1069
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,480
angel system showing us a lot of angels

1070
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,560
missing for shift and having to deal

1071
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,760
with that

1072
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,240
and and and and uh

1073
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,920
showing up in a stage and there's like

1074
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,520
10 people because they all want to do a

1075
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,680
shift but they all forgot to sign up for

1076
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
it

1077
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,640
please do better next time it saves us a

1078
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,560
lot of headache

1079
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,960
during the night

1080
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,599
so yeah we also extended our voc network

1081
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,000
normally the voc network just contains

1082
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,640
our own infrastructure like the

1083
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,800
video mixer

1084
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,000
and the

1085
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,319
mixer laptops and all that

1086
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,720
this time we extended it a bit we also

1087
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,200
added the audio mixers into the walk

1088
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,440
network and configured them ourselves

1089
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,359
the in-room video mixing which is what

1090
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,599
is used to switch between the info

1091
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,480
beamer and the slides on the monitors

1092
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,960
and the big screen behind me

1093
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,200
was also configured by us and put into

1094
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,480
the voc network and we have made sure to

1095
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,720
save the configuration everything and uh

1096
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,280
that will be possible to reuse at future

1097
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,599
events uh it just allows a few

1098
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,680
comfortable comfort features like the av

1099
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,960
technician no longer has to run to the

1100
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,960
front to switch the input beamer but can

1101
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
just do it comfortably from the back on

1102
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,839
their laptop

1103
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,680
some some statistics we had 132 staged

1104
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,440
videos um

1105
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,359
we have released almost all of them at

1106
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,800
this point uh that's about 100 hours and

1107
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,720
20 minutes of video

1108
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,920
in total we had 118 angels four winky

1109
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,079
cuts and two unicorns

1110
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,240
and countless cuddles because apparently

1111
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,000
we are not only the video operation

1112
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,359
center but also the flower operation

1113
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,359
center

1114
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,800
uh some some colorful graphs we've got

1115
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,599
statistics about when uh the the stream

1116
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,520
was watched the most and when it wasn't

1117
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,079
uh very obviously nobody watched the

1118
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,680
stream during the night it's interesting

1119
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,200
the baseline of people that left their

1120
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,359
tvs turned on apparently

1121
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,319
um

1122
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,040
i

1123
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,960
can't say i have a problem with that we

1124
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,720
had quite a nice pause music during the

1125
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,480
event

1126
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,280
um yeah and to end we would like to

1127
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,480
thank some people

1128
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,160
we would like to thank uh spikersound

1129
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,599
who built the

1130
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,200
everything you see

1131
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
we especially like to thank holo plot

1132
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,480
who supplied these magnificent

1133
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,480
loudspeaker systems

1134
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,720
which can do much more than we were able

1135
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,720
to show you here we especially would

1136
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,599
like to thank the angels that helped us

1137
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,720
because

1138
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,839
we can't do this ourselves there's just

1139
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,119
10 of us

1140
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,839
10 of us roughly roughly and uh there's

1141
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,640
uh hundreds of angels that helped us

1142
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,000
and um

1143
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,520
personally as production highs i would

1144
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,200
really like to thank all the the people

1145
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,680
of c 3 work who always make this a

1146
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,559
really fun experience to do these events

1147
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,319
and uh we hope to see you soon on the

1148
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,640
next event and lastly thanks to all of

1149
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,400
you if you weren't here to watch the

1150
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,319
talks there wouldn't be no reason for us

1151
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,710
to produce them so thank you

1152
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,100
[Applause]

1153
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:45,259
[Music]

1154
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,680
hello

1155
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,839
i'm representing the herald team

1156
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:02,880
and

1157
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,720
you're nearly done

1158
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,119
so the herald team is a new team most of

1159
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,359
the people were not heralds before or at

1160
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,280
least not at hacker events

1161
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,559
we had

1162
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,839
people from 15 to 77

1163
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,520
heralding

1164
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,680
in upper coast and everywhere so

1165
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,400
i think this is quite awesome

1166
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,040
we covered three stages and one herald

1167
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,240
desk

1168
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,520
with all these

1169
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,720
23 people we had a talk coverage of all

1170
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,119
the talks that required a herald which

1171
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,000
is all beside of something like

1172
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,839
lightning talks

1173
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,280
this were 1372

1174
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,680
as some talks were repeated

1175
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,160
we did some twice

1176
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,200
and

1177
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,680
we also looked slightly into the

1178
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,400
workshop tents and

1179
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
well we also covered some of those that

1180
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,720
didn't need a herald

1181
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,760
we had

1182
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,520
zero empty or late or missed shifts

1183
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,559
which is

1184
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,160
awesome for this event

1185
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,520
we had an average team member

1186
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,480
talkspad team member was

1187
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,520
5.73 whatever

1188
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,240
so um some did quite much

1189
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,480
some did not so much but had other

1190
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,680
things to

1191
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,079
manage like children and stuff like this

1192
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,880
so very thank you to all the heralds

1193
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,400
um we had 181 herald shifts with these

1194
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,640
23 heralds and a lot of back office

1195
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,920
things are additionally happening

1196
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,400
so

1197
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,880
i'm used to speaking with store cards

1198
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,079
as a herald

1199
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,079
not as a presenter so we had some other

1200
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,800
numbers um we also had to monitor the

1201
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,839
co2 levels in the tens which stayed fine

1202
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,160
beside of the time when we had these

1203
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,240
gems session going on here and we were

1204
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,880
actively blowing co2 into the 10 and

1205
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,520
well the number went crazy but i think

1206
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,960
we could manage this

1207
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,599
but we had to open up the tents for heat

1208
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,480
because

1209
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,200
it was quite hot in between

1210
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
um i hope you

1211
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,000
yeah

1212
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,599
wouldn't be

1213
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,720
yeah i went i hope it was okay so

1214
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,160
we used 450 torque cards or we went

1215
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,960
through 450 of these nice talkers

1216
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,119
we ate two birthday cakes because one of

1217
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,680
our heralds had birthday and was then

1218
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,640
doing herald shifts

1219
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,359
which is great i think and we used a lot

1220
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,079
of water sunscreen and heads

1221
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,240
well also mata um

1222
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,200
we had 21 different announcements even

1223
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,800
if you probably only remember two or

1224
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,240
three and

1225
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,240
sleep about them so actually we had two

1226
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,760
complaints reaching us the others

1227
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,960
probably were held up by the sides some

1228
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,160
thingy uh complain booth or something

1229
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,000
that so the complaints were that we were

1230
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,119
repeating too much the same

1231
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,280
announcements

1232
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,640
uh yes

1233
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,359
we

1234
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,839
earned four sets of parking and trash

1235
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,640
angel patches if you want some you still

1236
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,880
probably can get them by doing these

1237
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,760
shifts you probably saw them all

1238
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,240
but we got four sets because we were

1239
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,400
showing them to you well we lost two

1240
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,559
sets if you find some please send them

1241
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,040
over to hardworking angels

1242
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,839
um

1243
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,119
we had one speaker being hit by a name

1244
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,839
by a herald um there was a mosquito or

1245
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,558
something i was told

1246
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:39,200
yes

1247
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,720
and we had one field telephone call

1248
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
so somebody actually was using them

1249
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,760
great

1250
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,720
um

1251
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,960
yes then i have to tell you drink more

1252
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,800
water and now i can happily announce

1253
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,319
the content theme i guess

1254
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,240
there's some weird signs

1255
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,960
the content team we usually don't get

1256
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,880
the content team and we don't learn

1257
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,720
about all the back work

1258
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,960
about the speakers and all of this so

1259
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,120
here's the content theme

1260
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:20,960
[Applause]

1261
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,319
you'll have to give me a minute while i

1262
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,880
unlock my laptop

1263
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,320
[Music]

1264
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,880
cool

1265
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,760
uh

1266
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,000
hi i'm from the speaker desk slash

1267
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,839
content team we work quite closely with

1268
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,880
uh ketazi from uh herald's coordination

1269
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,000
uh

1270
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,440
we don't have grafana so i'm afraid

1271
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,920
there'll be no pretty pretty graphs but

1272
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,920
we do have some statistics and fun

1273
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,440
things to share so over the last

1274
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,559
what uh four days you have hopefully

1275
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,680
enjoyed

1276
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,000
uh 233 sessions from

1277
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,640
179 speakers uh i'd just like to give a

1278
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,240
round of applause to everyone who did

1279
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,920
submit to our cfp there were loads of

1280
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,920
awesome submissions unfortunately we

1281
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,839
couldn't accept everything uh but thank

1282
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,280
you to everyone who did submit and

1283
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,119
particularly those that did present if

1284
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,319
we could just give them a round of

1285
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,319
applause

1286
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,599
so that was made up of 144 talks over

1287
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,280
these three stages 61 workshops across

1288
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,119
more than three workshop tents i think

1289
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,800
four or five uh 27 music performances

1290
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,119
over on the music stage four percent by

1291
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,760
uh our very own dj in team content uh

1292
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,040
one film with subtitles uh a fire dragon

1293
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,400
which was over there if you didn't see

1294
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,040
it

1295
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,119
and loads and loads of village content

1296
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,839
uh

1297
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,599
some of which was in our official

1298
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,359
program some of which wasn't there was

1299
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,280
loads of awesome stuff happening on the

1300
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,640
train and i hope you managed to see some

1301
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,680
of it

1302
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,160
so some other statistics uh we had 1.5

1303
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,800
mobile apps a iphone app

1304
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,559
and an android app that we never

1305
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,040
finished i never finished

1306
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,160
we did 25 schedule releases through

1307
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,440
pre-talks which is the conference

1308
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,720
management system

1309
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,680
over the just during the the four days

1310
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,040
that we have been here

1311
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,359
uh we had unfortunately five

1312
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,880
covert cancellations speakers that

1313
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,880
couldn't make it uh

1314
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,520
they got covered uh we we feel bad for

1315
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,200
them we hope they're okay

1316
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,880
we did have a fridge this year which was

1317
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,000
awesome

1318
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,680
we also had a drag queen which i

1319
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,960
understand was very popular um

1320
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,720
and we lost track of how many passport

1321
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,440
stamps we gave out to people um

1322
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,720
we also

1323
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,520
had a load of speaker stickers they were

1324
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,200
gold and shiny

1325
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,040
like that and they disappeared from our

1326
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,880
tent halfway through so if you do know

1327
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,240
where they are we would love to have

1328
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,079
them back

1329
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,359
because we do have other speakers to

1330
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:04,839
give them

1331
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,720
to so our hurricane order uh

1332
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,240
this is important because we give the

1333
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,760
speakers free drinks when they come to

1334
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,000
us um and we have managed to order i

1335
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
don't know if this is the most that the

1336
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,240
team has ordered i suspect probably not

1337
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,520
but we have ordered

1338
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,960
that amount

1339
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,280
of stuff quite a lot of mate

1340
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,280
uh which we have given out to our

1341
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,359
speakers uh if you want drinks please

1342
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,280
submit to the cfp next year

1343
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,720
um

1344
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,599
and some less sensible statistics

1345
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,559
we had two of our auger late to their

1346
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,520
talks

1347
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,520
which created one miffed herald

1348
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,680
we had three talk reruns because of

1349
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,000
unfortunate av issues

1350
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,440
we had one water-related uh power

1351
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,440
failure in our tent uh where it tripped

1352
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,559
the uh the breaker and then when it got

1353
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,559
really really hot um it actually uh

1354
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,880
heated up our thermal thermal cut out

1355
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,640
and tripped it again

1356
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,920
um we had one pre-talks server migration

1357
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,599
thank you to to wildtap for doing that

1358
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,160
halfway through yesterday i think

1359
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,040
um

1360
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,640
as you can see on the back of our gator

1361
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,480
we have a how am i driving

1362
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,720
sticker we had two suggestions on how we

1363
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,839
could improve our driving

1364
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,599
i don't know what that says about us um

1365
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,079
we had one faulty bulls wagon

1366
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,799
which destroyed the fibre two fibers i

1367
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,680
think from noc we're really sorry

1368
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,040
and one broken like label printer thing

1369
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,200
they cost 50 euros and it got really hot

1370
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,558
and and melted in the machine

1371
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,280
um and unfortunately we have one talk

1372
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,480
that's overrunning which is this one

1373
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,480
it's the only one so i'm going to

1374
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,720
