brani benani is how i cuddle her

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,880
and that was the name of a project so we

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,119
started the website then people said

23
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,200
like that's kind of stupid this is uh

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
hiro branni and kaiko in a government

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,799
system it looks like this then somebody

26
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,119
said like stop using cat names then the

27
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,560
minister said you can use cat names so

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,640
this is what we are going to talk about

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,600
today and with the corona tech there are

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,180
a few

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,439
[Music]

32
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,680
projects that we have to do

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,479
contact racing contact racing app

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,159
the

35
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,680
i talked about

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,479
the

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,759
the eu dcc the qr codes

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,920
um we built a

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
ehr for hospitals

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,040
in six weeks times we have exception

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,920
routes um we do fraud protection red

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
teaming and we are also supporting the

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
other nations in our kingdom

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,520
aruba and sid martin so that's a lot to

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,479
deal with and then what do we need to do

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,959
of course the continuous monitoring

47
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,520
and you have all the occasional issues

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,599
the shortage of people the high stress

49
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,560
level

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,480
especially the political environment

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,520
that you're in and then all the tasks

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
you have to do starting with pen testing

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
code reviews ending with your risk

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,520
assessments and your weekly starting at

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
7 00

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,040
pm on a saturday

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,080
ddos it's those standard things you have

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
to deal with all the time and with a

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,680
small group of people doing that that is

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
kind of a hard

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
thing

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
now i've been in security for over 30

63
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,400
years and

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,040
over 40 nearly 40.

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,760
and um one of the things i've learned

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,400
from the thousands of incidents i saw is

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,280
whenever hits the van

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,640
a

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,879
configuration management database is

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
totally different from reality on the

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,959
left hand side you see amsterdam in 1538

72
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,200
and that is generally the map when you

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,920
end up at an incident that they give you

74
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,120
this is amsterdam in reality

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,480
so

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,040
yeah and and for my colleague cleo sorry

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,000
but uh this is the harsh reality

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,879
so

79
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,120
this needs to change and this is an

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
issue for us as well and then

81
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,480
what we're doing to prevent incidents is

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,440
basically finding the famous needle in a

83
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
haystack

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
and as i've shown you we've got all

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
sorts of projects going on and different

86
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
nations to support so basically i'm

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
searching in more haystacks than

88
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,040
basically would fit on a powerpoint

89
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,440
slide

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
so far so good then the game this day

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
when we had this corona testing facility

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,360
that was hacked by the dutch news author

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
outlet rtl news

94
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
and basically what they found was a

95
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,920
google firebase that was in development

96
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,879
mode

97
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,720
and yeah then you can go through all the

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,079
data

99
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,279
and parliament said um to the minister

100
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,000
you have to

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,080
investigate all these parties yeah but

102
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,120
it's not a job yes you have to

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
so we started continuous monitoring and

104
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,800
that was for up to 70 companies at the

105
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
same time

106
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,040
there isn't a single security company

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,880
that will say like oh sure we'll help

108
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
you with this one

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
um because it's highly political

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,479
sensitive it's all open so there we were

111
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,759
so we did

112
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,919
a lot of manual scanning in a weekend

113
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,080
found hundreds of vulnerabilities at

114
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,120
these

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
at these facilities

116
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
and then the next

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
question came okay now we've sent the

118
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
information over

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,280
how do we know for sure that it was all

120
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,039
fixed and then you start scanning again

121
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,039
and then this company will go like no no

122
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,360
no there was nothing wrong it's a false

123
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,280
positive

124
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
of or

125
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,240
it wasn't really a problem

126
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,560
and then we found other stuff as well

127
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,639
for instance one of these

128
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,880
facilities basically said like okay

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,479
we've got secure meal

130
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,039
for healthcare applications

131
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,560
we let them

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
be part of our system

133
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
and then somebody by accident discovered

134
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,919
that they turned that off because you

135
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,759
have to buy a subscription of a couple

136
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,919
of euros per month that apparently was

137
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,360
too expensive

138
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,240
how do you monitor that altogether

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
so

140
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,600
there were a lot of issues and it's not

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
even that simple because there's one

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
other issue as well it's not only about

143
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,360
security it's also about what makes

144
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,240
us as team but also the minister

145
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
vulnerable

146
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,080
and that might also be security issues

147
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,440
that aren't there

148
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,560
so we stopped talking about security and

149
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
we started to talk about everything that

150
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
makes you vulnerable

151
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,880
that really doesn't scale down the

152
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
problem

153
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,160
so we decided to go for a tool and

154
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,039
since we're talking about

155
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,520
vulnerabilities the dutch word is quetz

156
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,720
by hayden

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
and we want to analyze them and it's a

158
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
tool so we call it the quest behavior

159
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
analysis tool

160
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,840
and for behold that's the dutch word cat

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
for the ones that were in my lecture

162
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
yesterday

163
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,319
this is our team logo that

164
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,720
is perfectly fine for the tool as well

165
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
so we learned a couple of lessons and

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
one of the things that we should do

167
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,120
is prove that if we found something

168
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
that this is really true

169
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,360
and if something changes i want to be

170
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,560
alerted

171
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
and i don't know what can change but if

172
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,319
anything changes i want to be alerted

173
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
and then we found that there were

174
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,599
basically no tools that really

175
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,560
understood the dutch context properly

176
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
let alone the medical context so long

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,360
story short

178
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,000
um we needed something that

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,759
would be able to scan would be able to

180
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,400
do other stuff but um

181
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,638
also doesn't violate the dutch laws

182
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
all one could say i was looking for an

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,520
aya lake in the world miksao

184
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,319
so how do i realize this

185
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,319
help

186
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,400
so i phoned my friend jan klopper

187
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,960
and said like yum help and john is a

188
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,639
hacker

189
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,540
oh

190
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,879
[Applause]

191
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,120
i have i know i have aged a bit yes it's

192
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,000
true

193
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,960
um

194
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,800
so yeah we had a problem

195
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
and and bennett decided on calling me i

196
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,080
don't know why but you know these things

197
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,000
happen well i picked you because you

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,560
were allergic to cats this is true yes

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,319
uh but you didn't know that back then

200
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,639
yeah and the first thing you say said

201
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,080
was

202
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
stop throwing data away

203
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
yep

204
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,039
so what we see in

205
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,360
the general availability of security

206
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
tools that you

207
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,280
start scanning and the end product is

208
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,199
always you know the vulnerability that

209
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,120
you find the end product is always this

210
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,880
report saying you have to fix this you

211
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,200
have to fix that

212
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,599
but to get there you're probably gonna

213
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,760
you know do a lot of queries collect a

214
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,360
lot of information

215
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,479
and

216
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
all of these tools next to each other do

217
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,480
that again and again every time they you

218
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,800
know do a dns query do a you know

219
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
connection to the server collect some

220
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,320
information parse it in their own way

221
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
make their own answers put the answer in

222
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,480
the report and you get only the answer

223
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
from the report and we decided to

224
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
do it a bit differently and say okay

225
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
each one of these little steps

226
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
should be should be a little program by

227
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,839
itself the unix philosophy

228
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,000
and every time we do

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
one of these little loops we're going to

230
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
collect the information

231
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
both raw so we can actually prove that

232
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
we did it

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,240
and we're going to collect whatever

234
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,800
comes out of it in the database

235
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
how do we prove it

236
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,760
good question

237
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,040
um

238
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,360
so we decided on running all the tools

239
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
in containers

240
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,080
very fancy

241
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
but it you know it it's not a means to

242
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
an internet it's actually something that

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,040
helps us

244
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,959
and we run the container for example

245
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,440
nmap very simple tool we run it we

246
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,640
collect the information that goes into

247
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
the container the ip address

248
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,279
we collect um the version the hash of

249
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,399
the image

250
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,880
and we collect whatever comes out of it

251
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
and that gives a pretty good pretty good

252
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
complete answer of what the tool did

253
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,279
and then we allow someone else an

254
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
external party to sign that package hash

255
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,320
it sign it timestamp it so make sure you

256
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,399
prove what we did so basically the

257
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
external timestamp surface make sure

258
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,320
it's forensically sound

259
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
correct and then we do that for every

260
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
step along the way

261
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,680
while collecting information to build

262
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,040
this graph

263
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,519
yeah and this graph we built

264
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,760
in a cross-time database so that we can

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,680
see the status of an object in all

266
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,120
moments in time

267
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
so i can

268
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,600
compare an object on january 1st

269
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
around midnight to the status of the

270
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,279
object right now

271
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,279
yeah so we have the graph

272
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,600
and the graph that we have today might

273
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,279
be slightly different than the graph we

274
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
had yesterday and that allows us to

275
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,240
obviously see the differences

276
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,760
but since we have this database of

277
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
information we have all the little nodes

278
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,959
of information we can use that graph to

279
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
then and only then

280
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
start looking for patterns start looking

281
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,120
for objects start looking for things

282
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
that we don't like in our graph in our

283
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,839
reality

284
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,160
um within our set of business rules so

285
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,519
if you

286
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,600
if you put everything in objects you put

287
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,079
needles with needles and hey with hay

288
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,399
yep so if you say i'm looking for a

289
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,480
needle then basically you can say hey

290
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,240
here's a better here's your bunch of

291
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,880
needles yes

292
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,000
okay

293
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
the question is how do we get the daiita

294
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,600
and we get

295
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,839
data with buffus you're going to

296
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,440
to you're going to learn a little bit of

297
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
dutch as well buffy is the dutch word of

298
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
rescue

299
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,560
and basically it's a plugin yeah so we

300
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
have a bunch of different plugins and

301
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,079
buffies is the first one

302
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,160
and it's the one that goes out and gets

303
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,640
data um it goes on the internet or it

304
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,360
goes you know look at the various tools

305
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,640
or apis

306
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,720
um or maybe in internal or external

307
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,519
databases and it only you know it has a

308
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,920
question it goes and fetch the raw data

309
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,519
doesn't really matter which format it is

310
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,240
in

311
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
and it collects it to be stored in our

312
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
forensic database

313
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
they are just facts

314
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,360
so

315
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,760
in a regular tool

316
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,200
for example if you run nmap um and a lot

317
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,680
of tools will immediately say oh you got

318
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,160
port 22 open don't do that

319
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
i don't care about party you know it's

320
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,440
fine do whatever you want

321
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,839
i get that a pen tester you know

322
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,240
probably has a reason not to do port 22

323
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,360
on the internet

324
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
but that's a business rule

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,519
and the business rule comes later

326
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,040
because we made a distinction between

327
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,839
facts and conclusions i have got this

328
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,120
guy walking around along canada and he's

329
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
basically always doing a finding and

330
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,680
then saying like okay

331
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,240
you have to decide if it's important for

332
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,800
you or not so he says like okay breno

333
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
i'm looking at your house

334
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,920
i see

335
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,480
smoke coming out of the roof and flames

336
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,279
if this is important to you

337
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,440
the logic step would be to dial one one

338
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,320
two and ask for the fire brigade

339
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
optionally optionally optionally you

340
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,399
know i don't i don't know what you're by

341
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,480
the way i call him my chief conspiracy

342
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,680
officer

343
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,560
um

344
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
we have a whole bunch of

345
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,839
plugins already we need a lot more so

346
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,519
um

347
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,680
i'll do the shout out now come to open

348
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,639
cat

349
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,360
tent and join uh join the scene

350
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,560
but then i've got data and data is still

351
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,519
something that is unstructured

352
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,720
yep

353
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,959
so by now we've ran all these buffers

354
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,000
and we collected all this raw

355
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
information probably just command line

356
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,480
outputs or json blobs from somewhere

357
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,519
and

358
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,600
in that data is a lot

359
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,560
extra information

360
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
we need to process that to actually you

361
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,079
know make sense of make needles

362
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,480
and what we do is we have a separate set

363
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
of plugins normalizers or whiskers as we

364
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,240
call them and we

365
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,000
you know we couple each whisker either

366
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,160
to a buffer to a mime type and say oh

367
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
let's see we have text html forensic

368
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,880
proof what can we do with that we have

369
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,639
nmap output what could we do with that

370
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,440
and we scan that data

371
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,880
from the store

372
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,240
check it and if we find something that

373
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,760
we understand then we add it to the

374
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,880
database

375
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,279
but

376
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,160
today i understand only so much

377
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,440
and then all these people are going to

378
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,279
help and then i understand i know more

379
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,440
yes i know that's very interesting

380
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,399
so imagine having this you know vault of

381
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,240
data that you collected over many many

382
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,839
years over systems that you you know

383
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,199
have in production

384
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,480
um

385
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,839
and and

386
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,639
you know you had done this as you would

387
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,399
because brendo asked you to

388
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,480
and

389
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
it's a good morning you wake up and you

390
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,160
notice there's something wrong with your

391
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,880
website cpus are spiking every time a

392
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,480
browser visited and you find um

393
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,920
a bit of javascript code in there and

394
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,240
it's bitcoin mining

395
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,160
so it's essentially destroying the

396
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,040
planet

397
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,079
um

398
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,160
you find that bit of bitcoin code the

399
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,720
cryptominer and and you notice that you

400
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
you obviously missed it because you

401
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,360
didn't know it was there

402
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,680
what you can do from that point on is

403
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,519
you know collect that information you

404
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,680
write a normalizer that looks for this

405
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,519
specific bit of javascript

406
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,360
add it to cut to open cut and it will um

407
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
probably find another few of these you

408
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,000
know injected bits of html or javascript

409
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
in your various sites

410
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
because we had already downloaded all

411
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,399
the html we had already you know

412
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,839
collected the proof

413
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,920
so you can immediately start fixing

414
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
these things

415
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,160
but

416
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,600
you also have all the historic

417
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,519
information in your forensic store so

418
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,440
now the normalizer can start working

419
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
backwards over all that over all that

420
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,720
collected data and you know pinpoint the

421
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,399
moment in time because you know we have

422
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,279
a

423
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,920
crosstime database

424
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320
where you know where we saw that bit of

425
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,399
javascript for the first time

426
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,320
and this obviously helps with

427
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,399
pinpointing you know when you were

428
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,519
attacked

429
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,839
um and by having that you know specific

430
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,399
moment you can probably also

431
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,240
dumb it down and you know look at other

432
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,079
log files to see how the hell they came

433
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,000
in because you know

434
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,199
seeing a bit of javascript in your

435
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,680
website is one thing knowing how they

436
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
got in is probably you know very

437
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,199
expensive

438
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,639
research yeah a bit of expensive

439
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,560
research yeah yeah and then we store all

440
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,199
the data in bytes is that one of my cats

441
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,800
definitely not it's simon's

442
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,519
but we store it forensically in our data

443
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,720
store

444
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,880
and then basically we go for the

445
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
business rules

446
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
yeah so business rules

447
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,440
very enterprising name i know um

448
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,120
business rules are

449
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
more or less like complex css queries

450
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,519
and

451
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,519
you have a set of data you have a tree

452
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,680
of information and what a business rule

453
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
actually does um we have one on screen

454
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,079
here it says okay every time an ip

455
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,079
address is added to the graph

456
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,759
i'd like to be ran

457
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,480
so it's more or less a state machine and

458
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,720
it does collect some other additional ip

459
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,880
information so ap port and websites

460
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,359
might be related to this ip address

461
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,640
and then we do some python magic

462
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,959
run over some crates and websites

463
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,599
we collect some ports and

464
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,439
you know if we have all the ports at

465
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,280
this computers and we can do this bit of

466
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,119
logic saying okay

467
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,720
if port 80 is open or port 443 is open

468
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,480
or not

469
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,919
you know then there's probably something

470
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,360
wrong

471
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,480
if so we'll add a finding yield defining

472
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
to the database and what this does is it

473
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,679
creates a new object in the graph

474
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,280
so if a exists b must also exist

475
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,000
but a or b or c you know this might be

476
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
more complex queries we try to keep them

477
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
simple and that opens up for instance

478
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,160
one possibility is that you say like

479
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,880
okay yesterday you had five ports open

480
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,679
today it's 12

481
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,919
maybe your firewall configuration is no

482
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,919
longer good yep but there's more

483
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,679
if i see that you're running a bit of

484
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,559
software for example wordpress

485
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,400
i can do you know

486
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
a query over all software instances i

487
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
can see that you're running wordpress if

488
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
this is wordpress

489
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,360
then there must also exist these other

490
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,600
1568 dependencies

491
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,919
it's deduction it's very simple

492
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,679
it's a simple business rule

493
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,200
and the business rule feeds on external

494
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
information and it you know it handles

495
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,120
every bit of wordpress in your site or

496
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
whatever you want yeah right there is

497
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,520
this nice example of the this this

498
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
corona test street they were using

499
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
wordpress and a new

500
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,480
common film nobility exposure came out

501
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,280
and that basically um

502
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,320
gave a cvss score of 9.8 which is kind

503
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,760
of serious

504
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,280
so after they after we downloaded it

505
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,000
i phoned the director of that testing

506
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,360
street and

507
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,679
within 10 minutes of getting the alert

508
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,440
the website was fixed i can't prove

509
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,160
that we prevented the hack but likely it

510
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,880
we did

511
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,120
yeah so the business rule was triggered

512
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,000
again when we renewed the list of cves

513
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,039
and

514
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
the second that happened we added all

515
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,360
the extra facts to the database yeah

516
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,039
there's only one thing you know the

517
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,520
buffers get the data

518
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,679
the bites feed them to the whiskers the

519
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,039
octopus

520
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,600
octopus is what we call the

521
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,480
the system that basically um does all

522
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,880
all the handling of the data and then

523
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,600
ultimately it ends up with bits

524
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
and bits is basically uh i'm sorry we we

525
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,880
run the bits and then basically you can

526
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,280
do your reporting etc we've obviously

527
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,760
got the interface for that

528
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,880
um

529
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
one of the interesting things yeah i'm

530
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
not happy oh yeah

531
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
one of the interesting things about

532
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,720
these bits is that like i said they add

533
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,200
data and objects back into the graph

534
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
they don't have to be findings but you

535
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,000
know they could be

536
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,960
and

537
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
once you alter the graph

538
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
you can then you know have another set

539
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,799
of bits

540
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,400
looking at that data again and say oh

541
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
wait a minute if you have that little

542
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
technical issue

543
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
then you're not compliant with for

544
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,600
example internet.nl and if you're not

545
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,880
complied with internet i don't know

546
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,480
we've added a finding for this saying oh

547
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,159
you're not compliant with this

548
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,600
then we can add you know another

549
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,799
business rule saying oh if you're not

550
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,559
compliant with internet rnl you're not

551
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,360
compliant with um nta

552
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,640
75 65.6 which is safe email for the

553
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,799
healthcare yeah so you can you build

554
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,840
these really big compliancy questions

555
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
and you know strip them down into

556
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
smaller technical questions simple

557
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,559
queries

558
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,720
yeah there's only one thing that i'm

559
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,960
totally not happy about

560
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,600
and that is um so far i have to do

561
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,720
everything myself start it click it

562
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,840
so

563
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
we've got a scheduler

564
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,919
mula another cat of one of the

565
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,280
developers

566
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,360
mula is our scheduler and we're now kind

567
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
of in you know in the

568
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,799
volume of search engines um

569
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,200
so we have lots of objects and every

570
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,720
object that we add to the graph either

571
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,120
triggers a bit or business rule but they

572
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
can also

573
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,360
be input for another set of buffers

574
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,880
if we find a hostname doesn't matter

575
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
where we collected it from

576
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
then we can probably do a bunch of

577
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
things like you know

578
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,960
dns queries we can try and see if

579
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,880
there's any sub-domains we can look for

580
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,480
certificates

581
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,400
via transparency um records so deciding

582
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,640
on which booth used to run

583
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,159
and in what you know what order

584
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,000
is something that the scheduler does

585
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,559
also deciding on when to rescan

586
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,080
some things don't need to be resched

587
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,000
every day some do

588
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,120
so if we're re-scanning then i can also

589
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
see that if somebody fix something it is

590
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,520
fixed correct yeah

591
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,919
so if we see something broken today

592
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,080
we collect proof of that and by the time

593
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,559
we rescan either manually or through the

594
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,000
scheduler

595
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,720
we also collect evidence on when you

596
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,760
fixed it

597
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,080
which is obviously very very useful

598
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
yeah but now we need to use the real

599
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,039
life practices and we need yeah need

600
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,919
some help for that

601
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,760
because i don't know how to do that so i

602
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,440
would like to invite oscar kuro

603
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,320
if he still dares

604
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,120
well actually the joke the actual joke

605
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,470
is

606
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,400
[Applause]

607
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
the actual joke is that this is a

608
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,480
government-approved picture in an actual

609
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,280
uh

610
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,039
interview that i gave

611
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,480
but let's face it

612
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,559
with respect to what my day job is

613
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,640
because my night job is yeah well having

614
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,520
fun and doing stuff but uh on the day

615
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,600
job site my responsibilities for an

616
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
entire ministry

617
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,919
consists out of uh depending on how you

618
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,799
count either 11 or 25 or even more

619
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,480
organizations

620
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,679
so i know what kind of things are

621
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,480
coming to me with respect to uh how to

622
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,320
prove that you're compliant how to prove

623
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,840
that you have your security in control

624
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,760
that you prove that your privacy

625
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
controls are if you can test them with

626
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,679
technical means that they are okay

627
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,159
yeah but before we do that now that we

628
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,840
are the three of us

629
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,799
um we need to get the op cut out

630
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,320
yeah and that needs to be published

631
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,120
so

632
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,559
when did we do that

633
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,000
uh we did it we did that on july 1st um

634
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,039
at 2200 hours and in the next morning we

635
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,200
got a call from davide

636
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
the nice guys who were before us and

637
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,559
good going

638
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,919
and we had the information disclosure so

639
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,640
i dare to say open source seems to work

640
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,520
yeah so thanks to the work of them that

641
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,679
they actually looked at the code so

642
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,919
quickly so fast and found something that

643
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,120
we've missed

644
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,200
it's that's the thing that i think it's

645
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,799
it's what open source should be well not

646
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,159
just us

647
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,320
i think it speaks to you know why we do

648
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,360
open cut

649
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,760
yeah many people have been looking at

650
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,440
you know at open cut

651
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
including some companies yeah

652
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
and we all missed it

653
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,360
and i think this is also one of the

654
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,600
examples again because we've seen all

655
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
kinds of other improvements that we've

656
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
had in the talk that we've had with

657
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,440
breno and and ron

658
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,880
in other days

659
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
that open source can work if you

660
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
actually put your mind to it and do the

661
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
right steps and then this can work again

662
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,159
so it's really appreciative okay but

663
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,919
your mission is really to make cat

664
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,919
holistic mch

665
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,460
um

666
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,539
[Music]

667
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,320
make cat holistic i'll slide you know

668
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,679
i'll let it slide that this one is not

669
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,250
with decay

670
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,080
[Applause]

671
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,400
so one of the goals is that we can scan

672
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,799
all the resources that we can actually

673
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,960
get from the infrastructure and if we

674
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,760
can't then use the agent services

675
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,320
which is going to be a lot because the

676
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,480
amount of organic organizations that you

677
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
have to deal with with the pandemic

678
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,159
that's fine that's a lot but the

679
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,440
ministry itself has at least

680
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,679
it's a bit bigger and i've got more

681
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,919
suppliers even to deal with and each of

682
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,600
them need to be compliant and the

683
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,720
compliance

684
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,200
rules and regulations will improve

685
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
because of all the yeah this thing only

686
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,159
works if the objects are being filled so

687
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,520
if you've got sufficient assets

688
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,960
to add discover assets well if

689
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,400
this is one of the things that i had to

690
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,240
do myself in the weekends because that's

691
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,880
the night job is try to scan

692
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,720
the infrastructure itself and then

693
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,159
discover oh my gosh we have more apis we

694
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,080
have more things to do more things to

695
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,840
control and everything is getting more

696
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,880
and more

697
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,039
so we need to have scale

698
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,880
in what we do

699
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,200
and this is why i think this is a cool

700
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,480
thing that we have

701
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,720
now is that we have the opportunity for

702
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,840
scaling

703
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,760
yeah and the cool thing is if you really

704
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
understand this um

705
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,240
think of log4j

706
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
what did most organizations do they

707
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,320
started scanning the moment the house is

708
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,400
on fire

709
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
collecting you know collecting where

710
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,679
log4j was

711
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,120
even included

712
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,880
um we didn't know i didn't know what it

713
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,679
was i mean i know java but that's about

714
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,600
it

715
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,039
but we already knew where it was yeah so

716
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,360
one of the yeah fridays if i'm not

717
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,559
mistaken i looked at the code kudos to

718
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,559
the northwave guys because i thought

719
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,000
that was the most readable python

720
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,960
implementation of scanning log4j then

721
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,080
extending that and then well telling to

722
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,039
the guys hey look i've scanned

723
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,960
the entire ministry at least from what i

724
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,159
could get

725
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,520
please help me

726
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,080
i need to make it into the service

727
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,279
yeah

728
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,960
and sharing is caring sharing is caring

729
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,919
so

730
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,000
so and yeah what

731
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,880
we also do is we also have to be open to

732
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,320
parliament and state look this is what

733
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,200
we do

734
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,559
and one of the important thing is that

735
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,960
we don't just keep it to ourselves and

736
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,880
but also make it available for all the

737
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,720
other ministries who have the same

738
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,880
challenges well not just ministries i

739
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,559
mean

740
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,880
and then we can go big

741
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,600
bigger

742
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
and why why limit ourselves to that yeah

743
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,720
there's all the friends that see cert

744
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,520
who

745
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,919
are going to scan hospitals with it

746
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,840
so that's kind of cool

747
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,480
there are so many opportunities

748
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,360
yeah

749
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
well this is basically the overview if

750
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,279
you want to know more there is time for

751
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,080
questions we did deliberately um left

752
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,960
some time for questions if we can think

753
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,720
we can understand if it's hard for you

754
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,480
to think about questions so we thought

755
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,840
of a couple of questions

756
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,880
um for you i still have questions so you

757
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,799
should have questions as well

758
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,360
exactly and if you don't dare to ask

759
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,240
questions now come to the open cut tent

760
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,520
and ask um questions then

761
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,399
any questions

762
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,640
hi

763
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,559
i was wondering if there's uh

764
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,960
there are plans for an api

765
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,279
yeah um so

766
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,799
the question was if we have any plans

767
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,360
for apis and i'm guessing you you mean

768
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,600
to extract data from cat and use it

769
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,279
somewhere else right

770
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,679
yeah also to configure it

771
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,600
um yeah sure sure so uh cat is open cut

772
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,320
is built out of various containers um as

773
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,919
you saw you know we have bytes the

774
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,600
forensic store you can use and interact

775
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,360
that with that

776
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,240
if you

777
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,159
skip the buffiest part and inject data

778
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,159
right into bytes the normals will pick

779
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,279
them up

780
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,200
you can also query bytes as well and you

781
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,279
know get data out of it

782
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,000
octopus same story you could add objects

783
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
there you can

784
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,600
query octopus for objects at any time

785
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,679
yeah just as with granny bernani what we

786
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,799
did is

787
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,480
make a big problem

788
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,159
and that's actually what i learned from

789
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,600
mendel moba

790
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,240
if you have a big puzzle make it a bunch

791
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,480
of small puzzles so what we did is

792
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,919
that's why we have all these little

793
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,440
projects

794
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,799
so that you make it a little bit smaller

795
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,120
yep

796
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,600
hello congratulations on building and

797
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
releasing such an excellent tool i have

798
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
a question regarding the forensics

799
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,120
collection and the keeping data

800
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,320
why discard it do you keep pcaps of all

801
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,640
your scans and if not why not

802
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,799
very good very good question thank you

803
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,880
yes it's on the roadmap and yes we have

804
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,720
promised this and no we don't do it yet

805
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,600
so

806
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,120
since we're running all the containers

807
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,440
with the buffets in there um it's a very

808
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,120
logical question and a very logical

809
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,039
thing to also collect all the network

810
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,960
traffic that is being generated because

811
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,760
you know

812
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,559
nmap might just output something but it

813
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,159
you know might have seen something else

814
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,960
it might have been collecting data

815
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,200
and once we have that data we could

816
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,600
easily make normalizers to scan through

817
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,440
that data as well scan through the pcap

818
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,360
files and you know

819
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,000
pick them apart and and collect even

820
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,840
more data points from there because we

821
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,080
might not know what we're looking for

822
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,919
you know until we discover this in the

823
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,919
future and also have the proof on what

824
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,919
kind of data we've actually sent out

825
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,559
over the network per scan or in this

826
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,679
case repair per container yeah so one of

827
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,600
the reasons we do this uh there's

828
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,159
actually two main reasons why we why we

829
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,000
do this we

830
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,600
want to make sure that

831
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,120
if we scan

832
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,279
that we have a proof of that we actually

833
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,240
scanned

834
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,760
this is something that's missing from

835
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
lots and lots of uh

836
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
pen testing reports did you actually

837
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,039
scan this i don't know

838
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,760
so if for example you do n mapping on on

839
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,600
an ip address and if it doesn't return

840
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
any ip addresses or ports does it show

841
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,080
up in your pen test

842
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,440
i'm guessing not

843
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
um how do you prove that you've actually

844
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,320
scanned it

845
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,480
by showing that you know you have the

846
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,679
input you have the output you probably

847
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,240
have the pcap file somewhere then you

848
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,000
have actual proof

849
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,159
that you've done your work and that you

850
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,679
didn't find anything

851
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,399
but if for someone like a reason nmap is

852
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,360
broken in that version and it

853
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,200
skips port 22

854
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,559
um

855
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,480
i want to make sure that i have proof of

856
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,559
you know running that specific version

857
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,000
and doing my job

858
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,919
i have run yeah there is a very good

859
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,960
reason for that there was this one case

860
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,799
where i was involved in this incident

861
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,559
with the city

862
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,159
with a city in the east of the

863
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,760
netherlands and they got fully

864
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,159
ransomware and then there i

865
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,279
stumbled across this

866
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,000
pen test and it didn't say that rdp was

867
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,880
open

868
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,039
but the funny thing was when you went to

869
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,120
showdown i could see that all the days

870
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
of the pen test

871
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,840
except one or two this port actually was

872
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,919
open so how can that be

873
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,679
and this is why you want to have that

874
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,080
proof

875
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,240
excellent answer thank you um also if

876
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
you're negotiating secure connections

877
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,559
like tls keep a copy of all the keys

878
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,519
that you've negotiated we do yes thank

879
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,320
you thank you

880
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,480
yeah so

881
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,279
my question was about your cmdb you said

882
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,399
it was not complete enough is open cut

883
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,720
more complete than you seem to be

884
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,559
there or is it more than it is

885
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,840
no it but

886
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,080
no i would not say that at this moment

887
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,799
definitely not but um this is why we are

888
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,360
focusing on the asset management

889
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,080
um because this is what you really want

890
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
and of course we'll draw all your

891
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,919
inferences from that

892
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,440
modern cmdbs have extra modules to scan

893
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,080
the network and have from actual

894
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,480
collections of whatever agents or

895
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,519
whatever data input you can then state

896
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,679
oh look the cmdb is not completing these

897
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,159
kinds of elements but today yeah and

898
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,840
today we got actually an offer of

899
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,919
somebody who um

900
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,880
who is looking in making in a buffer

901
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,559
that connects to ac cmdb so yeah this is

902
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,720
what we want to trigger as well

903
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,640
yeah there's two two rounds there

904
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
actually so you can use

905
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,440
you know you can use your existing cmdb

906
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,159
or

907
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,880
admin panel or whatever to feed into

908
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,720
open cut saying hey i have these assets

909
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,399
please scan them

910
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,840
you could go the other way as well and

911
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,120
say

912
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,360
let's scan everything that we can find

913
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,600
and then have a business rule saying

914
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,919
if there's something in the open cap in

915
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,080
octopus in the database which is not

916
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,640
present in my cmdb

917
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,559
there's a finding right something's

918
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
missing in your cmdb so

919
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,720
you can use both ways you know whatever

920
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,679
you want to do with it

921
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,080
um you said you scanned log files and is

922
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
that from outwards inwards the reason

923
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,480
for the question is like um if you have

924
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,679
normal users using the system you log ip

925
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,040
addresses and then maybe the gdpr comes

926
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,159
into play

927
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,960
if you say you have them hashed uh uh

928
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,199
subscribed that this is uh wasn't

929
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,799
changed how do you handle that

930
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,199
we're just looking at her we're not just

931
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,679
you know figuring out the answer um

932
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,119
[Laughter]

933
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,879
so a bunch of questions in there

934
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,879
actually so yes we are currently

935
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,800
scanning from the outside in

936
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,760
and

937
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,960
that means that we're not collecting

938
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,159
information on clients for example

939
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,040
but

940
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,839
we are working on um having more run

941
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,320
times so internal run times like uh in

942
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,639
your network in your vlans possibly even

943
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,679
agents

944
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,839
um that are on your

945
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,640
and collect raw files like forensic

946
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,000
information and then we can normalize

947
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,520
that and build the graph

948
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,760
once you start doing that obviously you

949
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,520
might you know

950
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,040
get personal information in there and

951
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,240
then you obviously have to deal with

952
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,440
that

953
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,040
the way

954
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,880
you do that is

955
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,400
defined in the model

956
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
um and you can we don't have it yet but

957
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,480
we can probably add something like

958
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,040
encrypted models saying this has a you

959
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,920
know a key rollover after so many months

960
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,160
and it you know gets destroyed

961
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,880
through that means um

962
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
at the moment we don't use any

963
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,400
we don't have any objects that actually

964
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,440
collect

965
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,040
private information

966
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,720
because we as the ministry don't want to

967
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,800
do that

968
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,560
nothing's stopping you though from

969
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
creating these models and adding these

970
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,800
boofies yourself and also of course we

971
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,640
already have the name spacing that makes

972
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
it possible to do internal scanning as

973
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,880
well and we've already got the project

974
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,960
name for that and that is kitten

975
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,040
cat on a pie small cat kitten

976
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,830
okay thank you

977
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,020
[Music]

978
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,760
hello and congratulations on this

979
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,119
beautiful product

980
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,320
and

981
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,079
my question is really since this does

982
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,040
look like a bunch of awesomeness

983
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
this is bound to take off

984
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,200
it means that more people want an open

985
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,240
cat

986
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,160
and one day a different ministry or

987
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,839
hospital is going to come along and says

988
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,160
we would like to get an open cat

989
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,200
instance

990
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,280
but we would like to get help with that

991
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,680
is there a company that can do that for

992
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,480
me and the question is have you

993
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,760
given any

994
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,839
thought about a

995
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,880
hybrid commercial ecosystem

996
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,960
around this because it is the question

997
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,520
is going to come um

998
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
yeah john

999
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,680
ian and i had a lot of thursday evenings

1000
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,520
so one of the bullet points missing on

1001
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,079
my slide is cereal entrepreneur um

1002
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,599
because it's so cheesy

1003
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,119
um

1004
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,079
my mic is cancelling sometimes but yeah

1005
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,960
have been thinking about this um

1006
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,680
but obviously we just want to do this

1007
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,720
within the industry first um someone

1008
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,960
else is bound to you know take the

1009
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,240
source and you know take it build some

1010
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
some cloud platform out of this we don't

1011
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,000
know we do have the name for it though

1012
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,599
it's gas

1013
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,440
get there's a surface yeah

1014
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,640
so you know

1015
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,720
we

1016
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,800
we have in fact done half the work

1017
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,920
already but uh breno how much

1018
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,240
introductions and stories do you tell

1019
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,480
how much presentations do you

1020
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,680
give about

1021
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,119
cut to how many people we have

1022
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,280
don't like dozens and dozens of

1023
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,920
presentations which time frame i think

1024
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,960
dozens per i think we've done about 150

1025
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,760
demonstrations uh in the last so so that

1026
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,800
means you are lighting a fire

1027
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,920
of enthusiasm oh yeah

1028
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,839
and i speak from from experience i would

1029
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,599
very much urge you to

1030
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,160
get the thinking done barely but it's

1031
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,320
open so hey here's your commercial

1032
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,040
option but i must say look open yeah but

1033
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,119
it's not open look it's on github

1034
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,280
download clone do what you want no no

1035
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,560
it's it's

1036
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,880
the thing that i like about this is that

1037
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,200
it's being told there's a story being

1038
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,119
told there's a story behind it why a

1039
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,320
philosophy

1040
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,960
and this is also being told at each of

1041
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,640
the presentations

1042
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,800
not just to look how cool this quote

1043
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,359
this tool is no why did we do it and how

1044
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,880
do we do it and this is also one of the

1045
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,440
first well let's face it tries from a

1046
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,079
ministry perspective to

1047
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,079
share something that we've built for

1048
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,880
ourselves to a wider community way

1049
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,119
beyond the scope of what we do this is

1050
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,640
not quite the place to hash this out but

1051
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,800
let me

1052
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,160
i want to tell you i'm super

1053
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,640
enthusiastic and i'm more worthy that it

1054
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,400
will be

1055
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,680
that it will get too hot and

1056
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,960
so i have a i have a theory about this

1057
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,920
um

1058
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,599
if you're in

1059
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,359
in this kind of space and you're

1060
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,560
innovating um what happens is as soon as

1061
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,320
a commercial company

1062
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,839
stumbles on something that makes

1063
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,760
money the sales drones come in that

1064
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,240
could become terrible but let us yeah

1065
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,079
well i'm i'm available for further

1066
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,240
discussions because i i did it once and

1067
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,760
it nearly failed

1068
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,359
but i've got the feeling that we are

1069
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,160
going to have some grappa at the entire

1070
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,920
i'm looking forward to it

1071
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,640
but

1072
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,440
yeah

1073
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,960
thank you

1074
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,599
this is my cue

1075
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,040
urgency

1076
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,599
there is a grappa emergency going on on

1077
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,320
mch there is no more grappa at the

1078
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,720

stealing your mic to auction it off

1109
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,040
i i have a very

1110
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,560
serious question

1111
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,760
and that is uh what is free cut and how

1112
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,839
does it

1113
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,800
work frequent is stupid because it's the

1114
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,440
cop website made by anian

1115
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,520
and um

1116
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,319
i don't like it the funny thing is

1117
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,560
anion presented free cut to us after we

1118
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
you know launched the open cut website

1119
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,960
and i couldn't resist and put free cut

1120
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,079
uh nl in open cut the software

1121
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,590
um

1122
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,440
[Music]

1123
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,839
and then asked anayan what are these

1124
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,520
and he's like oh is that said online

1125
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,839


1126
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,040
yeah exactly

1127
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,560
older than the the poster

1128
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,359
so in that case is the relation between

1129
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,599
free cat and open cat comparable to the

1130
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,040
relation between free bsd and open bsd

1131
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,490
no

1132
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,680
[Laughter]

1133
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,599
at this moment

1134
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,560
it's politically charged

1135
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,839
i think it's complicated that'll be the

1136
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,280
status okay i have one statement and one

1137
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,119
silly question the first statement is i

1138
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,200
have some experience in open source

1139
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,880
stuff and government

1140
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,760
uh please listen to baird

1141
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,160
[Laughter]

1142
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,400
please we we will

1143
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,359
uh

1144
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,920
so why the comic sans i'll give you the

1145
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,680
question

1146
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,119
[Music]

1147
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,040
why was one slide because it's really

1148
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,119
honest i actually find the content of

1149
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,640
the comic slide

1150
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,160
kind of interesting

1151
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,839
yeah the the comic sans was basically

1152
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,880
made um because i wanted to annoy anyone

1153
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,400
because i can

1154
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400

1156
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,800

too in control but nobody did tell us

1182
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,079
no we don't think so because those are

1183
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,560
all the findings but there we go

1184
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,359
i think that's the false positives

1185
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,200
unlikely

1186
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,720
thank you very much indeed for a very

1187
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,820
interesting talk thank you

1188
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,050
