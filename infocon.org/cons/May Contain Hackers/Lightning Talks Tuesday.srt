00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,800
hi everyone so as mentioned i am boris

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,439
and he is redone we usually hang out at

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,400
the local hackerspace in albania which

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,720
is a country in the western balkans

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,439
we have helped co-organize open source

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,840
conference albania for the previous

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,200
editions

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
in 2017 we did our first crypto party

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,239
together with aryan campus and we

11
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,840
managed to

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,600
with the help of the municipality of

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,960
tirana published on openstreetmap a lot

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,360
of geographical data regarding the city

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,039
of tiranga

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,160
we also help them migrate to nexcloud

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
which is an open source solution for

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,039
managing your files and it's a solution

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,920
they are using to this day

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,479
so before going into what our little

21
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,680
project

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
it's very important to give some context

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
about

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,799
so it's a lot of different people here

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,040
so it's a bit important to also know the

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,880
local context where you come from

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,479
apologies for the albanian but i will

28
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,880
explain these are news news from

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
some articles that are related to this

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,479
talk as well so in 2009 we in albania we

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,840
had the first known data leak

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,960
that happened and what all the data from

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
the

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,840
civil

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,720
registry which means name surnames ids

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,360
they were leaked and they are also you

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,680
can find them also today unfortunately

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,079
and this was the first known case we

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,520
don't know if there are other cases as

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,119
well

41
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:49,920
and

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
basically after this in 2013 this was

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
between the changes of the government we

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,479
had the election that the elections that

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,920
year and what happened is that

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,079
people went to the central tax office in

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,759
the physical servers and they were

48
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,079
caught on video and they stayed it for a

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,880
night

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
they went out and they lots of data were

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,360
deleted which was pretty big

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,440
until this day for both these cases we

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,560
don't know uh if there are prosecutions

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
in

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,640
play people that are other than the i.t

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,360
specialists that were working there

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
unfortunately and in 2016 another

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
interesting case of

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
you know not respecting the digital

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,360
rights was

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
an ms

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,480
catcher's

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,360
hardware and software package were sent

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
to albania from the italian government

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,720
to support

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,760
the ministry of internal affairs on

67
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
uh you know how to do proper uh

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,319
surveillance in cases that

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,040
the

70
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
police needs to investigate uh but what

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,120
happened is that the

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
the minister of internal affairs kept

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,080
the hardware

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,480
uh and all the everything with it for

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,840
one year

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
and uh it was suspected that it was also

77
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
used without any notification of anyone

78
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
other than the ministry of internal

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
affairs at the time

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
and also this was a big scandal but for

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440
us unfortunately it was very sad because

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,840
uh in in the public discussion this was

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
not

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,519
not debated at all it was just a

85
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,760
political issue and nobody was talking

86
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,599
about digital rights and how bad this

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,480
was

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
at the time

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,120
so we were

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,680
frustrated that this was not being

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599
discussed at the time

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,400
and

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,319
of course the same

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,760
situation

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
happened it escalated in 2021

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,879
with more data links yeah so ever since

97
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,720
2021 we've been getting a few more data

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
leaks and these ones have been far more

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,159
comprehensive

100
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,400
the first example happened in april of

101
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,799
2021 where the data of 910 000 voters

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,439
was exposed to the public and we're

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,519
talking stuff like social security

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,920
number your leaving address your phone

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,519
number the license plate of your vehicle

106
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,879
and also later more daily escape

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,720
so it's the one-third of the population

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
basically because albania has three

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,959
million people so approximately and if

110
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,560
you look at the collection of the data

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,798
it's pretty clear that these data are

112
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,880
have gotten out from governmental

113
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,080
services

114
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,199
so in summer of 2021

115
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,000
uh it turns out that one of the parties

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,880
in albania was using this data as a way

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,400
to study let's say the voters and see

118
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
how they can turn this into their

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,639
advantage so for each person who had

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,360
a

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
name all the id and some comments for

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,960
example radon

123
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
he is affiliated with our party or he is

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,240
not if he's not affiliated with our

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
party we need to talk to him so that we

126
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
we change so it was a proper database

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
but the data were from different

128
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
governmental agencies in one yeah

129
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,199
which was pretty and this was the first

130
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,880
time that the

131
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
the concern about digital rights

132
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,560
was went big

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
in albania which made us happy and sad

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
at the same time for obvious reasons

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,400
normally the leak of such data because

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
you can't really change your social

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,639
security number for example is that it

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,720
really shocks you and it takes some time

139
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,039
for you to process what happened however

140
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,360
what happened in albania was in summer

141
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,880
2021 these data came out and then less

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
than six months in december our salaries

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
became public so all of the salaries of

144
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,360
everybody who's working anywhere were

145
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,080
now

146
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,120
open for the entire public and at least

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,280
the data set was free you could download

148
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,520
it for free so there's that

149
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
okay you seem shocked

150
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,639
okay

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,240
there is more we have ten more minutes

152
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
so no worries

153
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,520
so in my in uh may 2022 which is

154
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
some months before

155
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,560
our government decided

156
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,840
pretty

157
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
fast that every

158
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,000
governmental services 95 of governmental

159
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
services will go

160
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,639
through a

161
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
governmental portal so whatever you need

162
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
as a paperwork you have to go through

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,840
there

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,880
which is

165
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
might be a good idea or bad but if you

166
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
do it fast

167
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,639
things bad things usually happen as we

168
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,360
all know so for more context a lot of

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
the population in albania is not very

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
tech literate and most of them don't

171
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,160
have the tools to access this interface

172
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
so another phenomenon that usually

173
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,800
happens is people go to internet cafes

174
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,960
and ask people there to sign up their

175
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,919
account

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,840
which when we're talking about the

177
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
account you interact with with your

178
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,479
government

179
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
that might not be the greatest idea out

180
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,479
there and and also it's not only this

181
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,120
that people don't know how to use it

182
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,479
it's also that

183
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,880
my parents for example they are old my

184
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
mom has a burner phone it last time it

185
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,680
was charged it was 2008 probably

186
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,759
and has no acci it's not a smartphone so

187
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,639
it has

188
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,039
it's very hard so everyone is trying to

189
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,560
help their families

190
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
to get into this

191
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
and because this went on very fast it

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,039
was launched very fast

193
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,400
uh last

194
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,639
like before us coming coming here one

195
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,360
week or ten days before it was hacked

196
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
so until now

197
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,599
but hacked means nobody knows because

198
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,520
there is not a proper report right now

199
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,560
of how many data how it what happened

200
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,240
and et cetera et cetera

201
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,360
and uh what we do know is that our state

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,800
was offline for four weeks for two weeks

203
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
and uh

204
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,919
when we were at the plane coming here

205
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,919
like switching airports

206
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,880
um

207
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,400
they were they were the people that did

208
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,319
this they started leaking also whatever

209
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
they have found gradually so anyway this

210
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
is sorry about this but it's important

211
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,199
to have a lot of context and uh

212
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,520
one last case i will not talk about any

213
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,599
breaches we will not talk about branded

214
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
bridges anymore so in 2009 it was

215
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,479
introduced a law that said it was a very

216
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,479
vague law that said that the police has

217
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,840
the right to

218
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,879
to do surveillance without any

219
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,240
request to a prosecution to a prosecutor

220
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,560
which in in i don't i'm not a legal

221
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,599
person but we are we we know that it's

222
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,720
unconstitutional in the first case so

223
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,319
you need there there needs to be checks

224
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,319
and balances right so

225
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,440
yeah

226
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,639
there tends to be a little pattern going

227
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
on with how our digital rights are being

228
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,960
respected

229
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,039
and he's into memes because he's younger

230
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
than me so yeah i'm i'm an internet kid

231
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,799
so

232
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,159
so the the public rhetoric always was

233
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,159
we don't know about this tech thing also

234
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,000
journalists that we talked all the time

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
they said we don't we don't know like

236
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
it's very complicated to us we don't

237
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,720
understand and also the the general uh

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
argument from the governments not only

239
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
one but in general is that these things

240
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,360
happen to every government even the ones

241
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,399
that we

242
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,240
think that are more have more bigger

243
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
budgets they happen all the time this

244
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
was the first argument and it still is

245
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
today and the second was you've heard

246
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
this before well you have nothing to

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,399
fear if you have nothing to hide and i

248
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,240
i'm not mentioning who started saying

249
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,120
this first see this saying is quite

250
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
controversial but

251
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,839
i think it's kind of right because

252
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,080
if the government has nothing to fear

253
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,320
they also should have nothing to hide

254
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,680
well what this means as i mentioned

255
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,560
before the the general rhetoric is

256
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,360
it's this is okay it's normal it happens

257
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
and uh we say yes okay but we need to

258
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,360
raise awareness about this

259
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,560
and also as boris mentioned these things

260
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
should apply transparency and having

261
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,399
nothing to hide should apply to the

262
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,959
governments too so we we teamed up with

263
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,040
a team of uh

264
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,080
a group of people that are uh

265
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
artists a collective of artists and they

266
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
were they were they're doing this

267
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
project called manifesto

268
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,160
uh hijacking and

269
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
the the way the the reason they

270
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
mentioned that is the hijacking there is

271
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,399
because we want to change the rhetoric

272
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,959
of the whole situation so

273
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,399
their collective the collective is

274
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,839
talking about other issues that are

275
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,079
concerned in albanian society and our

276
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,240
our focus here is what's happened with

277
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
surveillance and the digital rights in

278
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,680
albania as well

279
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
so

280
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,640
that's why we launched the

281
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
nothing to hide.the buttockcenter.net

282
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,320
which is a

283
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
a map

284
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
of mapping

285
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,040
uh points of surveillance in

286
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,839
albania starting from tirana this is

287
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,519
yeah so this is tirana right here and if

288
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,240
you see this little area right there it

289
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,120
has 62 cameras surveilling public area

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
so if you open one of them up you can

291
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,959
see more info on that one important

292
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,320
point

293
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
we are not mapping all the cameras we

294
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
are only mapping cameras that are

295
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,120
pointing

296
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,440
in the public space

297
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
and these are business cameras because

298
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,680
they are they they need by by law to

299
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,880
have

300
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,360
uh which is also a vague law

301
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,279
which says that you need to monitor your

302
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,120
your business if you are in the city

303
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,680
center or anywhere else uh but they

304
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,360
don't specify that you need those not

305
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
only to map

306
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,000
your privateer your property so these

307
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,760
are only cameras

308
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,240
that are in the public public area and

309
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,760
also these are

310
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,920
done in in a few amount of time which

311
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,040
means we're going to do this until

312
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,959
september right

313
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,200
the most craziest thing i've seen so far

314
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
i was in in the seaside

315
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,959
uh

316
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,920
and uh this is uh what's the name it's a

317
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,480
mole like it's a in the it goes in the

318
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
sea and it has this uh wooden

319
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
things that

320
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,040
structure

321
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,720
and a pro a hotel that is really far

322
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
away from this

323
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
had put monitoring cameras there and

324
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,079
when asked

325
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,160
around why this is happening the answer

326
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,079
was like i don't know because we can

327
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,160
nobody told us that we cannot do this

328
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
right so you go to the beach the beach

329
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,040
is public space by this definition so if

330
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,200
you go to open street map it's right

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,160
there

332
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,720
and if you cannot see uh from the

333
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
distance it's not just a camera it's two

334
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,760
and actually more more

335
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
along the way so

336
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,680
that's a fun spot and so it's a

337
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,240
combination of governmental practices

338
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
going bad but also not having awareness

339
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,519
of what you need to respect in terms of

340
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
you know other people's privacy and

341
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
digital space so i'll go really quickly

342
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,320
into the tech behind it uh we are

343
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,959
running ushahidi which is a platform for

344
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,440
crowdsourcing data so it was perfect for

345
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,320
this fit we are hosting in a very stable

346
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,800
data center called my bedroom it's

347
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
usually open nine to five

348
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,000
for the base map we use openstreetmap

349
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
and we just render the additional points

350
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,079
on top for the license we want to have

351
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,920
this under public domain because it's

352
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,839
crowdsourced data but this might be

353
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,920
tricky so there is still discussion

354
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,040
going on

355
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,560
one important thing about this is that

356
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
we after we launched this

357
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,440
two things happened people started uh

358
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,360
like we we did some workshops in the

359
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
city uh

360
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,560
telling people how to do it it's very

361
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,320
easy we're gonna have some screenshots

362
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
you just take a photo geolocation and

363
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,000
so here is the form where you're filling

364
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,959
the data it says geo data a photo and a

365
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,800
short description and and

366
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,959
the the idea is that we are trying to

367
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
make it easy for people to do this but

368
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,800
going back to the public domain thing we

369
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,240
also people were saying oh this is super

370
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,639
nice it's like pokemon go which also is

371
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,560
funny but also very concerning at the

372
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,880
same time because it's it's a game if

373
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,720
it's being gamified

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,839
uh but

375
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
we also got some researchers saying that

376
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,160
hey we need can we can you give us this

377
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,680
data because we need to do some more

378
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,399
research and also some people that know

379
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,800
the context of the law so that we can

380
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
have even more

381
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,079
uh outcomes out of this right

382
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:56,880
so

383
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,120
yeah this this is the project

384
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,959
and uh

385
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,560
follow me there as we say during

386
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,439
some time

387
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,839
well thank you so much i never heard of

388
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,880
this and it's

389
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,560
well it's not amazing obviously it's

390
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
awful but it's such an interesting

391
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,560
subject and you i think it's amazing

392
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,680
what you've done

393
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,760
um if there are any questions there are

394
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
mics in the middle oh we're gonna get

395
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
questions if you're comfortable with

396
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
that we didn't do it that's the answer

397
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,800
for all the questions we are not the

398
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
ones to do it no i'm joking no they

399
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,880
didn't they didn't do anything like what

400
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,760
yeah we're innocent no obviously not um

401
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,480
they didn't do anything just so you know

402
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,600
um well thank you then okay thanks and

403
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
uh another applause if there

404
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,240
[Laughter]

405
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,680
yeah i just heard from an anonymous

406
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,440
source that if there are questions you

407
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,160
can ask them

408
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
okay

409
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
hey

410
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
thank you um so when did you launch the

411
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,199
app was that this year

412
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,920
yeah yeah that happened this year two

413
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,120
months ago yeah how popular did it get

414
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,160
so as of right now we have around 100

415
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,199
data points 96 of them are just in

416
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,199
tirana sorry it's a up to 106 right now

417
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,680
last night it was a hundred though so

418
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
yeah but it's these are only i think

419
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,079
from from what we've observed these are

420
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,959
only a few of them and until september

421
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,920
uh

422
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,079
we expect to have more people what we're

423
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,600
doing right now is doing some workshops

424
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,880
so that people

425
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,440
understand how they can contribute there

426
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,120
but we're expecting based on what we see

427
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,880
around it there are many many more

428
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,040
cameras that we can see and not only in

429
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
tirana in other cities in albania as

430
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
well see the thing when you start

431
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,120
mapping here is you know there is a lot

432
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,680
of public cameras around but you never

433
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,079
really think about how much there are

434
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,839
and how much on the street you're on

435
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,720
right now so this project really helps

436
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,959
it helped me as well with putting that

437
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,560
into perspective

438
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,680
thank you

439
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,279
great question if there are any other

440
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,839
questions

441
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
yes oh one more

442
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
thank you for this talk if you could

443
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,240
lower the mic

444
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,120
have you thought about

445
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,079
maybe rolling this out in other cities

446
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,160
in other countries

447
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,079
i'm sure there will be

448
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,279
quite some animus and enthusiasm

449
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,079
for it i know i know in my city in my

450
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,800
city i would like to replicate this

451
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,759
so

452
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,360
i i know

453
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,199
after we started this we understood that

454
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,880
there are also some other cities doing

455
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,199
this so new york has people in new york

456
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,759
have done this and in london which i

457
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,560
think

458
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,399
we know that it's very has lots of

459
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,440
cameras

460
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,000
but if we are once we do all the

461
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,079
gathering of the of the data in tirana

462
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,839
we'll start documenting the process of

463
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,640
how we can replicate this

464
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,079
because it's but also it's very

465
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,880
important to document the

466
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,359
uh to have him in on board if you want

467
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,039
to replicate this to have on board also

468
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
people that know about the local

469
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,640
law context of what's happening so again

470
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
we are in arena we are just monitoring

471
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
cameras that are

472
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,559
monitoring public areas

473
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,439
that might not be lawful in whatever

474
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,679
country or city you are living so

475
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,280
we will document this so that everybody

476
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,679
can replicate it after

477
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,240
great thanks

478
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,039
hi so two questions first have you

479
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
thought about i i guess maybe i don't

480
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,640
know depends on the trust that you have

481
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,880
in government for for people to register

482
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,240
to have to register these cameras

483
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
themselves so you can get like a public

484
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,520
register that you can ask for and the

485
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,799
second thing is

486
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,120
um there's companies like ring

487
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
that make private people do this

488
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,240
right

489
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,799
are you also tracking those well ring

490
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,679
holes can i get the first question

491
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,400
so

492
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,840
uh

493
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,720
for the first question

494
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,760
uh

495
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,200
okay go go to the second one because i

496
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
want to okay so in regards to the ring

497
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,919
cameras what we really want to map is

498
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,320
just cameras that face public areas so

499
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,880
for example views of the street ring

500
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,360
cameras for example are not popular in

501
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,720
albania at all

502
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,240
we have the manual version where you

503
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,080
have to stand behind the door to see

504
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,320
who's on the other side so we haven't

505
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,480
come across that issue but

506
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,559
it's quite an interesting one but again

507
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,799
it's about the what the law says so if

508
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,120
you are if you can do it in your city or

509
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,400
country

510
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
we shouldn't monitor it because it's

511
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,240
part of the law let's say if you trust

512
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,400
your government but in our case it's not

513
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
it's very vague it's not i we don't

514
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,240
understand what you can monitor or not

515
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,760
and we're trying to raise awareness with

516
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
it so even if it's a ring camera in your

517
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,200
city

518
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,880
and it's your private property as long

519
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
as you're monitoring me passing as a

520
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,600
pedestrian outside your door

521
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,360
that shouldn't be the case because

522
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,919
that's not allowed it's also when you're

523
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,440
for instance when you have a job where

524
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,360
you have to go to like you're the the

525
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,200
newspaper boy you're 16 years old and

526
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,720
you have to go to somebody's door and

527
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
you get filmed right in whatever state

528
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,840
you are at six o'clock in the morning

529
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,880
i i could personally object to that i i

530
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
i wouldn't

531
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
bring papers to such a person if i were

532
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,679
a paper boy but

533
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,280
yeah here in the netherlands it's

534
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
actually illegal to film people in

535
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,280
public spaces i believe without their

536
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
permission

537
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
so cameras that are on public street you

538
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,679
can't you can if you have a personal

539
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,440
camera you can only

540
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
do it on your personal property so let's

541
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,280
say i have a house i want to protect

542
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,919
with a camera i can put it

543
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,440
at the front of my garden and film the

544
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,919
entire street i can only film my garden

545
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,280
and my front door

546
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
exactly but one of the problems is that

547
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
for instance if you're a 16 year old

548
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
paper boy you actually have to subject

549
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,039
yourself to this

550
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,559
without permission because you are going

551
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,640
on the person's premises you get filmed

552
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
you get sent to

553
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,240
don't know which data center and you

554
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,679
cannot approve or disapprove and the

555
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,840
same goes for people that are in there

556
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
in a official capacity

557
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,840
so people visiting your house and being

558
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
able to film that actually has

559
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,520
boundaries that are

560
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
trading on other people's rights

561
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,559
and if the door is facing the street yep

562
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,880
then then all bets are off and that's

563
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,640
why these things are very important

564
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,880
because we feel again we have the local

565
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,440
context of albania we think that digital

566
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,480
literacy is a very very low point very

567
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
low in at the worldwide level so people

568
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,480
don't what we're discussing right now

569
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,600
they don't understand that this is

570
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,400
important or whatever and that's why we

571
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,720
we we all need to do more

572
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,760
uh about explaining

573
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,080
why this is okay or it's not okay like

574
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,480
putting things into perspective just

575
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,320
like for example this shows how

576
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,159
surveilled you are at the moment

577
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,760
regarding your first question quick

578
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,960
answer uh it seems like we don't trust

579
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,280
the government uh where we live

580
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,760
uh the thing is that we just want it to

581
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
work properly that's nothing against

582
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,880
them

583
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,840
but

584
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,760
they are now introducing a law

585
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,960
that makes

586
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,720
that will put all the cameras from

587
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,760
business from businesses

588
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,200
to in one

589
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,400
directory

590
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,600
so which is basically store everything

591
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,039
so the government will have access

592
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
immediate access to all the cameras that

593
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
are which first of all is important

594
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,039
impossible technically because you need

595
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,559
the all the cameras have different

596
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,039
software and setup et cetera et cetera

597
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,480
and the second only the thought of it

598
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,400
it's like cringy right

599
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,159
but

600
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,640
and and that's that's uh that's very the

601
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,720
police should go after the bad people

602
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,880
the bad guys but we right now we have no

603
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
after all the cases that we've shown we

604
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,480
have no indication that the data are

605
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
handled properly and we had more time we

606
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
can go on and have more cases where the

607
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,039
data in albania are not handled properly

608
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,960
by government officials so it's not

609
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,799
about as i mentioned before we don't we

610
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,440
don't have anything about trusting but

611
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
we have all the indications in the world

612
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
that they either don't know what they're

613
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,720
doing or they're doing these this on

614
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,640
purpose or even worse the combination of

615
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,280
both and there's another factor on top

616
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,960
of that which is we don't have an

617
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,360
indication that the government knows

618
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,000
where these cameras are either so really

619
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,720
the only option to go forward will be to

620
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,200
crowdsource that data so we allow people

621
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,440
to submit either anonymously or with

622
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,520
their profile because we want to respect

623
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,840
their right but it seems like there is

624
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,440
no other way to have such information

625
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,640
okay thank you thank you thanks

626
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,130
then another big applause

627
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,480
[Applause]

628
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,200
thank you so much thank you

629
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,280
then the next speaker i don't know if

630
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,960
he's here his name is matthew ah there

631
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,240
you are

632
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,640
well i i came in a little late

633
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,240
because i thought it was a two was it

634
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,840
once it was like running that's why i

635
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,520
have a fork in my pocket

636
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,200
um i was eaten

637
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,679
so i asked like what is it about and i

638
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,679
didn't really understand but that

639
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,360
actually made me super excited for the

640
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,760
talk because now i have no idea yet what

641
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,320
it's about and the more i can learn

642
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,799
so i believe it's about software

643
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,120
is that correct matthew

644
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,000
yes

645
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,280
i know something

646
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
um but he's going to tell so much more

647
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
about it so give a big applause for

648
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,480
matthew and his talk

649
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,760
[Applause]

650
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,840
are you ready or should i

651
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,760

654
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,480
something up so in the meantime we're

655
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,080
going to play a little game i heard of

656
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,280
yesterday

657
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,360

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,400
with the number one and then someone

662
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,520
yells two then someone else yells three

663

674
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,799
okay one uh one last time and then we're

675
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,400
ready to go then

676
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,600
almost okay

677
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,600
one

678
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,799
okay he is ready well thank you and a

679
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,990
big applause for matthew

680
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,089
[Applause]

681
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,720
so who here has heard of docker

682
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,159
wow that's amazing i thought i was gonna

683
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,440
have to explain what docker is but you

684
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,279
all know what it is right

685
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,080
great

686
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,880
so this talk is called use flake dot nix

687
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,840
not dockerfile this is

688
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,960
i don't know if i'm preaching to the

689
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,640
choir maybe you know what the issues are

690
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,159
with building software with docker maybe

691
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,520
you don't but i'm going to try and

692
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,120
explain why it's not really that

693
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,880
reproducible and why you can use nyx

694
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,559
instead so why use dark files

695
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,520
well i don't know but why use flake.next

696
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
because build via dockerfiles aren't

697
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,679
reproducible but they are repeatable so

698
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,520
that means that you know you can run the

699
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,440
same instructions but it does not mean

700
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,480
that you'll get the same result

701
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,080
so what is nix

702
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,640
nyx is a expression language it's a

703
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,159
domain specific language which was

704
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,080
invented by el codolstra in his phd

705
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
thesis in 2003

706
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,640
and it's lazily evaluated which means

707
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,240
it's more performant for doing package

708
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
management it's a purely functional

709
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
programming language which means it's

710
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,440
not procedural so the order in which you

711
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,360
define things does not matter

712
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,039
it's declarative rather than imperative

713
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,440
so things are defined as a expression

714
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,039
rather than as

715
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,559
a sequence of events that you want to

716
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,960
occur much like in a docker file and

717
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,760
yeah

718
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,279
in that in that way everything is an

719
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,600
expression and there are no side effects

720
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,919
so here's a basic abstract example this

721
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,640
is called an attribute set uh in this

722
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,360
example x is equal to a list which has a

723
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,440
string inside of it y

724
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
uh y is equal to one and z is equal to

725
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,400
the expression one plus one

726
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
so let's evaluate what x would have been

727
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,120
so x is a string

728
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,840
y inside of a list

729
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,159
and the same for y is just one

730
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,360
and z is one plus one which is two

731
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,919
so here's a basic concrete example of me

732
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,320
compiling hello world from gnu source

733
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,400
code so i'm going to cut the examples

734
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,919
helloworld.next this is the nyx

735
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,760
expression which defines how to compile

736
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,520
the software and then i'm going to nix

737
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,279
build it i'm going to look at the result

738
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,840
that it creates the result is a sim link

739
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
to this object store called slash nick

740
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,919
slashdoor where the immutable software

741
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,000
packages live

742
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,840
right um we can see that it's a

743
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,880
dynamically linked x86 executable with

744
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
its interpreter patched to the correct

745
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,720
interpreter and then i run it at the end

746
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,799
so you see hello world is there

747
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,880
so what is the expression at the top

748
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,559
where it says let packages import next

749
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,279
packages etc so that is a function call

750
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,240
to standard m dot mk derivation

751
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,159
the first argument is name which is a

752
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,080
string so i'm going to call this package

753
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
hello world and the source code is going

754
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,520
to come from a good news ftp server and

755
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,720
we're going to hash this and this is

756
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,799
really important we're going to say what

757
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,760
the sha-256 sum is ahead of time now

758
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,080
this way if anyone else sees the

759
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,399
expression in the future and they build

760
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,720
it and that tarball has changed well

761
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,480
we'll know about it because the sha-256

762
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,320
won't match so this data is really

763
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
important for reproducibility and

764
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,480
security

765
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
so by comparison let's see what a

766
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,000
dockerfire would look like

767
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,159
so from ubuntu latest there's two

768
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,600
problems here right ubuntu

769
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
even if we could find the original

770
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,520
dockerfiles for ubuntu

771
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
could we reproduce it or do they have

772
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
many steps inside of it that aren't

773
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,840
reproducible like apt install this app

774
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
install that because every time you do

775
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,200
apt install you've lost the

776
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
reproducibility because it's going to

777
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,760
give you a different result the next

778
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,799
time it runs latest latest when when i

779
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,880
run the docker build

780
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,919
right uh so the the docker files are not

781
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,480
intrinsically attached to their to their

782
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
results so the result of a docker file

783
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,080
is basically like a binary you give that

784
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
binary to people and you may never see

785
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,679
the docker file ever again

786
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,600
right and that's not quite true for next

787
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
expressions

788
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,360
so apt-get update

789
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,399
it's going to resolve a different

790
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,760
package list

791
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,039
the next time it runs so the next time

792
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,960
we're on docker build hello might just

793
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,039
not be there so we got to run it five

794
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,039
times and then hopefully uh debian

795
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,760
servers are uh are up again rather than

796
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,559
down and yeah but that's not that's not

797
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,919
the only problem every time we do

798
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,000
apt-get install hello

799
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
it's going to create a package database

800
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,559
and this package database is going to

801
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,240
have time stamps in it there's gonna be

802
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,559
tons of reproducibility issues

803
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,200
just at every level in this dockerfile

804
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,399
and then the last offender is cmd hello

805
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,559
this assumes that the hello package

806
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,039
actually puts a binary called hello on

807
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,120
the path so maybe hello is not the name

808
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,520
maybe it's hello dash world so there's

809
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,640
nothing but assumptions in this

810
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,120
dockerfile

811
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,200
and indeed if we use this method here

812
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,120
where we save the result of building it

813
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,039
into a tarball and then we look at the

814
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,880
table the tarball's different now this

815
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,399
isn't the full story this is a bit of a

816
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,600
cheat right

817
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
as a matter of fact if you extract this

818
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,880
you'll get another tarball and inside of

819
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,640
that is a layer and a file system

820
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,039
hierarchy like you slash user slash bin

821
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,080
etc

822
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,919
so um we'd have to inspect that with

823
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,600
difficult to understand the true reason

824
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,840
that this is not reproducible but i mean

825
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,799
this this

826
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,399
is a nice example because it shows that

827
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,159
you know even when they package the

828
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,720
tarball for the oci image this tarball

829
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,399
this image that we're gonna load into

830
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,720
docker even that step is not necessarily

831
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,279
reproducible because tarballs pack and

832
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,480
unpack

833
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
serialize and deserialize in a different

834
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,840
order every time

835
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,080
operations are performed

836
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,840
so how do we do this with a knicks flake

837
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,360
instead

838
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,880
so there's a function someone made

839
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
called i didn't i only wrote this

840
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,840
presentation this morning so i missed

841
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,720
that out but it's called um docker tools

842
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,880
build layered image

843
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,279
right so someone in nick's packages

844
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,720
which is a

845
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,880
as a library of eighty thousand software

846
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,320
packages and nix expressions and

847
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,880
functions and things um so they made

848
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,039
this this function called build layered

849
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,960
image and this is essentially a

850
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
reproducible bash script for producing

851
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,799
container images

852
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,679
right

853
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,320
so my container image equals running

854
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,559
that function with the first argument

855
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,840
name my container image the tag

856
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,240
uh latest

857
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
contents is a list of things that i want

858
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
to be in the container

859
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,039
and config.cmd is the entry point that

860
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,480
we saw in the dockerfile earlier which

861
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,120
was hello so let's just have a look here

862
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,600
so this hello here

863
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,919
that's what we're going to map to

864
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,679
in the next expression

865
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,600
config.command equals hello so this is

866
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,640
the first thing it's going to run when

867
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,880
the container boots

868
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,720
so uh this is in a data structure called

869
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,960
a flake so a flake has inputs and

870
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,159
outputs

871
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,159
we say

872
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:16,720
inputs.nextpackages.url equals this

873
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,399
github repo

874
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,320
and whenever we run a nyx command on

875
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,519
this it's actually going to generate a

876
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,360
flake.lock

877
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,679
so i'd just like to show you that

878
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,880
before

879
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,480
i get too far in so flake.lock

880
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,919
so we no longer have that problem of

881
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,600
like latest being latest whenever on the

882
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,559
command

883
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,480
because it creates a lock file and tells

884
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,320
you what it was when i run the command

885
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,919
and this is immutable and stored in the

886
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,279
git repo where i provide these

887
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,440
expressions or tell you to run it from

888
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,480
so

889
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
yeah let's uh let's build it so we're

890
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,080
going to build my container image we're

891
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,360
going to look in the result and we're

892
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,720
going to load that result into docker

893
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,440
and then we're going to run it with

894
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,039
docker and this has all been done like

895
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,399
the container image has been built with

896
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,159
nex reproducibly

897
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,440
and then ran with docker

898
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,399
so i'm just going to run that

899
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,720
oh dear ah there we go

900
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,480
i got scott scared there for a moment

901
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,880
okay so it created a result put it in

902
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,720
the nick store where it lives uh

903
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,039
reproducibly and it loaded it into

904
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,799
docker and then it run it

905
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,480
so there you go much more reproducible

906
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
than the docker file right

907
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,880
so why is this the case so docker is

908
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,039
repeatable but not reproducible defined

909
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,039
instructions but it trusts the internet

910
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,720
unconditionally and it doesn't perform

911
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,919
any hashing or at least doesn't

912
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,760
encourage people to do that

913
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,440
doc files do not provide you with a tool

914
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,960
set for performing reproducible builds

915
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,240
and nyx is

916
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,320
basically a

917
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,559
c plus plus binary written by alcodultra

918
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,000
which implements the nyx expression

919
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,480
language which gives you a tool set for

920
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,720
implementing reproducible builds

921
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,640
so what does nix guarantee

922
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,159
so it guarantees that we're going to get

923
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,760
the same input from the internet every

924
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,640
time

925
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,919
and we're going to perform the build

926
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,559
process inside of a sandbox and

927
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,200
hopefully the result is deterministic

928
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
uh it guarantees that but it does not

929
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,360
guarantee that the build process in fact

930
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,880
is deterministic an example of this

931
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,200
would be the java compiler the java

932
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,600
compiler will put timestamps into every

933
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,519
jar file that creates every piece of

934
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,840
java source code now of course we're not

935
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,679
going to get rid of the system call

936
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,679
that allows the process to gather the

937
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,880
time at this point in time and but

938
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
that was that was a decision because it

939
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,760
built

940
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,919
sorry it um it broke a lot of build

941
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,559
processes so

942
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,640
instead we have to do things like touch

943
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,720
1970 at every build step so that we get

944
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,159
rid of the time stamp and the

945
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,679
intermediate steps when we compile

946
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,559
things

947
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,840
um

948
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,519
so yeah there's lots of reasons that a

949
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,360
build may not be deterministic and nyx

950
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,919
can't help with that what i can do is

951
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,279
perform the same build with the same

952
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,120
input every single time and hope that

953
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,559
the output's deterministic which is a

954
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,519
lot more than many other tools can do

955
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,440
so do i have any extra time

956
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,820
do i have uh

957
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:05,229
[Applause]

958
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,440
yes yes we have enough time for

959
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,280
questions oh wait i didn't want to go

960
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,399
with the questions straight away i just

961
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,000
wanted to show uh three really cool

962
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,159
things so nick's shell

963
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,000
is a way of trying things before you buy

964
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,440
so i'm going to ssh into my server

965
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,719
because the internet here might just

966
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,679
drop out um so i'm going to next build

967
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,839
oh sorry next shell

968
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,560
next package is hashtag i don't know

969
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,480
python3

970
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,839
and the reason i'm going to do that is

971
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,000
because i have python 3 now

972
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
but if i get out of the python 3

973
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,079
interpreter and try and run python 3

974
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,359
again after exiting out of this

975
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,159
temporary shell i don't have python 3.

976
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,918
i don't have python on any of my systems

977
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,159
installed globally right it's just i

978
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,679
install it when i need it and only when

979
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,679
it's necessary now because it's an

980
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,879
expression language if i go into the

981
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,239
reply

982
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,320
i can say something like let's load next

983
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,719
packages

984
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,800
and then python3 has a member function

985
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,839
inside of it

986
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,280
with packages

987
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,960
and i can say

988
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,000
inside of p put all of the whatever it

989
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,240
is 20 000 python libraries that exist in

990
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,800
the world from pi pi

991
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
and

992
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,000
i'm going to give it a list of python

993
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,839
libraries that i want for this

994
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,280
particular instance of python p dot i

995
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
don't know numpy

996
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
it's going to evaluate that and create a

997
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,400
derivation and then i'm going to build

998
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,119
that derivation

999
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,240
and it's going to do all of this

1000
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,680
reproducibly so if you you know

1001
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,280
evaluated this expression you get the

1002
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,960
same path you get the same output path

1003
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,839
on your machine and then i can ls in

1004
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,000
there and see that we've got bin and

1005
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,960
we've got python interpreter

1006
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,320
and if we run that

1007
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,839
we'll have a python 3 that can import

1008
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,880
numpy

1009
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,599
oh

1010
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,520
but if i exit this

1011
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,599
and exit again

1012
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,320
you know i don't have python anymore

1013
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,599
i've gone to a next wrap and say i want

1014
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,280
python three

1015
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,839
got a load next packages

1016
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,040
i'm going to build python three

1017
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,280
notes that i'm not defining a function i

1018
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,400
just want python three i don't want

1019
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,560
python three with numpy

1020
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,599
let's take a look in the output

1021
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,800
this python cannot impose numpy because

1022
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
there is no such thing it's not global

1023
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,160
there is no global state there's no

1024
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
global thing that's being modified

1025
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,079
everything is copy every single time

1026
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,359
with something gathered or without

1027
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,560
something added

1028
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,520
um

1029
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,680
another thing that you can do is you can

1030
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,839
cross compile using nex

1031
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,920
so in next packages there is a package

1032
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,320
set called packages cross which is all

1033
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,839
of the 80 000 nick packages that you can

1034
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,160
get um oops

1035
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,359
yeah so like i don't know

1036
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,200
python's there

1037
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,640
we've got um

1038
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,920
numpy

1039
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,119
and we've got

1040
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,400
um

1041
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,160
firefox

1042
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,800
and we've got you know a set of 80 000

1043
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,240
packages which we can do what we want

1044
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,480
with so what do we want to cross compile

1045
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,160
all those 8000 packages well packages

1046
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,800
cross has in it if we tab complete

1047
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,720
all of the architectures we want so

1048
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,640
let's say risk five

1049
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,079
64 bit

1050
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,359
and then

1051
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,280
i don't know hello world

1052
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,640
now i think i've done this and this is

1053
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,320
another benefit of reproducible builders

1054
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,000
that things are cached i did this last

1055
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,599
month it puts something in my slash nick

1056
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,200
slash door it's still there it's not

1057
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
going away i haven't garbage collected

1058
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,480
it yet and that's another concept that

1059
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,079
knicks has his garbage collection the

1060
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,599
file system is memory is what they call

1061
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,720
it in the thesis so um i i did this last

1062
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,160
month so it's still there so that's why

1063
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,839
i completed but if i want to rebuild it

1064
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,920
just to show off it can do this and this

1065
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,480
is reproducibly cross-compiling hello

1066
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,440
world for risk five 64-bit and it's done

1067
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,760
and in slash bin we have a

1068
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,480
dynamically linked wrist 5 binary

1069
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,079
and the fun part is despite the fact

1070
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,680
that i'm actually running on an x86

1071
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,440
kernel i can still

1072
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,960
i can still actually execute this

1073
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
because i have something called bin fmt

1074
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,160
registrations

1075
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,240
enabled on my system and the way that

1076
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,960
that's done is also very easy

1077
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,880
thanks to nyx

1078
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
because nixos of course has many options

1079
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,400
and i can just say okay

1080
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,640
i've been fmt registrations yeah i want

1081
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,560
to be able to run um

1082
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,040
windows binaries or arm binaries i can

1083
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,280
do that on my x86 system just by

1084
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,720
putting a list of emulated systems in

1085
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,800
this option so that that should um

1086
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,200
convince you to use nexus xos if nothing

1087
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
else does

1088
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,240
um

1089
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,920
yeah i think i just showed off those

1090
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,680
three points so any questions if i have

1091
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,520
time if not and that's my talk

1092
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,240
yeah if there are any questions

1093
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,839
the mics are still in the

1094
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,560
middle

1095
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
uh if you walk the mic otherwise the

1096
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,000
video doesn't have audio so we all can

1097
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,359
hear you but the people re-watching

1098
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,680
can't

1099
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,520
well in docker file you have like that's

1100
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,040
a little bit closer to the mic please

1101
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,599
yeah thank you docker files you have

1102
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,440
latest and that's great you don't have

1103
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,520
to upgrade it

1104
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,280
in half a year

1105
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,040
is there something like nyx maybe

1106
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,280
specifiable latest up to this timestamp

1107
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
uh yeah so i mean docker could if it

1108
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,359
wanted to probably like implement a lock

1109
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,040
file um

1110
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,800
although i i haven't seen that so so the

1111
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,880
benefit of nyx here right is that you

1112
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,400
can't do such a thing as latest it

1113
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,079
doesn't exist and that's a good thing

1114
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,320
for reproducibility so we take a look at

1115
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,440
this docker file right it says latest

1116
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,040
now there's no there's no when you run

1117
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,240
the command it's going to go and fetch

1118
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,480
the latest and everyone that runs the

1119
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,240
docker bill command every single person

1120
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,079
on the planet will get a very different

1121
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,040
result

1122
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,720
right there is no guarantee so i have to

1123
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,880
target i have to say like 2004 right but

1124
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
that 2004 could still change technically

1125
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,480
if i wanted to be really reproducible

1126
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,560
and docker does do this you can specify

1127
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,839
a hash

1128
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,359
right and so so you know there is a way

1129
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,359
around that but it's the it's the least

1130
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,800
of docker's issues

1131
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,640
right so this is just one

1132
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,440
no

1133
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,280
well the question would be is there a

1134
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,800
next upgrade

1135
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,560
uh yes indeed so let's say flake.lock

1136
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,160
flake.next here has um nexos 20 of 2205

1137
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,319
this is a tag right so it changes

1138
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,319
so if i want to see what that is i go

1139
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,920
into the flake.lock and we see that

1140
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,359
indeed it's the

1141
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,839
e3583

1142
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,680
revision of nyx packages oops

1143
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,839
and if i go to the next packages

1144
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,119
on github

1145
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,280
and i go to that

1146
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,839
a hush

1147
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,839
what i'm saying it's a lot of steps to

1148
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,839
keep your system up to date

1149
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,359
no it's not i'm just showing you the

1150
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,119
full path as to how it's reproducible so

1151
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,880
we go to that commit

1152
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,400
we'll see that that commit exists and

1153
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
this commit was made a few days ago you

1154
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,960
know four days ago so in four days you

1155
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,640
know a lot might have happened so we

1156
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,079
want to go on and we want to advance

1157
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,160
from this hash this revision here

1158
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,000
so all we have to do is next click

1159
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,119
update

1160
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,480
and it will go and find what the latest

1161
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,920
hash is looks like d1ca for ea right and

1162
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,839
so this is the step that you do to

1163
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,359
update the log file

1164
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,760
um and once that's done

1165
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,280
right now it's extra it actually went

1166
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,640
and fetched the latest mixed packages

1167
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,160
and it's extracting guitar ball on my

1168
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,839
laptop so it's a bit slow because my

1169
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,640
laptop disc is a bit slow but um but

1170
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,960
that lock file will be uh updated that

1171
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,119
was great yeah okay i think we need to

1172
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,560
be rounding up the questions do we have

1173
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,480
time for one more

1174
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,920
or should we

1175
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,680
and we've got one more speaker so if you

1176
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,280
the other questions i think they can

1177
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
approach you yeah afterwards because we

1178
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,960
really gotta

1179
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,680
move it along sorry yeah thank you so

1180
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,280
much question but in one sentence if you

1181
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,680
go to reapology.org you will find of all

1182
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,280
the distros on the planet all their

1183
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,720
versions and you'll find that nyx

1184
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,880
packages has the most recent of any

1185
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,680
distro beats the pants of anything top

1186
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,440
right next package is unstable it's the

1187
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,319
most

1188
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,480
fresh it's the largest size so it's got

1189
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,319
more packages than arch they're fresher

1190
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,440
than art they're more up to date than

1191
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,119
arch they're more maintained than a lot

1192
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,119
of other distributions too

1193
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,359

um i learned what a subject was and i

1197
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,920
was like i know nothing about that

1198
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,599
because his uh his speech or talk is on

1210
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,720
minutes ago

1211
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,319
so i'll just make it up completely oh

1212
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,520
there's no time as well so you'll just

1213
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,280
have to flag me because

1214
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,560
to keep track of the time i don't know

1215
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,960
where to start but i will start when i

1216
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,560
will start from the point when i went

1217
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,560
over to the retro tent

1218
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,680
and

1219
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,119
uh

1220
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,720
i was with some people and they asked me

1221
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,359
about uh the machines there and some

1222
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,720
where i was i was familiar with uh the

1223
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,560
in particular the amiga the commodore

1224
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,119
amiga computer

1225
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,960
and uh it took me back to when uh well i

1226
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,040
suppose i lived through the 80s but not

1227
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,680
the 70s i missed the 70s

1228
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,640
and

1229
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,839
the

1230
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,640
uh my my first computer was a green

1231
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,960
monitor computer uh 8-bit commodore pet

1232
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,599
and then my family got an amstrad cpc

1233
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,599
that had color and i could load games i

1234
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,079
think my friends had games from cassette

1235
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,119
and

1236
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,119
after which then my third computer was

1237
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,040
the amiga 500 and i

1238
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,800
absolutely loved it and it could do

1239
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,359
things that you just could not do on uh

1240
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,440
on other systems at the time

1241
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,319
so

1242
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,119
uh

1243
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,240
they

1244
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,440
even basic concepts like what um how how

1245
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,839
would it connect to the internet uh i'd

1246
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,920
where would the internet run if i if i

1247
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,280
booted it up and tried to use the

1248
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,640
internet what did the internet look like

1249
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,599
back then

1250
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,839
well i don't know i wasn't on it but i

1251
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,480
read articles in magazines and the way

1252
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,240
we got software for the computer was

1253
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,319
just simply we could buy magazines or we

1254
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,800
could wait until we saved enough to uh

1255
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,319
go and go

1256
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,520
buy buy some software from the

1257
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,599
smiths or wherever the wherever the

1258
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,599
sales were at the time or even mail

1259
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,520
order and one popular thing we used to

1260
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,240
do was order software from uh

1261
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,400
uh magazines where they would list like

1262
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,280
one pound per disk or uh yeah or

1263
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
alternatives as well

1264
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,720
um so

1265
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,880
yeah before we had the internet before a

1266
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,920
lot of my friends got uh uh maybe a

1267
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,599
computer with windows

1268
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,599
um in in

1269
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,079
in the mid 90s uh people still had

1270
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,000
modems and they could dial up into uh

1271
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,280
they could they could dial other

1272
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,760
machines that also had a modem on the

1273
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
phone line so

1274
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,960
you couldn't

1275
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,880
tell the computer were to go and the

1276
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,520
computer would be able to automatically

1277
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,400
route its way to its destination you had

1278
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,160
to manually dial the number and uh

1279
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,000
and download packages off

1280
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,720
or files and you had the limitations of

1281
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,560
the size of the floppy disk so you had

1282
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,119
to split if maybe your form your disk

1283
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,720
format wasn't big enough to contain the

1284
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,480
file you had to split it up into into

1285
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,920
pieces um and just out of interest how

1286
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,720
many of you had an 8-bit micro back in

1287
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,560
the day

1288
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,400
though no one no one had an 8-bit micro

1289
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,960
back in the day uh 16-bit

1290
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,280
micro uh

1291
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,200
early games console no

1292
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,000
so

1293
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,800
yeah

1294
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,880
what's that

1295
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,359
msx basic excellent nice

1296
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,960
uh someone else shouted

1297
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,079
yeah i'd say earlier yeah

1298
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,160
the the the the earliest yeah so um

1299
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
yeah it was it was interesting times and

1300
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,599
i think a lot of things were taken for

1301
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,960
granted like how long things took but

1302
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,000
um

1303
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,640
i i when i look back now and i see the

1304
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,880
machines in the in the retro tent a lot

1305
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,720
of them have been upgraded they have sd

1306
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,839
cards

1307
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,200
so you can load almost any package from

1308
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,920
that ever existed is on that one sd card

1309
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,319
because it's scaled up it's been scaled

1310
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,240
up so vastly

1311
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,839
and the packages are now tiny in

1312
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,520
comparison

1313
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,839
and

1314
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,960
um it

1315
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,119
it really put things into perspective

1316
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,200
i'd occasionally i look back and i'll

1317
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,760
run an emulator and i'll

1318
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,200
um

1319
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,240
i'll

1320
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,480
i'll forget how difficult things were

1321
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,640
and tricky and i'll

1322
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,000
i'll forget um i might forget oh it

1323
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,079
really did take that long oh it didn't

1324
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,280
seem you know

1325
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,200
i mean it wasn't such a big deal putting

1326
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,599
a cassette loading your game in from

1327
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,040
cassette or floppy disk but yeah it

1328
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,880
we've got it really cushy these days

1329
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,119
we've got a really easy we don't realize

1330
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,680
how convenient convenient it is to have

1331
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,599
the facilities we've got on disk i

1332
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,839
didn't have it this hard disk drive so a

1333
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,319
lot of things ran off rom or from from

1334
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,599
floppy disk

1335
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,280
um

1336
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,000
but uh yeah it was uh it was good memory

1337
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,640
trip uh i it must be still up i don't

1338
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,839
know if they're dismantling it yeah

1339
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,079
it'll be still up retro tents so yeah

1340
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:22,960
give a

1341
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,480
have a good look at all the machines on

1342
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,800
in that retro tent and uh yeah ask

1343
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,480
around there's going to be some some

1344
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,200
guys that had old systems that love to

1345
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
talk about those things uh that just

1346
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,760
enjoyed them as much as i did uh got me

1347
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,520
interested i was interested from just a

1348
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,440
hobbyist perspective because i liked

1349
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,960
calculators and i thought and they were

1350
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,280
very simple devices

1351
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,760
a bit more than a glorified calculator

1352
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,319
but less than a

1353
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,119
3d graphics rendering engine so

1354
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,160
playstations came out in 95 ish

1355
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,520
something like that is that right like

1356
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,800
no it was earlier than that i think it

1357
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,480
was 92-93

1358
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,800
uh yeah it all just went to uh pc so

1359
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,319
yeah definitely definitely check out the

1360
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,440
retro tent um yeah good times for me and

1361
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,670
yeah have fun

1362
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:12,480
[Applause]

1363
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,520
it works

1364
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,440
well thank you i learned a lot because i

1365
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,599
wasn't there

1366
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,280
and it's really really

1367
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,960
it surprised me my dad talks about it

1368
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,119
sometimes it's still oh there goes my

1369
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,079
fork it still surprises me how far we've

1370
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,880
come in such a short time like 20 years

1371
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,760
ago

1372
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,200
and now it's

1373
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,040
i yesterday i walked through an entire

1374
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,559
different world while shooting robots

1375
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,040
and 20 years ago my dad was like loading

1376
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,760
a file and it would take an hour

1377
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,760
so it's amazing and you talk about it

1378
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,319
really lovely now uh there's a question

1379
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,280
so uh

1380
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,720
fired on

1381
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,280
yeah that was cool do you still have

1382
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,839
like cassettes or floppies

1383
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,480
um yeah we had an m6 basics and it

1384
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,359
loaded things off cassettes and i

1385
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,839
remember having to reload games because

1386
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,520
the cassette would be a bit stuck have

1387
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,599
you had any issues with that too do you

1388
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,920
remember anything that's right uh that

1389
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,079
that did happen some of the reason well

1390
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,680
one of the one of the common reasons for

1391
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,880
that or there's a few could be that the

1392
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,079
tape head i

1393
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,839
have experienced it the tape head can

1394
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,119
become clogged over time i what i you

1395
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,800
get these cassettes that are cleaner

1396
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,119
head cassette tapes but

1397
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,319
i would just simply get some get some

1398
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,640
get a little drop of isopropyl alcohol

1399
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,040
on a q-tip and just rub the head and

1400
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,720
that's that that that cleans it up

1401
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,640
nicely it dries out quickly so if you

1402
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,319
just want a quick fix to that that's one

1403
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,680
try another try is well a slightly

1404
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,079
trickier one is the head alignment there

1405
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,559
is a screw and you can get calibration

1406
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,640
tapes where you can align the head and

1407
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,319
you need to maybe i don't know you need

1408
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,480
an oscilloscope i don't yeah so you'd

1409
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,200
need to have a way of um about yeah

1410
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,720
balancing that head so that there's a

1411
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,800
few a few ways and then you should might

1412
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
even be able to load the tapes in and

1413
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,720
archive some if they don't exist on the

1414
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,880
internet you might be able to contribute

1415
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,200
to the archive

1416
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,839
you might have some rare tapes yeah yeah

1417
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,000
okay the the last question for now and

1418
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,240
then i assume they can uh

1419
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,200
any other

1420
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,880
things yeah it's not a question just

1421
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,520
wanted to mention my my story about this

1422
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,000
so uh yeah it's a question actually so

1423
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,400
have you did you also exchange cassettes

1424
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
with your like game boy cassettes or

1425
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
even console cassettes because

1426
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,720
i was living in a block apartment and we

1427
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,559
were because we couldn't afford each one

1428
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,160
of us like we were 10 friends we

1429
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,760
couldn't afford each one of us to buy

1430
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,079
all the cassettes we wanted so one month

1431
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,400
one of us buy one and we exchanged it

1432
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,400
and it was also a game like you you were

1433
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
very good if you finished the game first

1434
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,160
and you could go and in your face

1435
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,280
everyone

1436
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,040
uh yeah yeah

1437
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,839
so

1438
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,359
this one the first card and the second i

1439
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,800
want to say is that i have a story with

1440
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,400
my dad

1441
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,920
he came i remember this very clearly he

1442
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,119
came in my in i was playing

1443
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,319
a game

1444
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,920
and actually what happened is that he

1445
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,040
said did you do your homework i said yes

1446
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,800
i said did you clean up your room said

1447
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,040
yes so your mom wanted help did you i

1448
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,480
said yes i did it

1449
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,920
okay now go out because i want to play

1450
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,119
i'm your father

1451
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,640
so

1452
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,240
he would run out of excuses just want to

1453
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,440
share because

1454
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,160
yeah

1455
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,079
yeah all these all these good old very

1456
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,000
yeah thanks for that yeah well we we did

1457
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,079
um we did share some uh discs that were

1458
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,319
um a lot of the time you get three games

1459
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,240
off the magazines maybe we couldn't even

1460
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
buy the game so we'd all get the cover

1461
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,559
discs and the cover discs

1462
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,079
sometimes they'd have a full game

1463
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,839
sometimes they had pd games sometimes

1464
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,520
they'd have different types of games and

1465
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,640
some friends if they were lucky enough

1466
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,240
to have modems i didn't actually have a

1467
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,480
cassette player but my friends did i had

1468
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,319
i was i was uh

1469
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,119
spoiled i had a disc drive

1470
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,720
so

1471
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,480
but but even the disk drives as well

1472
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,800
people would if they were lucky as well

1473
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,720
to have a modem which i didn't have they

1474
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,319
could get onto the bulletin boards and

1475
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,880
get software from them and yeah

1476
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,200
well you mentioned that is

1477
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,160
everything you mentioned that is

1478
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,240
everything was slow but i think doing

1479
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,079
these exchanges was a very nice way of

1480
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,480
socializing and getting new friends and

1481
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,240
it was like a social network

1482
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,559
yeah oh they would leave their name in

1483
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,559
the in the in the intro yes and it would

1484
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,319
a scroller a text scroller and it will

1485
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,079
put there put that on yeah that's good

1486
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,920
that's amazing i loved hearing the

1487
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,680
stories and it's so funny because i

1488
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,520
remember when i was a little smaller

1489
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,440
that we had a wii and obviously that's

1490
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,400
way more advanced but we had to like

1491
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,319
this thing got stuck and then you had to

1492
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,680
take it out and um blow on the cd to
