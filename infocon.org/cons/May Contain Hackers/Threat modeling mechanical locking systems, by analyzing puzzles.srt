[Music]

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,080
uh thank you all for being here my name

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
is juan lila marcus

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,640
and what i want to talk about is thread

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,439
modeling mechanical unlocking systems by

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,720
analyzing puzzles

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,800
so what i want to

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,239
talk is this is a security awareness

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,920
but a different different type because

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,360
whenever

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
there's security awareness we see

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
billboards like these

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,719
it says

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,079
already this year 19 burglaries and

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
please prevent burglaries if you see

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
something call us etc

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
but for me that's

18
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,719
not really the point like you can give a

19
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,760
lot of advice like keep your lights on

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,280
or

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
um or don't leave your your favorables

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,200
laying around uh but but there's more to

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
it

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,040
let's go into it

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
so first off can we prevent burglaries

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,240
i would say no

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,880
but we can make it a lot harder

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,040
then there is a lot of arguments about

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,320
bricks and lions the one is why should i

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,439
buy good locks if someone can break

31
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,119
a window with a rock

32
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,159
that's totally fair

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
as for lions

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
people always say

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,720
i don't need to outrun

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,399
i don't need to outrun a lion i just

37
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,360
need to outrun the persons with me

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,079
i i think that's fair but it's still not

39
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,799
very nice

40
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,479
um so i'm going to try a different way

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,680
so first

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
why puzzles

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
first they are fun

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,040
i have a few here i have a few at the

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,920
lockpicking village

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,399
and examples are

47
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,520
there are plenty of them um i i have a

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,480
small collection i do a lot of

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,440
very

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,040
hard

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,920
sudokus with the guys from

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,840
cracking the cryptic where i solve those

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
puzzles

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,080
often but the foremost reason is that

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,840
nobody cares

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,720
so whenever i talk about

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
security topics

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,440
then it's always people have opinions

59
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,599
about it and when i talk about puzzles

60
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,560
then

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
nobody cares

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,879
and that's very nice

63
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
so one

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,840
thing about tool

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,560
we

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,760
the open organization uh of lock pickers

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
it exists here in the netherlands um it

68
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,159
exists in the united states united

69
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,400
kingdom and in australia

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
here in the netherlands we have weekly

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,440
lock-picking sessions

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
and if you want to learn more about the

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,400
topics i'm sharing here

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
then please consider

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,440
visiting us at our lockpicking village

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,239
it's just right next door

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,720
on this field

78
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,080
so let's go into threat modeling

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,200
this is a simplified version

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,920
uh it will just take a lot longer but it

81
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,440
will get you started

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,879
so before we start uh start to thread

83
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,760
model we want to find our about what is

84
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,239
an asset what's an attacker what our

85
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,799
vulnerabilities let's just be clear on

86
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,640
the on the definitions or at least the

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,959
definitions i will be using

88
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,959
during this

89
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
during this presentation

90
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
because if we

91
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,360
use different definitions if i say

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
threats and you mean you think on

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,120
on a vulnerability or risk

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,159
then

95
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,400
we're thinking about different things

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,239
and it's going to be confusing

97
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,159
so for the asset

98
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,360
that's the thing of value

99
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,440
this is either a valuable to the

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,160
defender or valuable to

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
the attacker because

102
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
if the asset is not valuable to the

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,120
attacker

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,440
then of course your system

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,040
will not be

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
touched

107
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,160
and this can be anything from from

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
information or money what i've also seen

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
on this camp

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,919
data being locked up i've seen toilet

111
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,720
paper being locked up just whatever is

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720
your whatever is your your system

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
for the threat or for the attacker

114
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
i would define it as an entity that is

115
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,040
skilled enough

116
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,720
to gain access to the assets

117
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
the attacker needs a motivation

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
opportunity and a method and if it

119
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,479
either

120
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,479
lacks one of them

121
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,960
then you don't have an attacker for your

122
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,720
system

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
i define it as skilled enough

124
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,520
because also if the attacker is not

125
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,440
skilled enough then again for your

126
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
system you don't have

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,199
an attacker

128
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,720
it's not necessarily the intent but the

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
achieving of

130
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
for the vulnerability

131
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
we define it as an unintentional flaw in

132
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,600
a system

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,240
that leads to a compromise of an asset

134
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
and these vulnerabilities can be

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,000
exploited

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,880
by

137
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,759
by an attacker

138
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,400
okay let's take a look at a few case

139
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,160
studies

140
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,800
here i have a box box of wood

141
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,919
it works like a mechanical combination

142
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,039
lock

143
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,199
so in this case it has sliders it's a

144
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,560
puzzle

145
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,160
and if you uh move the sliders past

146
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
these notches then the the the lock will

147
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,520
open the box will open

148
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
and for this because it's a puzzle

149
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,680
it's intended to be

150
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,199
carefully handled this is

151
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
created to be

152
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,199
to not use damage

153
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,479
however for for this model

154
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,440
i found that someone else was before me

155
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,080
and they just ripped the the pieces

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
apart

157
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,000
that's a different different model and

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,720
what i found for for this particular box

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,199
it has a congratulations message

160
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,639
and it also

161
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,560
assumes that you didn't use a soul

162
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,280
did brute forcing

163
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,120
did damaging its fit model

164
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,080
i don't really know

165
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,759
the second one

166
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,639
is

167
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,400
this puzzle

168
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
it's a

169
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,240
doo ring

170
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,120
it's a hidden mace puzzle

171
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,840
and there are several type of types of

172
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
them they started around the 1990s and

173
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,520
and this should have been become the the

174
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,160
best thing ever after rubik's cube but

175
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,120
it never became that big and the goal is

176
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,599
to remove the ring from the from the

177
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,680
puzzle

178
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
and it's uh it's it's quite a fun uh fun

179
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
puzzle

180
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,919
this is the orange version and as we see

181
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,840
on the box we have the we have the

182
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
instructions

183
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
and we also have

184
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
different levels

185
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,520
so there is the easy yellow up till the

186
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,160
terrible black

187
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
because i only had the orange one i

188
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
assumed the

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
um

190
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,520
the the black one would be definitely be

191
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
a lot harder

192
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,599
but a few people in the know

193
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,520
told me now it's just all psychological

194
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,280
warfare to some extent

195
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,319
so that's so that's nice

196
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,560
but at the moment i don't have access to

197
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
to any of the other ones

198
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
i can only find the yellow and the

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
orange ones for for sale so if anyone

200
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,039
has the the green blue red and black i'd

201
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,880
like to be an attacker i'd like to have

202
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,838
the opportunity to defeat them as well

203
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,320
so i mentioned

204
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,760
for this puzzle

205
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,200
uh the intended solution or the intended

206
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,040
way of of manipulating them

207
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,120
but we can list

208
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,680
the possible attacks

209
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
and here's just just a very short list

210
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
i separated them to to solving the mace

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,920
in different ways using brute force or

212
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,480
just trying out all the combinations

213
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
building a

214
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,320
a robot just like we we manipulate safes

215
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
at some point

216
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,760
but we can also learn the maze some

217
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,040
other way

218
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,680
maybe someone else already published

219
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
this on the internet

220
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
or i can just find someone that knows

221
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,920
the answer

222
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
or i can use more advanced techniques

223
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,360
like

224
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,200
getting an echo or an x-ray mate

225
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
these seem quite far-fetched like an

226
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,320
x-ray why would you solve a puzzle like

227
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
an x-ray

228
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,480
well that all depends on the on the

229
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,360
asset is the asset valuable enough for

230
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,519
the attacker

231
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,360
and

232
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,920
so i like to list them and then cross

233
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,640
them off if they're not applicable

234
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
to my

235
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
thread model

236
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
but we can also bypass

237
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,079
the safe

238
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,920
by just filing away the the knob or just

239
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,399
using a lot of force and just

240
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,440
for letting the maze free

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,640
that's all something to to consider

242
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,200
uh just for fun i tried it uh this way

243
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
so i taped a piece of

244
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,760
piece of paper around the cylinder

245
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,440
build a contraption

246
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,720
and

247
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,200
just solve the mace

248
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,880
and it drew out the maze very nicely and

249
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,200
i solved the puzzle

250
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
in the end

251
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
so i did solve it a few times beforehand

252
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,800
but now i have the

253
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,839
the

254
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
real mace as it is inside

255
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,279
so let's talk about

256
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,839
logs for now

257
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,680
because

258
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,800
puzzles are interesting

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
logs are more interesting for for me

260
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,640
logs are puzzles for tool locks are

261
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,640
puzzles

262
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,320
and the question always arises can any

263
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
lock be picked and is lock picking

264
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,000
realistic

265
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,120
i think it's an interesting question

266
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
and

267
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,279
i think if you buy

268
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,760
tens of a lock

269
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,160
if you take them apart

270
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,480
if you study the same log for

271
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,800
tens of hours hundreds of hours

272
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,760
thousands of hours

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,240
then put the lock back together very

274
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,120
carefully and start manipulating it it

275
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,279
might be possible that you

276
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,720
open this one particular lock

277
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,600
but that's for me because it's a puzzle

278
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,399
that's for me the form of realism that's

279
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,880
not the same as if this lock was on the

280
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,920
door

281
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,279
or

282
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,079
being used

283
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,279
for this i use the

284
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,160
the

285
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
thread model of

286
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
of a lockpicker

287
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
and what it wants it wants to

288
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,519
open the padlock open the shackle call

289
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,880
it open

290
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,160
but more precise it wants to rotate the

291
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,200
the cylinder without using without using

292
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,639
the key

293
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,639
and what the lockpicker has or at least

294
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
in this model

295
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,880
the lockpicker has lockpicks

296
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,800
and infinite time and infinite patience

297
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
so if this is the type of attacker you

298
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,519
want to keep out

299
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,440
then maybe you need to

300
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
do other things

301
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,720
you you need to

302
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,440
consider this

303
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,700
another thing the the lockpicker has is

304
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,920
[Music]

305
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,040
is these rules ethics so only pick your

306
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,240
own logs and only pick locks that are

307
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,279
not in use

308
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
the ctf people they have some nice nice

309
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,600
idea about

310
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,760
about this they made a contraption of 3d

311
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,320
printed plastic and it has a sliding bit

312
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
which has the

313
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
ctf flag

314
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,240
so you can prove that you've picked it

315
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
at that moment the asset becomes

316
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,440
the ctf flag

317
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,600
but then the lock is in use so are we

318
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,240
allowed to pick it

319
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,000
so for the lock

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
uh we have here a basic euro cylinder i

321
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,880
just no name

322
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,320
no no brands and nothing special

323
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,440
and in here there are a bunch of pin

324
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,519
stacks

325
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,120
just to go over it quite quite briefly

326
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,000
we can use a normal we can use the key

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,120
to set

328
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,680
all the pins to the to the red line we

329
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,000
call this a share line and this allows

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,199
the lock to

331
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,320
rotate

332
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,980
but the wrong key will not allow

333
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,240
[Music]

334
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,720
the wrong key will not allow the lock

335
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,760
to rotate we can also use lock picks

336
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,560
like these and go through the lock pin

337
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
by pin

338
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,680
find the binding pin

339
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,040
get feedback this way and open the lock

340
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,360
that of course takes

341
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,959
a lot of practice

342
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,839
and also a lot of

343
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,079
time but it is a nice

344
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,079
challenge

345
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,440
what's even more of a challenge is when

346
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
logs start having these

347
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
security pins

348
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,360
there are different shapes different

349
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
feedback a different puzzle

350
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,240
there are a few few more of them

351
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,639
for some lock pickers

352
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,360
they think normal locks are boring so

353
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,160
they start creating their own and we

354
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,480
call them challenge locks

355
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,360
so here are a few pins the first two

356
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
from the left are our normal pins

357
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,040
and the other ones are

358
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,040
are created by lock pickers themselves

359
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,240
this this one in particular is

360
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,240
from a community built lock

361
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,519
it has

362
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,440
10 10 pins

363
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,959
and two sides

364
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,680
but what's very funny about this one is

365
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,680
they they glued the two sides together

366
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,399
so you have to pick the front side and

367
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
the back sides all together to open the

368
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,240
lock

369
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,480
so definitely definitely a challenge

370
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,440
and then there are people

371
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
that create

372
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,399
unpickable locks or at least they claim

373
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,759
them to be

374
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,160
unpickable

375
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
any puck that's a friend in the in the

376
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,000
uk i created this particular lock

377
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,880
he uses unpickable with an asterisk like

378
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,519
asterisks like not picked yet he has a

379
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,639
patent on this particular design

380
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,480
from the front it

381
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,759
doesn't look

382
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,040
too bad

383
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,120
but if you take the lock apart we see

384
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
that it consists of

385
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,480
quite clever mechanisms already

386
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440
we have an inner core we have the

387
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,839
the housing and we have an outer core

388
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,759
and body base is

389
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,519
lock on and body basic patent on is a

390
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,000
probability game

391
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,240
like he use a lot of master wafers

392
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,519
as we see here

393
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,480
and all these small wafers

394
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,959
create a lot of different shear lines

395
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,280
for the first core

396
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,839
but the second core can only rotate if

397
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,559
both of the shear lines are met

398
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,280
with the one thicker

399
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,720
thicker pin

400
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,000
so the probability of hitting the second

401
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,880
shear line are much lower

402
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,000
and it also derives us from our usual

403
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,919
usual feedback

404
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,520
so it is definitely a

405
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,120
a fun

406
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,918
fun puzzle

407
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,240
the next one i have here

408
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,120
i bought at some point um a few racks of

409
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
safety deposit boxes

410
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,200
um i use them to store my my locks

411
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
and i removed all the all the cylinders

412
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,960
because i didn't really didn't really

413
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,840
care to lock them up

414
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,440
but these safe deposit boxes are

415
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
usually

416
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,919
you can usually rent them at

417
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,200
at the bank

418
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,640
where they are in a basement in a fault

419
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,840
and you can rent just one locker

420
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,280
it's

421
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,840
it's not that expensive and it's insured

422
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,880
to

423
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,200
to to quite quite a bit i found myself

424
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
and i use it to store

425
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
to store backups

426
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,320
and a few documents that i do i don't

427
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,039
want to lose

428
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
but each it's our own

429
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,640
uh it's ensured to such a high value

430
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
that it might

431
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
you could also put your valuables in

432
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,240
there

433
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,880
but in particular i want to talk about

434
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,480
this lock this is the rows and grants

435
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,039
safe deposit box lock

436
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,000
it's quite quite an interesting

437
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
quite an interesting lock

438
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,039
and it

439
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,679
it's quite an interesting lock

440
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,200
the

441
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,880
it's a form of this detainer

442
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
but the discs are quite quite big

443
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,679
and this is quite difficult to

444
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,360
to manipulate

445
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,280
and they did so intentionally they made

446
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,240
the keys hard to duplicate they made the

447
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,799
they made false notches

448
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,280
in the

449
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,679
in the disks

450
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,400
and that's all to to prevent someone

451
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,480
from getting access to the assets

452
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
without damaging

453
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,360
without damaging the lock

454
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
so here we have the key interacting with

455
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,679
the disks

456
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,480
so of this lock we have

457
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,240
eight elements of

458
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,159
six different depths

459
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,200
different

460
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,559
different shapes

461
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,720
and this is

462
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
more than a million different

463
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,000
different combinations

464
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,720
you cannot get the blanks

465
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,159
of course

466
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,880
most determined attacker would can make

467
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
these make these

468
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,520
but the assumption is if we just have

469
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,799
two keys

470
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,240
these keys only belong to the owner or

471
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,760
the renter

472
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,159
of the of the lock of the box

473
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
then if the lock

474
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
is intact

475
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,039
then um then no one has accessed uh

476
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,840
access the the valuables

477
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,480
and i believe this is more of an

478
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,919
insurance

479
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,480
thing but also of course

480
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,360
how you build your your treadmill

481
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,000
but what i found surprising about this

482
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,440
this lock

483
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,320
is even though it has so many

484
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,240
features to

485
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,000
uh to make a lockpicking heart to make

486
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,360
key duplication hard

487
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,159
it isn't drill resistant the core is

488
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,240
made of a very soft metal

489
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
this isn't a flaw this isn't a

490
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
vulnerability only if you don't know

491
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,880
about it because this is a design choice

492
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,080
they made

493
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,919
they made their lock

494
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,440
so

495
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,080
that it's very hard to hard to

496
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,600
manipulate

497
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,960
but easy to to destroy in case they they

498
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,000
need to destroy it

499
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,960
let's now go from from lock picking and

500
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,120
the infinite patients

501
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,240
to

502
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
a simplified model of a

503
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,200
a burglar

504
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,799
what a burglar wants

505
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,200
access to the items that you have

506
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,679
locked up

507
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,600
and

508
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
some burglars might have fast entry

509
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,679
tools and methods

510
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,840
including bricks including hammers

511
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,440
including axles

512
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,960
you name it

513
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
but it has very little

514
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
time just

515
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,559
just under two minutes

516
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,120
again when we have this same cylinder

517
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,559
there is a very

518
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,600
known

519
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,919
very known flaw in this in the cylinder

520
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,559
and that is

521
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,200
it's mounted with a with a screw hole

522
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,520
and this is also a

523
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,679
a pivot

524
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,960
so there's very little material there

525
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,280
to hold these hold the lock

526
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,400
together

527
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,880
and it is this is such a common

528
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,640
common issue

529
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,520
that the better brands locks the the

530
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
better certified locks will have

531
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,440
hardened bridges

532
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,039
or anti-snap features

533
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,799
so this is a lock

534
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,640
from the uk

535
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,400
where it has

536
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,919
both sides anti-snap features

537
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,159
or pro snap features because they will

538
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,039
snap before the cylinder snaps in two

539
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,480
i like this design and it works work

540
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,240
quite well because then at least you

541
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,960
need two attack methods

542
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,400
to to gain entry

543
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,159
to open this lock

544
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,039
even more pronounced are are locks like

545
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,120
these also from the uk

546
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,679
where it has

547
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,559
two snap features at

548
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,080
both sides of the lock so both internal

549
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,679
as external

550
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,640
that's

551
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,760
not too not too common

552
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,080
and also when you snap the second

553
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,240
feature it has a relocker so

554
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,559
you can never open it from the outside

555
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,200
if the part has been snapped or so the i

556
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,039
so is the idea

557
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,559
and then the middle bit is a

558
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,159
it's a hardened bridge

559
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,919
it's a very tough

560
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,200
metal and it's very difficult to to get

561
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
into this

562
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,000
and the all these features are required

563
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,880
by

564
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,600
uh by the standards they have the the

565
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,559
british british standard

566
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,760
um up to three star and they also have

567
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,240
the the solid secure

568
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,279
and this one is rated solid secure

569
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,679
diamond crate that's the highest of the

570
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,919
high

571
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,440
encircled here in orange

572
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,480
it also protects some protection against

573
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,320
against non-destructive attempts

574
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
and these are

575
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
trap pins

576
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,880
so if you pick the lock

577
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,640
and it rotates

578
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,600
20 or 30 degrees these

579
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
trap pins will fall into the lock

580
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,120
and it is very difficult to to get out

581
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,240
of them

582
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,520
it's certainly not impossible but i've

583
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,000
been practicing with one of these locks

584
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,320
and it took me

585
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,600
better part of of a week to to get past

586
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
these these trap pins

587
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,559
so in all normal circumstances where you

588
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,760
say your burglar only has two minutes

589
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,360
this will be plenty

590
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,600
let's now go for some other security

591
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,158
advice

592
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,039
again you cannot prevent burglaries but

593
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,480
you can make it a lot harder to to get

594
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,480
in

595
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
your thread model is not my treadmill

596
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,919
and i store this this picture with an

597
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,360
elephant

598
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,600
in your kitchen

599
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,440
i don't know how to protect against

600
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,440
elephants

601
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,279
but it would be quite a beefy lock

602
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,840
to do that

603
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,520
what you should do is consider the whole

604
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360
system and then protect your your assets

605
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,520
accordingly

606
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,200
one of the advice we usually give is

607
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,720
key control

608
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,919
so who has your keys

609
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,960
this particular picture is one i put on

610
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,080
twitter

611
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,640
a very long time ago and also on the tag

612
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,720
you could can read that it's from from a

613
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,159
ctf

614
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,080
so if someone fancies please make me key

615
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,279
find me

616
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,559
somewhere

617
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,919
somewhere later

618
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,720
and then we will test it i don't have

619
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,760
the locks with me at on site but we'll

620
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,360
arrange as something

621
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,120
so if we have a picture

622
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,679
then a determined attacker

623
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,320
with enough skill enough knowledge i can

624
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,760
duplicate a key

625
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,440
this is what we call usually key control

626
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,200
and

627
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,760
log manufacturers know this for a very

628
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,159
long time

629
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,200
and

630
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,520
usually you're not able to find the

631
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,840
blank keys to make

632
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,279
to make

633
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,600
a duplicate key without the

634
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,439
authorization of the manufacturer

635
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,919
and here i have a

636
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,520
on on the background

637
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,559
this is a 3d printed key

638
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,120
it's uh was quite a nice nice challenge

639
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,600
it took me like hundreds of attempts

640
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,799
before i got the fdm printer to to work

641
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,799
correctly to print these

642
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,720
almost

643
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,760
tens of micrometer steps

644
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,279
but with with an f not fdm as less

645
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,720
printer

646
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,760
it was

647
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,640
uh

648
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,360
for first first attempt it worked

649
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,679
flawlessly

650
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,679
so again

651
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,320
consider these things in your

652
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,360
in your threat model

653
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,240
also consider

654
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,000
existing security schemes

655
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,559
uh there are plenty plenty of them just

656
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,799
find the relevant ones

657
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,039
for your uh for your country

658
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,880
one you should check is the

659
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,080
what your insurance wants

660
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,880
and then you can go

661
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,000
much higher from there

662
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,080
one most common here in the netherlands

663
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
is skg

664
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,760
and then three three stars will give you

665
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,320
five minutes with a selection of tools

666
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,039
other lock on the background is an mnc

667
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,039
that's a quite affordable

668
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,679
lock maybe not this particular one this

669
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,520
is their latest model

670
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,600
that's

671
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,600
the mnc move it has a movable element

672
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,279
in the tip of the key

673
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,279
and it has some other

674
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,520
other interesting features

675
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,799
that make it very difficult to duplicate

676
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,520
this key

677
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,678
without the authorization from them

678
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,799
so to recap

679
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,600
this

680
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,440
presentation

681
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,720
for your system you want to find your

682
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,000
assets

683
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,120
so think of what is valuable what are

684
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,799
the things that you want to to protect

685
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,159
is it

686
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,520
is it your data is it

687
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,918
money

688
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,080
this can also be at the

689
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,000
your feeling of safety

690
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,559
uh that's uh difficult uh that's a

691
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,120
difficult asset to to protect

692
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,678
but it's definitely definitely an asset

693
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,360
then you want to define your

694
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,440
uh your attacker

695
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,080
so is it someone um is it an entity that

696
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,799
has all the all the time in the world

697
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,880
all the resources in the world then it's

698
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,039
going to be very difficult

699
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,559
to protect your assets

700
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,880
but if it's

701
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,720
my simplified

702
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,120
model of a burglar

703
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,679
then

704
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,640
that might be already a lot easier to

705
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,440
protect against

706
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,440
then you want to find

707
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,039
vulnerabilities

708
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,320
in your system

709
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,320
so either just uh start listing all the

710
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,559
ways to attack your system all the ways

711
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,279
to get to your assets through

712
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,960
an attack tree

713
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,039
but you can also just ask for for help

714
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,880
and for uh non-profits uh tool will

715
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,679
definitely uh

716
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,600
is definitely able to to help

717
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,240
now but we don't do uh

718
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,200
we don't do consultancy and

719
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,080
no no paid gigs in that in that sense

720
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,640
and lastly you want to implement enough

721
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,679
defenses so you get your make it

722
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,279
impossible

723
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,519
for this one attacker to get get access

724
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,159
to your assets or at least to delay them

725
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,120
enough

726
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,678
etc etc

727
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,760
wrapping up

728
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,960
there are two books you should consider

729
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,640
the thread modeling book is is very nice

730
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,480
and also we

731
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,679
have a book about log sport coming in

732
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,080
the very near future

733
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,360
and that's written by jose veyers and

734
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,159
walter belgers and a few other

735
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,120
log sport friends

736
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,320
i do have time for four questions uh now

737
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,240
uh but

738
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,880
if this is any interest to you uh please

739
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
come and see us

740
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,039
at the lockpicking village that's

741
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,679
next door

742
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,500
[Applause]

743
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,440
[Music]

744
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,559
[Applause]

745
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,080
thank you so there is actually some time

746
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,480
for questions if you have any questions

747
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,240
please line up at the microphones in the

748
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
middle of the room and while you do so i

749
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,039
already have a question do you have any

750
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,039
special locks you use at home or are

751
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,240
they just normal ones

752
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,840
they are definitely just commercial

753
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,760
locks but they are

754
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,600
of a special of a special type um for me

755
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,679
it's most important that

756
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,080
uh there if someone ever would get in

757
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
there is damage

758
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,279
i would definitely hate that i'm

759
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,360
is someone in my house or am i losing my

760
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,720
mind

761
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,640
so i rather have them break my door than

762
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,080
pick my locks

763
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,120
okay

764
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,760
so are there any questions from the

765
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,600
audience

766
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,279
don't be shy he's still here

767
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,039
no

768
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,399
then

769
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,799
just thank you very much for the talk

770
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,119
and if someone has a question afterwards

771
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,440
you can always find him and ask that

772
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,850
give a round of applause

773
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,239
[Applause]

774
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,359
you have a question okay

775
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,960
need a few seconds to come up with a

776
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,719
question of course

777
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,800
that's unpickable lock

778
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,040
yes if it were to be a commercial lock

779
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,639
how much do you think it would cost

780
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:31,918
um

781
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,280
he has he has the patent uh but just

782
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,359
just looking at what other people are

783
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,320
selling

784
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,839
then would be

785
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,639
150 pounds something like there but he

786
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,359
is not commercially making them yet

787
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,359
um he is just testing the waters with

788
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,360
this patent and hopefully

789
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,239
[Music]

790
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,719
it's just an inventor and inventors like

791
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,040
to invent things but they don't have the

792
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,839
capability to mass produce

793
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:00,720
locks

794
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,280
so is anyone if anyone is interested

795
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,720
please find andy

796
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,400
