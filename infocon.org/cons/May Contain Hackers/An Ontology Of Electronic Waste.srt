[Music]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,960
i'm an anarchist primarily a hacker and

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,640
reverse engineer

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,400
and i run an e-waste reverse engineering

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,840
laboratory called onbinary where we

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,279
repurpose

7
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,199
e-waste

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,640
i'll start with a little this will be

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
this this talk will not have any slides

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,800
it'll mainly deal with

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,600
our thinking about electronic waste

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,480
and

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
some of the philosophy behind that

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,200
i thought it was necessary to to talk

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
about this subject because we tend to uh

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,200
hacker conferences talk about all the

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,879
technical minutiae

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,039
and details that go into hacking devices

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,199
and reverse engineering devices but not

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,039
enough about the context so i felt it

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,719
would be nice to just have a talk about

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
the context in our thinking

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,680
i'll start with a little personal

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,520
history as this will become relevant to

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
the subject we will discuss

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
later

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
about 22 years ago

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,520
i was an undergraduate interdisciplinary

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,640
arts student

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,400
and a young hacker in the city of the

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,280
hague

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
with an extremely slim budget

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,159
to make ends meet in the first years of

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,600
my studies

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,799
my neighbor

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,320
in my student residence and i both

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,759
obsessed with hacking hardware for music

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,119
would go out late in the evening on

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,720
thursday nights with a shopping cart

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,479
looking for discarded electronics on the

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,560
sidewalks in the hague city center

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,200
you see in the year 2000

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,640
e-waste recycling wasn't strongly

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,920
regulated

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
and people just threw out their beige

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,399
pcs out on the street when they were

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
done with them

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,399
we would also find lots of old stereo

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,880
amplifiers and old dusty crt tvs

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
to our look just a few hundred meters

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,719
from our student residence we had an

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,560
electronics hardware supplier student

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
brand

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,520
and a long street filled with

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,320
second-hand electronics stores

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,840
we would pick up any device we would

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,758
find on the sidewalk

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,920
bring them back to our student residence

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,319
open them up and remove any component we

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,080
could harvest for our projects and

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,319
repair the rest

62
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,680
the repair devices we would sell to

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,040
these second-hand shop owners

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
now i would create diy electronic music

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,000
instruments and play them live in

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
squatted buildings all over the city

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,840
in a time when trash was readily

68
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,599
available to anyone who wanted to do

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,360
something interesting with it

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,959
so were abandoned decaying buildings to

71
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,640
anyone who wanted to make them available

72
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,680
for use by the community

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
the anarchists in the hague around the

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,040
year 2000s were prolific in their

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
attempts to bring life and freedom

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,440
to an otherwise dull and bureaucratic

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
city

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,440
they had an old squatted anarchist

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
stronghold in the middle of the hague

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,239
called the blau onslach or the blue

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,040
fungus in english

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
dozens of anarchists lived there

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,720
published magazines and organized

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
protests

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
they had a theater space called the

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
white space where i would perform my

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,599
first pieces of harsh noise music

88
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,840
a folks goku or a social kitchen called

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,519
the femor

90
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,159
or the murdered butcher

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,080
and a large industrial space called the

92
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,239
pirate bar or the pirate bar in the

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
harbor of schreifeningen

94
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
these spaces would be entirely run by

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
volunteers

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,400
much like this camp but all year round

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,640
and that and they also lived inside and

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,879
around these buildings and honestly the

99
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,400
only ones who would genuinely be

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,239
welcoming to a young black kid with a

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,920
natural propensity to hack

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
a lot has changed

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,000
in the past 20 years

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
i mean in the early 2000s i used to be

105
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,239
surrounded and harassed by skinhead

106
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,840
nazis

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,080
20 years later these p these types make

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
memes and wear suits and run white

109
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,680
winged populist parties in the

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
government

111
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,720
we used to be able to find and create

112
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,000
new and free and public spaces

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
now squatting has been made illegal

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,839
and abandoned buildings are bought by

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
the rich for real estate speculation

116
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,440
and remain empty and unused

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,759
and lastly where we used to be able to

118
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,160
physically see electronic trash in the

119
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,720
street to repair it ourselves

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
now we have recycling parks where the

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,280
sheer volume of electronic trash is

122
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
hidden from the public

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,360
and shipped to low income countries in

124
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,160
the global south

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,160
i kind of covered a lot of ground here

126
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,479
so i need to shortly explain

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,560
why i mention all of these different

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,080
things

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
from personal anecdotes to changes in

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,560
the political climate

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
it's because they're all not that

132
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,240
different

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,320
i'm trying to highlight subtle changes

134
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,639
in the context in which we live and work

135
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,320
and play

136
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
highlighting a sense of freedom

137
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
and independence from government and

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,680
corporate control

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
that we took for granted

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,880
and has slowly disappeared

141
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
i feel this disappearance is the cause

142
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,400
of a lot of our current social and

143
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
environmental problems

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,000
also with electronic waste

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
for instance

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,240
hiding the electronic waste we produce

147
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
behind recycling and environmental waste

148
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
managed waste management strategies

149
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
helps the tech industry greenwash their

150
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,800
products and sell more of it

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
it allows them to continue to project a

152
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,280
mythical future scenario

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,400
where these products will be

154
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
environmentally ethical make our lives

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,680
easier

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,039
more comfortable

157
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,840
and more connected

158
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,440
i'm sure we here are all aware that this

159
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
is obviously a marketing ploy conjured

160
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,160
up by tech companies that sell devices

161
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
and that we don't genuinely believe in

162
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,680
the science fiction sold to us by

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
advertising companies

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,759
somehow i do feel that the underlying

165
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,000
ideological message

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,240
is implicitly accepted by most of us

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,960
the underlying ideological message being

168
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,520
that the technology we use

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,199
sanitized by the visual absence of waste

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
is somehow inherently rational ethical

171
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,638
and clean

172
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
that is created in some kind of sterile

173
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
vacuum unaffected by the randomness and

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,120
unpredictability of life

175
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,800
i get the impression that because it

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,639
portrays itself as the application of

177
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,520
the scientific research that preceded it

178
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
or the product as a reflection of our

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,160
highest scientific achievements

180
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,680
that we are prompted to trust it

181
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
implicitly

182
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,240
this means we automatically gloss over

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
many of the real intentions that

184
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
underlie the introduction of these

185
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,800
products to the general populace and

186
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
adopt a strong tendency to think about

187
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,919
electronics within a reductionist narrow

188
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,360
frame of reference

189
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
without full awareness of the very real

190
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,160
broad environmental and social context

191
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,039
in which it operates again

192
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,120
taking a pluralistic contextual

193
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,360
perspective is important to understand

194
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,560
the mess we are in

195
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
we see this narrow frame of reference

196
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
when thinking about electronics

197
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
demonstrate a character that can only be

198
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,479
described as a dominant and perverse

199
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,800
form of technofeticism

200
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,520
a preoccupation with the benefits of

201
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
technological novelty

202
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,680
the obsession with technological

203
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
aesthetics and the ideal of technology

204
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
as a catalyst for human prosperity

205
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,199
some subjects that pass by the average

206
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,520
person's news feed on a weekly basis are

207
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,400
the elaborate transhumanist fantasies

208
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,319
exploring the future convergence of

209
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,639
humanity and artificial intelligence i'm

210
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,240
sure you've read it

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,440
how we can

212
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,680
clear the ocean of microplastics using

213
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,160
advanced robotics or the promise of

214
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,639
sustainable biomimetic architecture and

215
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
urbanism

216
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,319
even billionaires selling the miracles

217
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,000
private space flight in the future

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,680
colonization of mars and so on

219
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,120
on the other hand there are obviously

220
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,599
also sounds of distrust and alarm

221
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
people who rightfully so address

222
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,960
problematic developments in technology

223
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,560
be it about the dystopian amount of

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
corporate and government surveillance we

225
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,640
are increasingly subjected to

226
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,240
and the rapid disappearance of civil

227
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
liberties that follow

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,760
not to mention news about arms

229
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,479
manufacturers in the west's

230
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,000
military-industrial complex that incite

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
forever wars in order to in order to

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
maintain a lucrative market for

233
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,399
high-tech weaponry

234
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,200
i mean although it is good uh that we

235
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
hear news that is contrary to the

236
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
marketing spin manufacturers use to sell

237
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
their devices

238
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
and it is great that we as hackers

239
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,640
question and interrogate every new

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
technology that emerges

241
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,360
the underlying implicit consumption and

242
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,320
trust in technology that is supposed to

243
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,720
work in a neutral and unbiased way is

244
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,680
surprisingly still intact

245
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,640
what i feel remains in both attitudes

246
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
is that the progression of technological

247
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,920
innovation is somehow inevitable

248
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,279
you could almost say it's like a force

249
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,040
of nature

250
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,600
and that progress in the human condition

251
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
is inextricably linked to the rapid

252
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,959
forward march of technological

253
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,200
innovation

254
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,760
the aforementioned biomimeticism in

255
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,519
architecture and design is a great

256
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,360
example of that

257
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
to my estimation we appear to think that

258
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
by creating biomorphic buildings that

259
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
imitate geometric structures we find in

260
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
nature

261
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
we create technologies that are

262
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,880
harmonious with it

263
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,480
allowing us to avert the growing

264
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,440
problems of global warming and that we

265
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,880
can somehow

266
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,640
reintegrate ourselves within our

267
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,959
ecosystem in ways that doesn't harm the

268
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,600
environment

269
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,640
this shows that all we can do is amend

270
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,320
technological developments we find

271
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,839
problematic

272
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,079
changing the bits we don't like

273
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,279
and keep the rest of the ideology intact

274
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,519
duct taping the problems we face by

275
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,440
iteratively designing new products that

276
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
solve problems the previous one has

277
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,720
created

278
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
while the status quo is unshakably

279
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,199
maintained

280
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,760
now it feels as if certain

281
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
fundamental questions regarding

282
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
technology and our relationship to it

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,079
are not being asked in earnest

284
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,959
and i wonder why

285
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,399
is it because we the public don't

286
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,560
fully understand the intricacies that go

287
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,240
into how technological technological

288
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
products are made

289
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
um is it that we think

290
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,040
this

291
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
this way because it fits our economics

292
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
and the means by which we sustain

293
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
ourselves and our families financially

294
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
or does the problem go farther

295
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,399
is the real problem inherently

296
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,000
ideological

297
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
that the ways in which we think about

298
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,399
ourselves and the environment is stuck

299
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,399
permanently in intermixed with

300
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,040
technology

301
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
perhaps in this sense europe a place

302
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,720
where we

303
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,560
somewhat arrogantly portray ourselves as

304
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
a post-ideological society

305
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
liberated from the backward and

306
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,720
restrictive confines of dogmatic

307
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,399
religion

308
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,519
is still

309
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,800
deeply ideological

310
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,200
maybe we have simply replaced religious

311
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,120
ideology

312
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
with an ideology that favors scientism

313
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
and techno-fetishism

314
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,079
that the disastrous outcomes in the

315
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
forward march of technological

316
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,440
advancement

317
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
are not accidental

318
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,079
but the modus operandi of our society

319
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,720
like i mentioned earlier

320
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,800
electronic waste is an interesting

321
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,320
subject

322
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,800
because its very existence

323
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,440
immediately provides a counterweight to

324
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,160
the dominant ideological narrative

325
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,760
and defies reductionist viewpoints

326
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,279
the problem is inherently pluralistic

327
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,600
if technology advances if it is as they

328
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,560
say

329
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
progress

330
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,360
why do so many of it regress

331
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,360
ending up broken and dead in landfills

332
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
why do the devices which only a few

333
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,320
years ago were heralded as the

334
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
harbingers of the future

335
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,120
now lay idle in a pile

336
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,120
leaking battery fluid into the soil

337
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
in the hope of learning more about this

338
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,839
subject i visited several conferences

339
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,560
and on electronic waste

340
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,519
and um the most bizarre aspect of

341
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,920
visiting these events is that next to

342
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,959
endless

343
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,120
ineffective discussions about

344
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,600
environmental policy

345
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,160
our techno fetishism and capitalistic

346
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,079
obsession with the commodification of

347
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,519
our problems

348
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,920
quickly takes over and yet again

349
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,399
produces a whole range of unnecessary

350
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,160
products and solutions

351
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,760
the term circular economy quote unquote

352
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,320
was also thrown around a lot

353
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,800
in short it is the idea that you can use

354
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,839
waste as a resource for other products

355
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,320
and so close the loop from production to

356
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,959
disposal

357
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,519
i find using this term to again be a

358
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,959
misleading

359
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,199
biomimetic fantasy

360
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,120
as the problems we face aren't just

361
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,079
economic in nature

362
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,920
as i mentioned earlier

363
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,360
the context in which the problem

364
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,680
situates itself is broad

365
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,839
and pluralistic

366
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,959
the objective should not be to extract

367
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,360
economic value from objects and

368
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,320
materials we consider to be waste

369
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,480
but to reimagine

370
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,079
what we consider waste to be

371
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
there's not a single magical competitive

372
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,560
business strategy that is going to work

373
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,040
in time and at scale

374
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
that will outperform solving this crisis

375
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,639
in an open unilateral uncompetitive way

376
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,279
our capitalistic economy is the cause of

377
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,399
the problem

378
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,399
not the solution

379
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,160
short analogy

380
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
expecting capitalism to solve our

381
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,480
environmental problems is like lying in

382
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,240
a hospital bed

383
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,560
dying from a terminal illness

384
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,719
and expecting the disease to cure you

385
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,279
one of the more recent e-waste

386
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,279
conferences i visited had a trade floor

387
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,600
on the ground floor of the event

388
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,760
half of the trade floor was filled with

389
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,040
companies that owned smelting facilities

390
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
or developed state-of-the-art circuit

391
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,839
board shredding machines

392
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,680
there was a lot of talk about artificial

393
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,079
intelligence and cloud-based inventory

394
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,800
solutions for processing waste

395
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,240
but very little talk about the causes

396
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,760
and nature of electronic waste

397
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,519
and the different conceptual ways in

398
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,040
which we can address this massive

399
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,319
problem to begin with

400
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,959
again our current capitalistic economy

401
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,000
is not a rational objective and neutral

402
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,800
exchange of good goods and services

403
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,440
it is an ideological framework

404
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,839
a value system governed by belief

405
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,399
rituals and superstition

406
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,639
it is like an impenetrable monolith that

407
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,079
determines how we think and act

408
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,600
we think we are dealing with a problem

409
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
that is material and pragmatic which

410
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
requires a solution that should shift

411
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
how we extract and exchange monetary

412
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
value in relation to waste

413
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,800
but

414
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
nothing could be farther from the truth

415
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,800
it is time we should come to understand

416
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,439
what the nature of electronic waste is

417
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,399
um conceptually talking about the nature

418
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,959
of electronic waste is philosophically

419
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,920
an ontological question

420
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,399
ontology deals with the nature of being

421
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,639
and perhaps by trying to answer the

422
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,240
question of what electronic waste

423
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,759
actually is

424
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,680
by initiating that process of

425
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,279
investigation

426
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,199
we can find ways to look at the problem

427
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,079
in a different way

428
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,360
we can start anywhere so let's start at

429
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,160
the production of devices um if we start

430
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,959
at the absolute beginning

431
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,600
and i will not go into much detail here

432
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
industrial metals are refined from mind

433
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
or an aggregation of one or more

434
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,920
minerals

435
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,839
the destructive activity of establishing

436
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,320
a mining site once a habit of habitat

437
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,880
for local wildlife

438
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,279
part of a balanced ecosystem

439
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,040
and the activity of extracting the

440
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,679
components of the ore that have utility

441
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,760
in the production process

442
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,839
already unleashes tailings that may

443
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,119
contain arsenic which is a potent poison

444
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,119
barite cadmium

445
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,240
calcite lead which causes widespread

446
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,480
neurological damage and dramatically

447
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,160
impedes on the cognitive development of

448
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,520
children

449
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,039
fluorite more poisonous than lead

450
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,080
manganese sulfur and zinc

451
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
and i believe the harm of radioactive

452
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,600
materials need no further introduction

453
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,240
although the progress uh the process of

454
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,640
creating a device uh causes much more

455
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,240
harm to the environment further down the

456
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,120
line

457
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
than just the tailings that are released

458
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,960
in the environment such as the

459
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,799
tremendous amount of water that is used

460
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,160
in the semiconductor industry for

461
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,679
instance

462
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,080
we can already notice that irreparable

463
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,559
harm is immediately done at the start of

464
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,679
production

465
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
before a device is even brought into

466
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,679
existence

467
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,160
that something had to cease to exist

468
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,080
often permanently

469
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
in order for the device to come into

470
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,399
being

471
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,600
with this knowledge

472
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,799
we arrive at an ontological axiom

473
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,640
that can help us understand what e-waste

474
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
is

475
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
it is the understanding that everything

476
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
that exists is in existence by virtue of

477
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
its existence

478
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
the entire reason for being is existence

479
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,480
itself

480
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,280
what automatically follows is that

481
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,600
when everything in existence by virtue

482
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,880
of itself

483
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,679
is in existence by virtue of itself

484
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,320
any other thing that is not an intrinsic

485
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,640
property of that thing

486
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,559
cannot own or lane claim to it

487
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,200
therefore nobody can own anything

488
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,400
no land

489
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,679
no

490
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,799
especially no person

491
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,360
private property is not theft

492
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,200
private property does not exist

493
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,280
again

494
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,440
things can relate to one another

495
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,640
even demonstrate an interdependence

496
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,200
but they cannot ontologically belong to

497
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,640
each other

498
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
the things we produce with our hands are

499
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,400
no different

500
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,760
our uncanny ability to invent and bring

501
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,600
things into the world

502
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,440
has not yet taught us what it

503
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,840
ontologically means for something to

504
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
exist

505
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,919
this ignorance ignorance results in the

506
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
situation that devices the devices we

507
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,559
create by the very ways in which we

508
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,000
produce them

509
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,720
permanently and destructively infringe

510
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
on the existence of other things

511
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,360
by claiming ownership of their existence

512
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,480
this process

513
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,799
which is kind of like an avalanche in a

514
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,120
snowstorm

515
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,200
is continued after people have thrown

516
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,159
their devices away

517
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,400
uh common causes for throwing devices

518
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
away are blatant over consumption

519
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
a short lifespan of cheap electronic

520
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
devices

521
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,799
to deliberate and planned obsolescence

522
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,799
the inability to repair devices

523
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,520
abandon software support

524
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
end-of-life status of devices

525
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
the destruction of unsold products now

526
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,480
we know amazon is guilty of doing this

527
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,400
frequently

528
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,240
and the reckless dumping of e-waste

529
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,000
now to shortly give an overview of what

530
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,120
happens after devices are discarded

531
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,880
the global e-waste statistics

532
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,080
partnership or the gesp

533
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,679
recently released a document called the

534
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,320
global trans-boundary e-waste e-waste

535
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,200
flows monitor 2022. it's kind of a long

536
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,960
title

537
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,559
which aims to shed some light on the

538
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,240
global flow and processing of e-waste

539
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,159
in that document

540
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,720
we find that in 2019

541
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,600
we produced about 7.3 kilograms of

542
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,120
electronic waste per capita

543
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,559
this sums up to 53.6 million tons of

544
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,400
e-waste

545
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,120
this is expected to rise to a staggering

546
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,200
74.7

547
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,120
million tons of e-waste in in 2030

548
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,360
and 110 million tons by 2050. i mean

549
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
that's ridiculous

550
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,480
this is expected to uh

551
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,120
to go on

552
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,760
as shocking as this projection might be

553
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
uh the most surprising figure i found is

554
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,840
that in 2019

555
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,520
only 17 percent 17 percent or 9.3

556
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,480
million tons of it was managed in a way

557
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,159
that was environmentally sound

558
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,520
this means that 83 percent

559
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,679
or 44.3 million tons of global e-waste

560
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,640
literally fell off our radar

561
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,600
how is that possible

562
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,000
the majority is like mixed up with other

563
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,480
waste streams and that ends up in poor

564
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,000
countries

565
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,440
where they are traded

566
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,799
burned

567
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,840
dissolved in open acid pools

568
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
and dumped in landfills

569
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,559
endangering the health of people that

570
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,760
the process that processes waste and

571
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,520
ultimately the environment at large

572
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,200
and there are areas in ghana

573
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,080
that

574
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,760
is currently called the electronics

575
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,120
graveyard

576
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,760
that is so far that's so large you see

577
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,720
electronic waste onto the horizon

578
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,080
the sky is filled with smoke

579
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,919
and there are people in the informal

580
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,880
sector

581
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
covered in dirt

582
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,799
trying to get something out of it they

583
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,440
can use to feed their families

584
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,559
right

585
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,960
and this is this is also common in china

586
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
we do this

587
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,720
we buy all these iphones we buy all

588
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,960
these devices once we're done with them

589
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,919
we discard them yes great

590
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,640
right we put them in some kind of a

591
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,480
recycling facility

592
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,400
shipped off to africa

593
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,559
right but at least we can pretend that

594
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,200
we're solving the problem

595
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,000
so after the short trajectory from the

596
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
very beginning

597
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,559
to the end of the electronic device

598
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,039
we can argue that in the creation and

599
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,440
the supposed death of a device

600
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,840
it is only a thing that exists

601
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,880
an isolated object unto itself

602
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
for a very short time

603
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,960
so it's only a thing to us at least for

604
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
a very very short time that's when we

605
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,919
use it right that's when it's a thing

606
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,679
that's when it has its own ontological

607
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,279
identity

608
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,039
but that's the shortest part of its life

609
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,840
and if we want to acknowledge its full

610
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,520
life it becomes something entirely

611
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,918
different

612
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,880
a more apt description is that each

613
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,600
device is unique

614
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,440
and is a unique catastrophic event

615
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,480
irreducible to the sum of its parts

616
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,600
an irreversible displacement of matter

617
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,360
and continued impediment to the

618
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,760
environment

619
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,679
once we have unleashed these events into

620
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,159
the world the environment is

621
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,520
irreversibly damaged

622
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,159
in this light

623
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,480
adopting an ontologically nominalist

624
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,240
perspective could be beneficial

625
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,880
ontological nominalism which is a

626
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,919
philosophy about ontology that lost

627
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,720
in the middle ages

628
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,640
it asserts that you cannot refer to

629
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,360
things by their universal properties

630
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,080
but only by their particularities

631
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
for example

632
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,480
to not consider a broken iphone by its

633
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,799
universal ontological properties

634
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,360
right an iphone

635
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,880
but as a particular event in time

636
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,120
with a unique history that ultimately

637
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,320
got its screen cracked

638
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,960
this brings the broader non-reductionist

639
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
pluralistic context back into the

640
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,480
acknowledgement of the problem

641
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,799
the ontological antithesis of this

642
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,720
perspective is

643
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,960
the one the public in general currently

644
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
holds

645
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,840
which is ontologically realistic

646
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,039
ontological realists so not nominalists

647
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,520
would argue that the devices like the

648
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,200
broken iphone

649
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,720
are within the same

650
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
category

651
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,960
a pile of computers

652
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,440
a pile of phones

653
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,559
and this is reflected in policy

654
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
e-waste is considered an abstract

655
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
category

656
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,039
that might contain sub-categories

657
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,039
but an abstract category unto itself

658
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,039
this means that by virtue of its

659
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,120
ontological status

660
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,600
the only way to address it

661
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,640
is by its scale

662
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,159
if you address a problem through its

663
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,080
universals

664
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,159
you will need a solution that addresses

665
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,880
the same universals

666
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
if all you see is a pile

667
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,919
you will treat it as such

668
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,679
this is why we need to return to

669
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,840
ontological nominalism

670
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,720
when discussing e-waste

671
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,279
if each device is

672
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,360
ontologically unique

673
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,200
with its own particularities and

674
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
character

675
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,039
what these devices are and what they

676
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,640
could become

677
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,480
is all of a sudden opened up again

678
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
the former linear and destructive

679
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,760
trajectory of these devices i.e ending

680
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,919
up in ghana

681
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,039
and set aflame

682
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,880
um

683
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,360
suddenly branch into a multitude of

684
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,760
paths and possibilities

685
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,600
now i'm not saying

686
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,559
that this solves the e-waste problem

687
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,840
directly

688
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,640
right

689
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,200
once a device like i said earlier comes

690
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,279
into existence that's it

691
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,039
that's it

692
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,120
there's no way we can go back

693
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,360
right

694
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,000
but what could happen to these devices

695
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,640
is still open

696
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,760
what we could do with these devices

697
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,360
still has a lot of possibilities

698
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,039
so

699
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,720
what was once considered dead and

700
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,159
harmful

701
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:50,960
is

702
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,159
resurrected

703
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,880
uh resurrected and given a new life

704
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
much of what the anarchist did in the

705
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,120
hague 20 years ago

706
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,200
it gives life and freedom

707
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
to an otherwise harmful and bureaucratic

708
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,840
process

709
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,279
now i'm sure you're guessing right now

710
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,559
because i don't have any slides where

711
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,880
i'm going with this

712
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,799
guess which activities are the most

713
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,840
adept

714
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,320
at taking an ontologically anomalous

715
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,799
perspective towards devices

716
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,320
can anybody name

717
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,640
an activity what are we here to do

718
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,799
hack right

719
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,600
and reverse engineering

720
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,559
um

721
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,640
now commonly reverse engineering is

722
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
explained as the reverse

723
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,960
of engineering as it were

724
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,799
where instead of starting at

725
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,399
requirements and ending up with a design

726
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,159
you start with the products and you end

727
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,880
up with information of the design

728
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
now there's something

729
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,200
unique to this process it's not simply

730
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,559
reversible

731
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,919
um

732
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,799
the inverse or opposite of

733
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,039
engineering um

734
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,360
relies on an entirely different set of

735
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,120
thought processes

736
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,640
right let me go back to philosophy for

737
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,120
this in my personal experience reverse

738
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,039
engineering is inherently a heuristic

739
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,640
thought process which is learning by

740
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,279
doing what i mean by this is that i

741
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,799
experience it as an approach to a

742
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,799
problem solving that is often

743
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,720
inefficient imprecise and creative

744
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,960
if you happen to have a broad frame of

745
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,799
reference spanning diverse fields of

746
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,559
knowledge we are all

747
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,000
generalists

748
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,640
one way or another

749
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
this heuristic thought process allows

750
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,399
you to string together

751
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,880
seemingly unrelated things

752
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,720
to help comprehend

753
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,440
whatever is your object of scrutiny

754
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,919
and uncover the rich potentialities that

755
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,760
hide within

756
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,080
you know this is kind of a

757
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,799
convoluted way of saying um

758
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,240
you know it's not a bug it's a feature

759
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,240
now ontological nominalism towards

760
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,159
e-waste and discovering potentialities

761
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,840
might seem like something that doesn't

762
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,600
directly address the magnitude of the

763
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
problems we face

764
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,440
you know i did admit that i i'm not here

765
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,760
with any solutions i'm just here to

766
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,080
address the way of thinking

767
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,520
that will help us

768
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,840
get towards solutions

769
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,279
and that's a step i'm not sure we've

770
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,320
taken yet

771
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,640
um

772
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,320
but we are many

773
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,919
also right um

774
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,640
apologetically hacking and reverse

775
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
engineering devices

776
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,480
immediately removes the biggest cause of

777
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,960
all the problems i just described

778
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,480
the concept of private property

779
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,559
and the governments and corporations

780
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,840
that through it

781
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,760
maintain a stranglehold on the

782
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,440
environment

783
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,720
so

784
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,799
squat their empty buildings

785
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,919
do it again

786
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,679
hack their devices

787
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,519
go dumpster diving and create new

788
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,600
possibilities

789
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,880
the road we on leads to nowhere

790
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,240
and let's imagine new ones instead

791
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,660
thanks

792
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,370
[Applause]

793
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,090
[Music]

794
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:14,860
[Applause]

795
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:24,099
[Music]

796
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,840
thank you very much um

797
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,440
is it already

798
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,320
yes

799
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,799
working maybe we will see

800
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,080
thank you i don't know

801
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,960
yeah you oh we hear something maybe

802
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,080
maybe not okay yeah perfect okay so we

803
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,480
have some time left for our questions so

804
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,320
if anyone has any please line up at the

805
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,720
microphones please be

806
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,240
close to the microphone so that we can

807
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,960
hear you properly properly and please be

808
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
quite concise in your question

809
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,519
so microphone in the middle front please

810
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,559
start

811
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,679
yes uh

812
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,880
i think

813
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,640
that the best way

814
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,279
to reduce electronic waste is to buy

815
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,799
less devices

816
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,519
what do you think i think

817
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,760
we should not buy any device that we

818
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,519
can't use for at least 15 years

819
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,399
so definitely overproduction and

820
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,480
overconsumption is indeed

821
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,799
a problem

822
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,440
if we are less enticed

823
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,840
to buy new products because we find a

824
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,760
myriad of ways

825
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,039
to find new uses for existing products

826
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,080
the incentive is reduced now obviously

827
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,240
that's not something that happens magic

828
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,679
automatically

829
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,240
but indeed i agree with you

830
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,360
by

831
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,200
reverse engineering devices hacking

832
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,519
devices repurposing devices finding new

833
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,519
uses for devices

834
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,919
de-incentivizes

835
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,679
buying new devices

836
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,480
and hopefully

837
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,120
can reduce some of the over consumption

838
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,840
we face

839
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,120
yeah next question again front

840
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,440
microphone yeah um

841
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
do you believe there's any possible

842
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,399
possibility we can return a society to a

843
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,399
culture of tool use where we can

844
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,960
actually sustain the way we use and make

845
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,880
tools for centuries

846
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,840
like

847
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,360
blacksmithing in the old days was

848
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,640
actually

849
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,960
sustained for several thousand years at

850
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,760
a time and it was fairly in line with

851
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,279
our natural development we're a lot less

852
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,880
spread out but nowadays do you think

853
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,640
it's possible with technology at all or

854
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,600
are we on irreversible path

855
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,360
um i have to be

856
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,440
a bit pessimistic here i think we are

857
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,080
partly on irreversible path simply

858
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,919
because there's so many tons of waste

859
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:52,960
you already

860
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,440
deal with

861
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,279
but i do think

862
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,880
that

863
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,640
the resurgence of

864
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,840
anarchism as a social philosophy

865
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,040
should

866
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,440
enable us to think of new ways

867
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,119
to deal with this problem

868
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,760
definitely the state and corporations

869
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,839
should have not only less power but

870
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,280
should be dissolved so

871
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,560
i think we actively should

872
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,599
try and find new ways to live together

873
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,199
and new way

874
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,040
to produce

875
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,079
the tools we need to live

876
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
are there any questions from the

877
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,960
internet do we know that

878
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,800
does anyone have any

879
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,399
no

880
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,000
yes no

881
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,159
good then next question from the front

882
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,918
microphone please

883
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,918
and maybe let another person just line

884
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,319
up behind

885
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,920
i'm a huge fan of civil disobedience he

886
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,800
already mentioned one namely squatting

887
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
but maybe like and i think like in

888
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,560
modern anarchism there's a problem of

889
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,800
like

890
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,440
a very narrow scope of tactics to use

891
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,000
but why not for example go to an apple

892
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,560
store and occupy it so that they don't

893
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,920
cannot sell their devices

894
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,240
yes

895
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,599
yeah what do you think of those kind of

896
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,839
things

897
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,040
any form of direct action is very

898
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,880
welcome so

899
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,400
uh i'll be there to join you

900
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,520
okay next question please

901
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,960
uh well uh you you you say anarchism uh

902
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,599
can solve problems

903
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,560
in essence anarchism

904
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,320
means no laws

905
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,200
no laws at all

906
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,000
the only law is that there is no law but

907
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,560
i think there's it's necessary to have

908
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,320
regulations

909
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,920
to not export this electronic waste to

910
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,720
to countries

911
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,480
which are poor and and can't

912
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,680
can't defend themselves so i think we

913
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,919
should

914
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,119
make this this electronic waste visible

915
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,480
here

916
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,119
um anarchism does not mean that there

917
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,640
are no laws

918
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,280
anarchism means there is no

919
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,200
um

920
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,920
overarching hierarchical

921
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,960
um

922
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,760
dominating force that determines how you

923
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,520
think or act

924
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,400
anarchism means mutual aid

925
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
anarchism means solving problems

926
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,320
together

927
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,720
i think the event we are currently in is

928
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,480
actually a great example of an

929
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
anarchistic practice

930
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,320
everybody is volunteering and look at

931
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,800
how wonderful this event is

932
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,320
next question oh you can okay

933
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,800
and if you also want to help feel free

934
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,839
to sign up but next question

935
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,040
please yes

936
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,800
do you believe that

937
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
the way the way

938
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,599
all tools all equipment all devices are

939
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,839
manufactured nowadays

940
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,000
there's yeah they're they're never

941
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,440
designed to be taken apart again they're

942
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,680
never designed to be repaired but

943
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,040
culturally in the past there has been

944
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,119
more of a tendency like if you look at

945
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,599
the 40s 50s

946
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,640
suddenly i love test gear but

947
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,960
every part of society you could to some

948
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,640
large extent

949
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,560
actually repair things and

950
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,720
most materials were actually available

951
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,640
to remake afterwards

952
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,720
you feel there was like a hegemonic

953
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,880
change where suddenly

954
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,720
some large corporations got together

955
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,160
took over and made the whole like

956
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,920
do you feel there was a shift at some

957
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,160
point where it became worse

958
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,240
philosophically or has it always been

959
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,079
bad

960
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,040
um

961
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
capitalism has always been bad

962
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,690
um

963
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,040
[Music]

964
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,400
i think

965
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,880
i can only go by personal experience

966
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,720
i mean i'm 41 years old and for me

967
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,640
what the biggest difference was

968
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,359
difference uh was was the reagan

969
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,920
thatcher era of privatization and

970
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,520
globalization

971
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,480
that made things dramatically worse

972
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,119
so i would like kind of pinpoint that

973
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,400
time

974
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,720
as being the start of

975
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,760
um

976
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,320
an an

977
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,240
increase of problems we face

978
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,839
okay

979
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,480
then next question please

980
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,160
very much of the hardware that we throw

981
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,240
away is thrown away because we can't

982
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,000
change the software and reverse

983
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,920
engineering can help with that but it's

984
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,640
incredibly laborious

985
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,040
i am really surprised that governments

986
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,760
both know this problem of dumping waste

987
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,280
everywhere

988
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,560
and make no laws to say if you stop

989
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,800
supporting a device

990
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,520
you have to disclose everything needed

991
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
to build your own software on this

992
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,880
device

993
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,720
everything that you had available all

994
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,760
the designs all the schematics all the

995
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,040
whatever all that and if i were to

996
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,880
uh provoke an action that's the

997
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,280
direction i would move it towards sorry

998
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,560
what did you just say i didn't hear you

999
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,359
i

1000
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,359
if i were to set up an action i wouldn't

1001
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,000
focus on an individual apple store even

1002
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,680
though that does catch the news

1003
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,160
definitely but i would also go for this

1004
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,839
to have laws in stated that say you are

1005
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,880
the owner of the device also after the

1006
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,320
the

1007
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,640
the brand stops supporting it then you

1008
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,960
have the right to have the code you have

1009
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,599
the right for all the design schemata

1010
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,119
yeah

1011
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,320
yes

1012
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,920
i find any means by which you obtain

1013
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,560
information of devices absolutely

1014
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,480
legitimate

1015
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,680
uh so there's no bounds in that

1016
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,960
um

1017
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,160
and

1018
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,079
i do not think we need to ask for

1019
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,000
permission

1020
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,920
we don't need permission

1021
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,560
in essence everything is public property

1022
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,400
not common

1023
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
property

1024
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,720
and

1025
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,839
if if these corporations

1026
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,920
claim ownership of intellectual property

1027
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,040
you can simply ignore it

1028
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,319
okay are there any more questions

1029
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,560
someone wanting to ask something by a

1030
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,400
salon stage

1031
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,800
yes you okay back microphone please

1032
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,119
i um i think the previous person was

1033
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,319
trying to

1034
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,520
say that

1035
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,240
you don't need permission but you need

1036
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,800
to go much further those companies need

1037
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,880
to help us with all possible

1038
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,720
documentations sdks in order to bring

1039
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,040
the hardware that they've sold us into

1040
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,079
whichever future life that it could have

1041
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,440
so what you say is ignore their

1042
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,119
uh counter pressure

1043
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,040
and what he's saying is

1044
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,599
take it ten steps further obligate them

1045
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,359
to help you to build your own stuff

1046
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,200
well

1047
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
companies are not

1048
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,680
inanimate objects they are occupied by

1049
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,960
people

1050
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,359
people that work there

1051
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,839
and

1052
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,359
um these people are perfectly uh capable

1053
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,319
of sharing information with the public

1054
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,079
they should simply be incentivized to do

1055
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,160
so

1056
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,200
right

1057
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,079
the

1058
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,160
corporations are not entities they are

1059
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,359
not

1060
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,880
impenetrable

1061
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,800
they are occupied by people people like

1062
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,280
you and me

1063
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,040
and

1064
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,960
what is required is that people

1065
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,160
understand

1066
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,400
the importance of this issue so they

1067
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,960
take matters in their own hands

1068
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,640
that's it that's all we need to do

1069
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,160
yes you may answer

1070
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,119
i think

1071
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,400
then you're

1072
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,599
too passive

1073
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,760
because that's passive yeah yes that is

1074
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,880
passive

1075
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,480
you know what how does that pass if i if

1076
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,520
i ask

1077
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,359
somebody at apple say hey could you give

1078
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,960
me the schematics please let's be

1079
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,160
friends

1080
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,599
how is that passive

1081
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,720
if i go if i go to the protectors of

1082
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,280
private ownership the government

1083
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,640
and i said would you could you please

1084
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,119
ask them to give me your

1085
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,200
to give me their schematics what do you

1086
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,800
think they're gonna say they're there to

1087
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,040
protect the corporations

1088
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,599
okay true if you you that's not that's

1089
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,240
asking for your point you say that

1090
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,960
if we if we don't get the government to

1091
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,359
do the plan that i presented or that

1092
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,040
actually the other we don't need the

1093
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,359
government but it would be so much

1094
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,599
better if we turn the government in such

1095
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,680
a way that they actually start helping

1096
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,400
us

1097
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,920
now that's gonna take ages i agree

1098
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,400
this is gonna be a horrible fight but

1099
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,640
that should be the long-term aim

1100
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,440
how to get there that's the difficulty

1101
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,079
i think that's i think personally i find

1102
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,640
your perspective to be too complacent

1103
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,560
you are expecting people that represent

1104
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,800
themselves as protectors of the public

1105
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
which they are not

1106
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,760
to help you they will not

1107
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,800
there are

1108
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,319
decades of environmental movements and

1109
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,680
and activities

1110
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,520
that that environmental movements have

1111
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,640
done

1112
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,319
in the hope to change policy what has

1113
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,400
that brought us

1114
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,720
right we just had a heat wave

1115
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,520
australia is on fire what

1116
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,839
how much lobbying do you want to do

1117
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,280
like

1118
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,400
okay so um and you have a question yes

1119
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,040
next question please and from microphone

1120
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,440
well i guess it's more of like a

1121
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,319
discussion by now but on tactics and

1122
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,240
strategies like and the tactic is

1123
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,000
occupying or well i'm not saying you

1124
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,200
should petition anything you should

1125
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,119
occupy them and demand whatever we want

1126
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,720
to demand like i think a good start is

1127
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,640
as other said

1128
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,240
open source hardware

1129
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,520
open source software et cetera

1130
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,400
maybe in the overlarging ideological

1131
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,119
framework i think there are for example

1132
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
anarchists in argentina who say you need

1133
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,240
to expand the floor of the cage the

1134
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,000
government is a cage but you need to

1135
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,319
expand the floor of it before you're

1136
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,920
able to fight the big monsters the

1137
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,440
corporations

1138
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,240
so

1139
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,599
we do need some in in between steps i

1140
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,520
would say and i think i agree on for

1141
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,280
example making like

1142
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,200
everything like a common commonly

1143
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,400
licensed

1144
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,280
uh

1145
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
yeah and then you can think of tactics

1146
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
around it but yeah i would say it's it's

1147
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,079
not enough to only hack it's you have to

1148
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,839
also force

1149
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,359
force the the government and the

1150
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,640
corporations force them by

1151
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,400
by yeah by

1152
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,440
well out tactics wealth out our tactics

1153
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,760
that that you get what you want yeah i

1154
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,839
think that is inherently an

1155
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,599
unanarchistic way of dealing with the

1156
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,560
issue

1157
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,960
um the the the um the

1158
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,839
the way to you know there are no

1159
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,839
barriers all of these barriers are

1160
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,000
simply cognitive right

1161
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,960
there the the the government and

1162
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,560
corporations have no

1163
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,800
legitimacy

1164
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,640
their legitimacy is upheld by our belief

1165
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,200
that they should exist

1166
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,240
right that is the problem

1167
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,599
simply

1168
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,000
acting as if you're free which is what

1169
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,400
direct action is

1170
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,880
um you achieve a lot more goals

1171
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,280
than by acknowledging their existence

1172
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,880
and trying to move along the paths

1173
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,440
they've laid out for you

1174
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,680
you are already free

1175
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,760
all you need to do is act

1176
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,400
as this is probably more of a discussion

1177
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,240
than a answer question but thanks for

1178
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,880
your question maybe you could take it

1179
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,640
outside after the talk if that's all

1180
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,319
right for you perhaps i don't i don't

1181
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,640
think our points of view collides but

1182
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,240
thanks yeah

1183
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,839
thanks for asking the question

1184
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,640
and are there any more questions

1185
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,960
yes feel free to use the microphone in

1186
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,359
the front

1187
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,079
so would you call right to repair an

1188
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,319
annika's movement or did it start off as

1189
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,319
one and became more of a

1190
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:39,599
we get the government to change the

1191
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,640
rules sort of movement because in a lot

1192
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,319
of ways right to repair did start out

1193
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,760
that way because it was just people

1194
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,839
forcibly getting the schematics through

1195
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,920
their friends and things and now it's

1196
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
more of a political movement that is on

1197
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,359
the public stage for everyone to see so

1198
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,240
what do you think about writer repair

1199
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,680
um about so about uh

1200
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,119
12 years ago or so i was part of

1201
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,319
a

1202
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,760
hacker group

1203
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,280
in amsterdam

1204
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,480
and we used to have um we used to

1205
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,119
receive stockpiles of hardware

1206
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,280
from people that used to work at

1207
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,240
companies uh on hardware companies and

1208
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,079
telecommunications companies

1209
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,359
and we would

1210
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,440
reflash all of those devices repair them

1211
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,359
and just give them away to everybody who

1212
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,400
needed them

1213
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,359
so indeed like right to repair sounds

1214
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,960
like it started in that environment

1215
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
right

1216
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,000
i do currently feel that the excessive

1217
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,160
lobbying and asking for permission is

1218
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,839
antithetical to its to its origins

1219
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,559
so i agree there yeah

1220
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,760
okay

1221
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,800
i think that's it so please give an last

1222
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,040
round of applause for him

1223
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,839
thank you very much

1224
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,239
