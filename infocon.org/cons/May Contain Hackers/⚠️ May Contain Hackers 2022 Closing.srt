conference that you perceived

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,480
tracks

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,400

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,519
the wiki so it's like

50
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
yeah it was a dilemma to choose what to

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,920
do and uh yeah mostly running around was

52
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,680

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680

thanks to the biggest three sponsors

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,639
that we had accomplished for the gaming

90
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,759

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,960

city

95
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,120
and the whole lot of more sponsors and

96
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280

few days

98
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
thanks to all the sponsors also abiding

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,560
by the sponsor policy that we set up

100
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
and they followed the rules to the

101
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,160
ladder

102
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
so that's what you get when you set

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,160
rules to hackers you get workarounds and

104
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
this is what was one of the excellent

105
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,479
attempts and uh we love them sincerely

106
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,000

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,880

115
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,520
padding on the left and the right of the

116
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840

also volunteers so

175
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,400
things will move slowly likely just

176
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,280
wait

177
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,720
you will be able to depart thank you

178
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,039
to illustrate what we mean this is what

179
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,039
we want to have at the end of the event

180
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,479
so this was

181
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,560
during build up

182
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,039
we want the grass in exactly the same

183
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,840
shade of green

184
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,879
so spray paint for whatever you want

185
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,839
yeah i will put it i'll thank you i'll

186
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
put it up on the wiki so people can

187
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,958
reference it so

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,919
now uh that was it for the uh mandatory

189
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,240
stuff that we had to do um there's a

190
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
small ceremony and then we will do an

191
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,560
orga uh organization a group picture um

192
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,279
so first we do a small ceremony because

193
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
we've been handing out these

194
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
wristbands

195
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,519
but we

196
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
we one we did not check in

197
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,760
so we don't have the badge and etc and

198
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,600
we're not officially here and and

199
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,720
secondly

200
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
we didn't have those wristbands

201
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
ourselves so that that will happen in a

202
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,120
moment and then the organization group

203
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,640
picture so if you're from orga you

204
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
worked a lot you want to be on the

205
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
picture you can join the podium there if

206
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
you don't have a face mask

207
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
they're mandatory here because it would

208
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,080
be

209
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
very fun to have like the entire

210
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,080
organization close to each other all

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,360
spreading covet so

212
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,279
they said like it takes three days

213
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,800
before you have it so that would be

214
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
fitting in the teardown schedule but

215
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,480
that's not the wisest move so

216
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
make sure that in when you're on stage

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
wear face mask then they're also handed

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,760
out over there

219
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,920
so that's it

220
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,220
and i will hand over the mic to dear

221
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:05,839

so i could just start naming names but

302
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
after 100 people or so it gets a bit

303
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,600
tedious

304
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,240
please assemble a little bit to the

305
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,600
front because there are more people

306
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,720
coming and

307
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
smaller people in the front and larger

308
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,360
people in the back

309
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,279
don't fall off there's still room here

310
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,839

314
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,839
we know that these things can have

315
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,199
handle like thousands of kilos so

316
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,130

327
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800

if you have a camera with you please go

329
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
ahead this is the moment that you can

330
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,639
just ignore the photo policy for this

331
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,320
part

332
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,600
so thank you for the organization

333
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600

those who are smart know where the cash

336
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,000
is and we are all here so there's nobody

337
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,079
to guard it

338
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,519
so uh this this was i think

339
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,959
yeah it's a large chunk of the

340
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,800
organization i'm still missing some

341
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,160
faces that said well we will just like

342
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
use and then

343
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,920
drag them in in the most crude matter

344
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,320
