submit a press

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,980
it's a meta search engine to request

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,860
things across the press the online press

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,320

15
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,539

00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,540
april.org associations Association

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,260

neutrality

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,960
which I came through the record unit

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,119
lqdn

27
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:43,560
and well I spent my whole life

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,619
[Music]

29
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,500
being a militant an active user and an

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,079
active member of free software advocacy

31
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,799
associations

32
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,500
and in fact working for Lakota children

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,840
it

34
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,840
I started making the press review of

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,759
this big Association

36
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,500
and it was a lot of work

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,720
because they were fighting against the

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,620
government against a law called Adobe

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,940
which was

40
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,680
uh a try to have the internet connection

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,160
of regular people cut if they were

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,060
fund by a private Enterprise as

43
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,700
downloading and sharing music through

44
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,040
the internet

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,480
and so we were

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,420
explaining that cutting the internet was

47
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,120
something not proportional

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,480
against the freedom of speech and the

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,060
possibility for regular users to even

50
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,760
just pay their taxes and this has been

51
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,060
heard the Adobe is a complete win for us

52
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,200
and it it was 10 years ago but it will

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,540
be finished absolutely in the coming

54
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,280
weeks I think

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,459
but it was a lot of noise in France and

56
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,420
every night after my work I had to go

57
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,760
through the newspapers and search online

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,099
and watch everywhere our press Community

59
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,360
press releases were published

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,700
and it was something like 10 or 20

61
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,620
articles to find to collect to sort and

62
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,620
then to enter in our system for press

63
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,400
review copy pasting the title and the

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
author and the date and the description

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,200
and the link and it's already along to

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,620
explain new the list but you have to

67
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,379
do this again and again for each article

68
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,959
it was taking hours and there were no

69
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,180
tool to help me in this

70
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,420
uh in this task except maybe Google News

71
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,299
which was uh winning the discovery part

72
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:05,939
but we in in other combats like on the

73
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,459
against the ACTA for instance or others

74
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,000
for freedom of speech we were telling a

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,879
lot of uh thing we were thinking about

76
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,699
Google and it was not all nice and we

77
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,160
were you depending on Google to see

78
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,360
which which media did relay what all the

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,180
uh thought we had about the Dominion

80
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,360
position of Google and so I felt in a

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,699
consensus

82
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,419
a defensive cognitive decenses

83
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,940
and I complained I started complaining

84
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,000
on IRC and other channels to say there

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,280
is no tool to do this how we can find an

86
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,080
alternative something that would be free

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,020
softwares and after some years some

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,720
thought came back to me from my master

89
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,479
of uh MBA I have many diplomas and and

90
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,240
it was if there is something missing

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,639
somewhere it means that there is a space

92
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,160
you can you could feel

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,699
and I started working on the tool this

94
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,580
is the best tool to handle the task I I

95
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,840
was at at the moment so it presents like

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,900
this is just a circumshine you put your

97
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,060
Search terms you hit the little button

98
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,860
at the

99
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,100
end of the input and it will

100
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,479
start searching for results

101
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,759
the thing is quite simple a meet-up

102
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,220
search engine it's a search engine that

103
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,919
relay relies on all the search engines

104
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,400
to do the task and so when you hit the

105
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,680
button

106
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,180
um the tool

107
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,580
which is running only inside your web

108
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,940
browser will be hitting something like

109
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,819
500 newspapers

110
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,880
their own search engine feature their

111
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,979
internal search engine feature

112
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,979
and the newspapers will provide some

113
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,380
results we have some results about the

114
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,280
your query and we fetch this we put all

115
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,259
of this in your uh in your page and we

116
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,960
saw this your computer saw this in

117
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,919
chronological order and as surprising as

118
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,800
it could be

119
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,419
it's enough to achieve comparable

120
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,419
results with Google News nothing more no

121
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,199
need for big computers no need for

122
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,600
data centers in the Arctic polar Circle

123
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,580
and no need for more equipment on the

124
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,758
internet

125
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,400
your own phone is already powerful

126
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,599
enough to handle the task

127
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,599
so I said already all of this

128
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,120
I'm sorry finale is quite small on

129
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,660
screen but I can do this

130
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,560
um

131
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,099
so there are some use cases because I

132
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,160
described in a length uh the use case I

133
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,900
had but there are some all or some

134
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,800
others you heard about the MC H20

135
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,819
22 you don't know what it is you can you

136
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,919
might want to search for the press to

137
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,580
heard about who could have speak about

138
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,130
and we still will be faster than you

139
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,080
[Music]

140
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,759
um

141
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,800
it works great for

142
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,099
uh what we call in French The Burning

143
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,000
subjects something that is

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,660
drawing a lot of attention

145
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,020
um

146
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,400
the Press reviews you knew but also the

147
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,759
first contribution I had to this project

148
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,020
when I put it in to put it online to put

149
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,479
it online

150
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,819
in the late

151
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:04,259
2019 was a scientific guy that asked me

152
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,720
if my tool could have been used for

153
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,220
something else that what I was

154
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,340
advertising and his

155
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,319
problem was to search through the online

156
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,740
scientific editors because there are 10

157
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,940
15 of them and he said I have to check

158
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,180
many of the many of them in Rule and

159
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,599
there is no one place to check them all

160
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,880
so I was very happy because it's the

161
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,099
demonstration of what a free software is

162
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,419
I worked years to make something for a

163
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,059
specific purpose and the first guy who

164
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,459
wants to use it say can I do something

165
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,920
else with this please and I said sure

166
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,399
tell me what the sources are I can add

167
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
them to the load to the lot and just I

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,240
had a tag on them you will see there is

169
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,459
a wonderful way to solve the sources by

170
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,519
tags and I had scientific press and

171
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,279
you're ready no other no change in the

172
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,300
code

173
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,760
only Json configuration

174
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,720
um and another one another thing I I

175
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,459
hacked myself my own tool and

176
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,300
um

177
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,620
I knew about the demosphere network of

178
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,300
agendas online on online

179
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,300
participative agendas for for

180
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,240
demonstrations from for protesters and

181
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,080
there are 30 instances of this uh

182
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,000
software and there is no way to search

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,899
in all the time so during nights I added

184
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,080
the 13th and scenes very fast

185
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,240
and I could have said hey there is now a

186
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,040
way to search through all the intenses

187
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,200
in one click

188
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,380
it's easy because results of an online

189
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,279
agenda are

190
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,120
the meaning of the these results is

191
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,540
explained by the dates the date like for

192
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,660
the news in the newspaper what we call

193
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,779
news the important thing is that it's

194
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,839
new so chronological order has a lot of

195
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,140
meaning everything that can be sorted in

196
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,839
a chronological order and still be

197
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,920
meaningful could be added to the the

198
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,980
tool

199
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,640
so uh in fact already in day one uh

200
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,519
three years ago the tool can discover

201
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,380
millions of results

202
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,220
uh

203
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,420
it means that

204
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,180
fetching the 10 last results of each

205
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,360
sources we also get the river indication

206
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,300
of the source about how many results it

207
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,300
have and the millions are here if you

208
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,040
search for China in the big American

209
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,920
newspapers you will have lots of

210
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,240
advertised results

211
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,060
and within seconds uh we'll try your

212
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,720
demo because uh we only have one life

213
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,140
and uh I show in the tool the first

214
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,899
result uh as soon as they arrive so you

215
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,700
don't have the feeling you're waiting

216
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,839
for and when I started this project I

217
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,300
said should I call it meta press it's a

218
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,339
meta search engine everyone will run

219
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,680
away because the meta search engine it

220
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,380
pops up in my head

221
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,140
um the image of Neo when he wakes up

222
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,540
with his keyboard just printed in these

223
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,140
in his face because he is using in this

224
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,440
movie uh in metrics he is using a meta

225
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,540
search engine and it's taking all night

226
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,060
long to fetch results it's not the case

227
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,160
20 seconds and you're done with this

228
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,000
tool you'll see

229
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,139
um

230
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,880
and the two of the main features are the

231
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,160
fact that if you want to make a press

232
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,220
review for instance you will handle the

233
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,740
same search again and again and that's

234
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,320
what I'm doing I have four scheduled

235
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,459
search four in four time in a day uh uh

236
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,760
I have um tab that pops up in my web

237
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,519
browser searching for La quadrature do

238
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,459
net uh I'm still working for this

239
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,480
Association and

240
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,399
it's Drew

241
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,880
um my attention

242
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,700
with graphical things to say there are

243
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,639
some new articles and there is an inside

244
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,279
browser notification

245
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,440
and then I can switch to the tool

246
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,220
activate a selection mode select what I

247
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,880
want uh between the shown results and

248
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,380
Export them

249
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,220
in a reusable format

250
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,660
so you can schedule things

251
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,040
when you want and you can export thing

252
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,560
one General principle I followed making

253
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,819
this tool was

254
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,279
to avoid being

255
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,779
a separation

256
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,519
the software should not be a separation

257
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,000
between you and the newspapers and

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,160
there's the information you want so

259
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,800
everywhere in the tool you find links to

260
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,980
go directly looking at the results in

261
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,139
the source everything can be exported

262
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:35,180
re-imported you should feel free

263
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,820
foreign

264
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,560
saves you a lot of time because it makes

265
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,940
the query

266
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,360
for a lot of newspapers

267
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,279
for you it protects your private life

268
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,800
using meta press

269
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,779
I hit the search engine of the newspaper

270
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:55,680
um

271
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,800
the newspapers you want to to check

272
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,360
and I only download the HTML thing

273
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,199
of the Json part if it's an API but I am

274
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,160
not loading any side content no CSS no

275
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,000
images no JavaScript so it turns off it

276
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,639
was very easy no third party no trackers

277
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,060
no advertisement just the the minimum

278
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,779
information that's why it's fast and it

279
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,600
ended it ends up

280
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
protecting you

281
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,980
but if you use it from a tour browser

282
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,260
it's better

283
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,860
and it helps you avoid the swamp of

284
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,199
third-party trackers and that's from

285
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,540
internet copyright with a great

286
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,699
description of the

287
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,240
tool

288
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,660
one advantage is that it's something you

289
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,420
the the results will always come in the

290
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,500
same order

291
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,500
and if you do twice the same search even

292
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,440
at the opposite side of the earth you

293
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,199
should get twice the same results no

294
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,800
Google bubble no

295
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,199
mixing in the thing to try to find what

296
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,380
you should what what you may want to see

297
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,839
it's just harsh truth thank you

298
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,320
free software

299
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,380
it's a lot customizable and that's why

300
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,260
we start to become better than Google

301
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,519
News

302
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,579
and other gfm news

303
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,560
search engine and it's a decentralized

304
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,360
architecture

305
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,060
it's working from your computer not my

306
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,120
servers I will get back to this so it's

307
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,680
customizable

308
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,040
that's the example if you want to search

309
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,079
in scientific press

310
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,579
you

311
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:55,860
you open this uh you you click on this

312
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,860
button to open up

313
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,600
this uh part of the screen behind the

314
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,079
input and then you select the type of

315
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,339
source you want press press oh it is

316
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,139
called press of reference reference

317
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,940
press because there is a list on

318
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,980
Wikipedia about the best newspapers of

319
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,680
the world it's a game of I like you you

agendas uh easy you want something new

323

a tag on it and we're done

325
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,139
you can also select languages

326
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,639
I support 50 languages because I found

327
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,519
iPhone sources from 50 I think 59

328
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,320
languages

329
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,300
but there is not a lot of each there is

330
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
a lot of French things because

331
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,560
and there is a lot of English things

332
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,380
because I hope you speak at least

333
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,600
English

334
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,139
[Music]

335
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,259
you can also select sources by results

336
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,720
type if you want text things but if you

337
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,819
want images there are some sources with

338
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,819
the tag images image

339
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,039
um

340
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,099
because there are enough newspapers that

341
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,679
have a special entry point for searching

342
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,939
for image

343
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,559
audio for the radio and video

344
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,039
there are some themes but to be true for

345
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,660
the moment the main stump the main the

346
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,720
main tag here is General yeah there are

347
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,720
some financials some ecology but not so

348
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,580
much for the moment and Technical

349
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,860
question

350
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,900
it's for if you want to search through

351
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,539
https only

352
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:49,320
uh through the fast newspapers only or

353
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,600
things like this fast newspaper

354
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
answering generally

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,240
below three seconds and although it's

356
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,299
slow and slow it's more than this I had

357
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,179
to decide

358
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:05,820
there are some buttons

359
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,940
just done this so with this selection

360
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,840
you see that there are 55

361
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,340
scientific press sources

362
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,620
because there are a lot of languages for

363
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,340
a big French thing but expect me more

364
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,280
than expect

365
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,320
less than that 15 maybe 20. uh uh but

366
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,860
still it exists it's usable it it it

367
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,059
answers a need

368
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,179
there is zero needed permission

369
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,120
currently but it's a bottom and if you

370
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,880
see something here like 5 10 or

371
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,760
something it needs it it means that your

372
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,140
web browser

373
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,539
you you did not yet give the permission

374
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,660
to your web browser to go through the

375
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,840
iframes of this sources it means that

376
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,700
you won't get the results if you didn't

377
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,220
give the permission

378
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,380
permission map finally

379
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,220
finally handled you can give them just

380
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,559
for the third and I drop them at the end

381
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,240
of the search or you can keep them

382
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,820
because you will schedule searches and

383
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,919
the permission should stay inside the

384
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,039
web browser uh

385
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,919
and you can drop them when you want from

386
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,100
a button in the settings

387
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,360
these have been designed by with the

388
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,380
community

389
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,780
it was what we've been I've been asking

390
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,080
for the first version was accepting

391
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,340
everything like if it was Adblock and

392
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,880
people said I don't see the need to give

393
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
permission to explore my bank to press

394
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,220
thing and say okay I will ask just for

395
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,940
what needed just when needed but if you

396
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,220
don't get this permission I can't read

397
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,320
the results for you

398
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
you can reset filters you can show

399
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,299
a source list and it's the next slide

400
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,360
because you also can choose your sources

401
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,919
one by one and make your own selection

402
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,440
and this we are far from Google news

403
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,000
with Google News you have the premise

404
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,059
interestable and verifiable promise that

405
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,460
he searched everywhere there is all what

406
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,799
exists and go with it

407
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,220
uh with this tool I say this is the list

408
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,860
of what we search for and you know what

409
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,059
was not searched for now

410
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,860
look you can create a source I will be

411
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,919
we will be back on this later and we you

412
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,780
can schedule something when you set up

413
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,780
your search like you want you try it it

414
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,440
works great you click on the button here

415
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,659
all the settings are saved in in a

416
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:50,580
special place in the settings and you

417
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,679
can activate your schedule search going

418
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,159
through the settings to have it daily

419
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,380
weekly monthly we withdraw nearly

420
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,260
because why

421
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,640
um

422
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,620
so if you click on the source list

423
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,059
button you have something popping up on

424
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,520
the next part of the screen with four

425
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,159
tabs all is the list of all the sources

426
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,740
and I should have waited a bit more

427
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,280
before making my screenshot because some

428
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,020
of the icon did not load yet

429
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,179
the source of the 500s the list of the

430
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,400
500 sources and you can search through

431
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,820
this list with this small input here

432
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,980
so you can also use the tool just to

433
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,039
discover 500 newspapers and for instance

434
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,799
one of my last

435
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,520
addition to the tool was the independent

436
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,080
tag

437
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,340
listing something like 146 newspapers

438
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,120
with the in-depth tag instead of

439
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,400
scientific press and there are sources

440
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,900
with no

441
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,620
um not involved in

442
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,280
the booth the the stock options the

443
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,580
independent press

444
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,320
not state-owned and not Billy are there

445
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,940

446
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,400
so really interesting source of

447
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,580
information

448
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,440
here here we are in front of the best

449
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,520
part

450
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,159
I'm here today to

451
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:32,880

452
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,159
ask you for some help because I'm

453
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,159

454
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,020
great but

455
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,179
I had it

456
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,080
English newspapers and French a lot of

457
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
French newspapers but for instance I

458
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,100
can't work on Egyptian one I know

459
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,120
nothing about the Netherlands press and

460
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,120
I would need your expertise of what are

461
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,700
your preferred newspaper

462
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,000
to add more and more souls to the tool

463
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,740
please try to did US my source list

464
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,600
sending a lot of contribution for new

465
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,320
sources I'll enjoy working in how to do

466
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,740
when there are too much sources

467
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,260
um so

468
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,220
um I made a form to help you

469
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,559
something that

470
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,559
can be handled by Mouse

471
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,480
just you feel the inputs and it detects

472
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,120
automatically everything what it can and

473
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,380
at the end

474
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,679
at the end can we see it yeah there is a

475
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,120
save button

476
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,940
and you created the source

477
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,179
So currently as the title of the

478
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,120
screenshot shows

479
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,200
it works only for RSS type sources but

480
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,000
in the coming months if everything is

481
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,140
sorted up with my great sponsor analyt I

482
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,380
will upload the rest of the of the of

483
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,020
the form so you put the name you put the

484
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,659
link I will Auto detect the favicon the

485
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,299
language the country it's in the

486
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,400
location path that I closed up just to

487
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,980
have everything on screen then there is

488
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,799
a result path where you put the link of

489
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,279
the result page of your source and the

490
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,919
text you searched for and just with this

491
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,279
I will Auto detect if it's a get form a

492
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,159
post form a Json response an HTML

493
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,360
response

494
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,960
and if it's an RSS response if RSS is

495
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,539
available it's Auto detected and you

496
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,559
automatically will uh get the open tags

497
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,059
part

498
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,919
that's what's interesting because you

499
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,919
saved the main work you just just have

500
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,500
to choose the rich tag to put on the

501
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,940
source and you save it and you get it

502
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,120
recorded in your preferences

503
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,860
and then you go to the preference click

504
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,720
on manage source and you will get the

505
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,120
source code Source Json object

506
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,299
definition of the source and this is

507
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,059
what you can email me or put in an issue

508
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:16,860
on the get the repository and I will get

509
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,260
your Source in the next release that's

510
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,539
how it works everything can be done by

511
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,440
Mouse and I will continue working on it

512
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,279
uh we're hoping for a to have everything

513
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,980
automatized

514
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,860
um

515
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,960
RSS sources maybe you've never seen this

516
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,720
in the source and you said or maybe not

517
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,100
existing in fact in fact

518
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,159
uh a third of all the sources of meta

519
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,980
press is working like this because

520
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,640
the most famous famous CMS to make

521
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,900
websites

522
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,820
which is for newspapers WordPress uh it

523
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,140
has it have it has this feature

524
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,179
activated by default

525
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,820
so in every newspaper relying in a

526
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,179
WordPress as journalists don't know how

527
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,279
to configure WordPress they have this

528
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:17,039
activated by default and I am

529
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,200
advertising a lot in France because in

530
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,039
France we have another famous made by

531
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,419
newspapers for newspapers which is

532
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,919
called speep spip and they could do this

533
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,159
but it's not activated by default and I

534
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,960
hope it will come because a lot of

535
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,140
French newspaper are using this and so

536
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,840
you have one chance

537
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,260
over three to hit something that will

538
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,380
pass through the the form

539
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,760
just uh in in a lightning

540
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,880
try and if it's not working you still

541
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,880
can list me the source oh

542
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,419
update your web extension for the next

543
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,020
part when you will have in this part

544
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,120
something more

545
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,640
for CSS for httml sources I will just

546
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,860
show you what you see is what you mean

547
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,100
version of your newspaper with ugly CSS

548
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,559
but readable things and you will click

549
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,679
on title on date on author on on

550
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,580
description on image and I will create

551
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,100
the CSS selector for you and you will

552
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,700
still be able to do everything by mouth

553
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,340
okay that's uh that's the promise and I

554
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,600
will deliver this

555
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,880
it's already working I had an intern

556
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,179
working for this a courageous guy and

557
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,640
and it's a matter of time before I

558
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,779
release this

559
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,539
here are a view of the settings when you

560
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,220
created your source and hit the save

561
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,559
button you can go

562
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,320
down here and hit the manage custom

563
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,000
source and here you will have the

564
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
description in an unbearable for normal

565
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,020
people uh source code view but you copy

566
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,580
past and that's okay

567
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,039
you have a lot of settings internet are

568
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,340
required me to add some settings to save

569
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,220
bandwidth everywhere it was possible

570
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,039
because there are some Far foreign

571
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,100
countries with limited monthly bandwidth

572
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,720
such as Belgium or such as every French

573
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,720
LTE

574
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,380
the registration

575
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,799
and so you can avoid reloading

576
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,200
automatically the search when you change

577
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,419
something or avoid loading images or

578
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,299
things like this I made a lot of things

579
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,779
uh configurable and the permission

580
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,179
buttons are here also or everything in

581
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:49,080
the settings

582
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,200
with nice icons I think the icons are

583
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,820
not showing up in top browser but

584
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,520
reminder it works in top browser it

585
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,080
should work in term browser if it's not

586
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,960
working on top browser hit me it will

587
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,779
use turbosemore and drink water and no

588
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,460
not much

589
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,620
so it's a decentralized architecture

590
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,779
there is no meta press server it's not

591
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:12,779
that I say trust me I am private

592
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,840
friendly no it's a matter of verifiable

593
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,039
facts you can hit the dev tools of your

594
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:23,460
Firefox and just list all the requests

595
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,919
made by the web browser everything based

596
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,620
the mouse and you will see that there

597
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,080
are no requests going to The Meta press

598
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,659
server I'm sure of this there is no meta

599
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:38,520
preserver except the blog and

600
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,299
it's might you might willingly send some

601
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,240
requests with a button in on the main

602
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,080
screen of the results

603
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,779
to say this Source should have sent

604
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,600
results and it didn't all the results

605
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,200
were completely outside of what I wanted

606
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,720
there is a feedback button cited to the

607
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,299
name of the sources that insert your

608
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,600
queries and this is hitting my blog with

609
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,440
a long address with all your complaint

610
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,340
but it's a a non-existing page and I am

611
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,720
already

612
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,240
checking the non-existing page

613
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,340
and the results of my server from time

614
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,700
to time it cost nothing to maintain uh

615
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,080
and I will get your feedback

616
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,360
and it will be dropped automatically uh

617
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,820
two weeks after because it's the quality

618
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,659
poly poly policy of Apache server web

619
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,020
server

620
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,480
as uh we are hitting 500 sources

621
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,399
it will be hard to hide a big

622
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,039
information from 500 sources in 15

623
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,919
countries this is the globally answers

624
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,559
and such a horrible thing

625
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,179
and

626
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,640
there is no system done time if tomorrow

627
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,539
all of you install the web extension it

628
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,279
will not make a big difference but if

629
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,059
the 600 seats were occupied and every

630
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:12,539
600 people were installing 10 times the

631
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:17,100
extension in their different phones and

632
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,799
computers and what computers it would

633
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,700
change still nothing and even if 5

634
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,039
Millions users decided to use it

635
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,440
tomorrow morning it will still change

636
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,919
nothing because except the Mozilla

637
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,960
servers that will send you the web

638
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,940
extension it's your computer that works

639
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,559
the more people use it the more

640
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,019
resources existing already existing

641
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:43,980
resources will be used to handle the

642
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,720
um

643
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,340
queries to under the service

644
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,500
no downtime at a Facebook and not on

645
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,380
time like signal oh a lot of new people

646
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,960
wants to use signal there's nobody

647
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,840
anymore it's a centralized thing and

648
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,760
that's sad

649
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,000
use Braya even if it's empty the battery

650
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,659
energy efficient yes my tool is not

651
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,760
emptying the battery energy efficient

652
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,519
why because of no data center no new

653
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,980
equipment and all the gray energy is

654
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,500
here 80 percent of what cost the

655
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,360
computers is making them not using them

656
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,899
tristanito from X Mozilla Europe shift

657
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:32,840
shift it is now explaining this

658
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,580
uh what is climate change what the

659
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,100
computer are part of it and what we

660
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,960
should avoid we should avoid making new

661
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,600
computers it's 80 of the energy even if

662
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,340
you keep your computer running up and

663
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,700
running 20 years still nothing

664
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,720
um energy efficient

665
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,039
uh I am not bypassing the paywalls

666
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,899
because you will ask for this at the end

667
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:04,140
of the I am not bypassing the peoples my

668
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,340
aim is to have live press healthy press

669
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,919
lots of journalists that can spend your

670
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,380
their life searching for interesting

671
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,779
things and giving you interesting

672
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:18,240
informations so I am just fetching the

673
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,700
result and telling you it exists then

674
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,419
it's their business to sell the Articles

675
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,600
one by one and to survive or to still

676
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,019
keep the last the last century way of

677
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,539
thinking like if they were still selling

678
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:36,299
paper and then with the rest

679
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:42,179
it's it's uh I try to save them

680
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,640
and I try to save them from Google which

681
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,740
is very hard because they don't want to

682
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,399
we have some cases in France

683
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,840
um telling that in fact it's a big

684
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,159
newspapers all they want is Google

685
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,960
giving more money so they want to be

686
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,820
dependent from the state which is giving

687
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,919
them money for them not to die and they

688
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,620
want just more money from another

689
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,960
dominant actor instead of becoming

690
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,179
independent

691
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,159
and to to survive by themselves

692
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,500
for scientists I say so so there are

693
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,000
lots of things you can grow with from

694
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,520
metapress and also you can query open

695
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,540
science

696
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,119
hel is a great

697
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,960
French universities uh and State

698
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,199
initiative but archive and scihub are

699
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,520
really from the free software world and

700
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,280
if you want to query say Hub what do you

701
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,540
need

702
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,820
you need the top browser don't forget

703
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,000
because I have for instance is censored

704
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,409
in French France and they have to change

705
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,739
[Music]

706
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,619
to to play Mouse and Cat game and change

707
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,300
the name regularly

708
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,200
ah so how to to get um I have a blinking

709
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,500
thing to how to get the the extension

710
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,720
you hit

711
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,859
add-ons.mozilla.org you search for meta

712
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,780
press you click on the blue button add

713
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,020
to Firefox it will add a Nikon on your

714
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,180
oh you've seen it works in the door

715
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,760
browser you it will add an icon in your

716
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,000
toolbar if it's not adding this you did

717
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
something wrong or the icon is hidden in

718
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,920
the burger icon

719
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,640
you hit the icon and you get the search

720
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,160
page and when you finish your search you

721
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,680
get the results

722
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,859
are here you can filter by source to get

723
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,079
only the result of a source you can

724
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,180
click on the cross and get rid of the

725
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,460
result from One Source if it's polluting

726
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,900
all your search

727
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,660
because sometimes sources change the

728
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,480
behavior and I need some more time to

729
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,180
change the tags accordingly

730
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,520
and you can go directly to the source

731
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,119
clicking the button you can also search

732
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,480
in the text that you really gathered on

733
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,880
your page and you can filter by dates

734
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,859
and things like this

735
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:08,220
okay at the beginning it was foreign

736
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,540
but I told you this you can activate a

737
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,540
selection mode and select some articles

738
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,480
to export only in RSS Json and CSV

739
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,720
and it helps you to get

740
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,599
um press review live for instance if

741
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,099
your press review is made via WordPress

742
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,220
you hit the selection thing you export

743
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,400
in RSS you go to Wordpress and you

744
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,980
import your RSS in your press review

745
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,180
feed

746
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,660
and that's all you need

747
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,359
it saved all the work I was doing at

748
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,480
night and I'm happy to do it during the

749
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,720
day there are some limits for this tool

750
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,660
it needs meaningful dates and results to

751
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,079
be integrated so agenda also tip of

752
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,619
press but it won't become a general

753
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,300
purpose thing

754
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,619
I added

755
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,920
a date on it but it's not not so a

756
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,680
meaningful date and so it's

757
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,740
currently how to use but still it's

758
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,640
possible

759
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,160
I can only searched in integrated

760
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,500
sources

761
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,060
it exists a lot of sources that I don't

762
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,000
know yet and I need you to integrate

763
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,720
them in in the tool

764
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,720
we need to present the source to the

765
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,459
tool before it's usable

766
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,940
um

767
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,119
currently if you're a researcher you

768
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,500
should you would would want to

769
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,579
be able to dive deep into

770
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:58,220
a subject and the tool is only able to

771
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,800
get the surface of things

772
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,000
you can only get the 10th 10 or 20 or 30

773
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,460
last articles what the source provides

774
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,160
you can't have 10 years old things if

775
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,119
you have uh already new things presented

776
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,820
before I don't get the page 2 of results

777
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,440
from the source

778
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,240
not yet

779
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,700
um it's not planned never

780
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,799
but it's not technically impossible

781
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,180
the search will take

782
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,300
maybe 20 seconds to finish but you have

783
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,540
results uh very quickly but it's still a

784
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,119
meta search engine I can't avoid this it

785
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,119
never be it won't be less than two

786
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,640
seconds uh like it should be for the web

787
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,740
thing

788
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,599
you have still to install something on

789
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,900
your web browser

790
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,400
and that's a limitation because my

791
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,800
mother don't know how to do it

792
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,079
and it exists on the world only four

793
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,060
million people knowing how to install

794
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,180
the best web extension of Mozilla

795
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,579
Firefox

796
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:06,960
there's no email notification contrary

797
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,420
to others but you have in-browser

798
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,579
notifications

799
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,560
it has been funded by the wall on

800
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,800
stifton at the beginning and that's

801
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,640
because handy Miller Megan said to me

802
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,240
once what the free software movement

803
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,320
needs is people doing the right thing uh

804
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,339
from the beginning and from the day time

805
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:34,920
instead of pushing the world in once the

806
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,079
right direction for bunks in the day and

807
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,940
trying to fix their camera during the

808
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,800
night

809
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,380
and he said I have starter coins so

810
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,320
maybe he could save this for you also

811
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,700
he promised a lot and uh

812
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,079
it

813
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,500
it was not all his decision but then the

814
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,859
internet came and

815
00:39:57,859 --> 00:40:01,920
via the ngi zero thing from the European

816
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,740
commission everything worked great and I

817
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,339
am in the dream since two years

818
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:10,619
because I was saying no bus no client

819
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,200
and still saving the life of the world

820
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,420
thanks to Vienna let's also thanks to

821
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,140
the nlnet to just uh gets me discovering

822
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,579
this event

823
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,859
because every even if I knew the home

824
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,560
2013 it took me six months to figure out

825
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,339
that this was the next round of it

826
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:35,760
and it might need you to continue

827
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,980
I would like to still dedicate my life

828
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,140
to this project and if I see

829
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,140
uh what could be my life in 20 or 30

830
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,420
years and if I

831
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,480
look back and see that I have done only

832
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,119
this all my reminding life because I'm

833
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,640
38 old

834
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,680
but still it works and it's used and it

835
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,359
was a success

836
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,640
I not I am not requiring more

837
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,319
uh what comes next

838
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:10,020
a thousand sources come and double the

839
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,780
amount the amount

840
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,000
maybe there are 20 000 sources in the

841
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,160
world maybe more and come and challenge

842
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,099
me we will find solution to under 20 000

843
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:23,640
sources more users yes why not 4 million

844
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,000
in fact for users I will try to adapt

845
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,420
the tool to be

846
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,920
on the read application because we need

847
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,839
this

848
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,319
uh because there is no Android User that

849
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,819
don't know how to install an application

850
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:42,540
you you nowadays you can't get through

851
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,400
the initialization process of your

852
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,160
Android thing without installing for

853
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,020
Samsung for instance without installing

854
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,599
the calculator is application the the

855
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,119
Computing application is not delivered

856
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,520
by default anymore you have to create an

857
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,500
account on Google you want to create an

858
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,119
account on Samsung and maybe you finish

859
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,740
after a half an hour or more you finish

860
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,060
having your your desk appearing at last

861
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,760
so every Android User is knowing how to

862
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,720
install an app and 80 of the smartphone

863
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,940
users are Android and there are millions

864
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,579
of the world

865
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:23,579
they are in fact uh three and a half

866
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,980
I don't know to send it in

867
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,520
uh in English but it's not billion or

868
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,839
half the population of the Earth Earth

869
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:36,180
while for web extension there are four

870
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,579
million at most

871
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:42,660
most user for sure all the platforms and

872
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,579
there will be a web thing but uh it's

873
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,339
exists it's not public yet I don't want

874
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,980
to re-centralize the tool but it exists

875
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,920
it could work

876
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,200
Dynamic Source form creation for long

877
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,599
ago since many years it have been in

878
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,880
what comes next but it's here now you've

879
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,579
seen it just use it please

880
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:09,060
and Report feedback because uh maybe it

881
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,680
needs

882
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,280
and one day I will need a business plan

883
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,500
to survive

884
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,079
um to keep

885
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,900
things in the right order maybe it will

886
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,140
be a side project a hosting platform for

887
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,480
your press reviews that will be easy to

888
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,700
connect to meta press but metapress will

889
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,040
remain the perfect tool it is as a free

890
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,020
software and

891
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,520
the thing will be I might host your

892
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,160
press reviews you send your results in

893
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,680
one click on the sided platform and

894
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,920
hosting costs something maybe not a big

895
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,020
amount but still you will have public

896
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,300
press reviews private press reviews

897
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,000
access to to the web version for

898
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,280
instance and more services around the

899
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,260
tool with a monthly small

900
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,280
rates thing

901
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,900
I'll never get the tool bad

902
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,720
what's next I need you to map all the

903
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,700
newspapers of the world because I won't

904
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,819
be able to do it myself

905
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:20,579
uh we need marketing competencies in the

906
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:24,000
steam because I'm not so good at it

907
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,420
I need information for other events to

908
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,060
where to present the tool

909
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,819
and if you have some question it will be

910
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:35,540
time for it

911
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:39,420
and the waiting for the question to come

912
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,660
but questions should come thank you and

913
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,819

this

922
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,859
um so just like the the scientific

923
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,480
journal request which was your your

924
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,339
first request have there been other

925
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,460
interesting really active users uh with

926
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,920
very specific uh targeted subjects that

927
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,000
have been interesting for you to see

928
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,280
sure sure

929
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,420
um

930
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,060
there are

931
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,060
most French users

932
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,780
we had on top 800 users a day this these

933
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,540
are mozilla's statistics because I don't

934
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,160
compute statistics I don't care about

935
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,339
and the tool is not reporting anything

936
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:38,520
um uh during French holidays we are we

937
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,520
are at 500 users a day there are some

938
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,319
famous users in France like what

939
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,060
retrogenet for instance I am an active

940
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,800
user for recorded internet but also

941
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,579
alternative which is a climate crisis

942
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,940
Association I'm sorry you heard about it

943
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,000
third twice a lot of time every days but

944
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,160
in fact

945
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,380
Scientifics are all agreed about the

946
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,920
fact that the only rational

947
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,599
Behavior we should have regarding

948
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,859
climate change now is to panic okay it

949
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,040
was yesterday's conference so

950
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,579
alternative is reached me and I made

951
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:21,119
some learning session for them to use

952
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,220
the tool and they are in a perfect case

953
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,260
to use the tool because their name is

954
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,480
used anywhere nowhere else so

955
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,020
alternative results is is there

956
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,400
Association for sure a Hyatt also Le

957
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,540
Colibri

958
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,020
uh Association which

959
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,420
came to me to use the tool but Colibri

960
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,660
is the common name of a small bird

961
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,240
and so Colibri you have a lot of false

962
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,180
results in the search it's a limitation

963
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,660
of the tool but I should have written

964
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:57,740
uh I also add ritimo

965
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:02,119
it's a French Association making

966
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:07,319
a general public adult education about a

967
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:12,500
lot of things but also about ecology

968
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,839
and they should soon

969
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,599
established a public statement to ask to

970
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,220
be one of the sources because they

971
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,200
produce content online so they already

972
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,599
are one of the sources but they will ask

973
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,359
publicly to be one because what needs

974
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,520
the project now that it works that it's

975
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,660
great it's to be known so just shout

976
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,880
everywhere that it exists that a

977
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,920
valuable alternative to Google News is

978
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,720
here

979
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,079
um and that everyone should know about

980
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,880
thank you very much now is your question

981
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,540
uh fairly short and clear because I

982
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,740
would like to get it in there yeah

983
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,839
hopefully great thank you thank you for

984
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,000
the talk and the awesome tool I'm

985
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,760
wondering I'm hosting my own uh RSS

986
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,579
reader online Fresh Air SS is a Google

987
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:01,859
Reader clone it would be awesome to

988
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:04,140
integrate it in in that way to get a

989
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,839
dynamic feed so is it anything you're

990
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,380
considering

991
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,619
you produces a dynamic feed online no I

992
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,140
have my own RSS reader like Google

993
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,020
Reader yes a self-hosted version and I

994
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,839
would love to see uh that I could create

995
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,640
a feed that automatically updates in

996
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,740
that reader so not locally in my browser

997
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,339
but if fresh areas for examples also

998
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,920
supports extensions you want to read you

999
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,619
want to read from you want to read

1000
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:38,579
things from metapress in your area yes

1001
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:41,900
yes it's not possible at all because

1002
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,339
metapress is not publishing anything

1003
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,460
online no and I understand but fresh

1004
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,460
areas for example supports extensions so

1005
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,460
if you create an extension for fresh air

1006
