[Music]

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,520
you probably heard or maybe not have

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,039
heard about

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,880
strategic lawsuits against public

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
participation or shortly called slap

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,119
um

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,439
it's something the in the u.s it's quite

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,080
common in europe until now it was rather

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,479
uncommon and it's getting more popular

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,399
popple is probably the wrong word but

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,160
it's getting more used let's put it that

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
way um i'm not the expert but

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
fortunately we have we have an expert on

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,440
stage so please give a very warm welcome

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,680
to naomi colvin and taking actions

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
against slaps in europe

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,600
[Applause]

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,160
thank you very much hello mch and thank

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,840
you for taking some time out of an

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,399
incredibly sunny and lovely

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,559
saturday afternoon to hear about

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,160
nuisance lawsuits

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,199
of all things um my name's naomi colvin

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,680
i work for an ngo called blueprint for

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,439
free speech

26
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,119
as a colleague just pointed out to me we

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,560
do all kinds of different stuff and

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
sometimes it's difficult to summarize

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,640
exactly what we do but we have lots of

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,040
projects running across

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,000
advocacy and campaigns and research and

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,080
policy work and we also do some software

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,320
development as well and you may well be

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,720
hearing a little bit more about that

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,439
towards the end of this talk but to

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,799
start off i'm going to talk about um

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,720
one of the things that we're focusing on

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,680
right now which are slaps nuisance

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,799
lawsuits and different strategies

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,600
for limiting their impact on public

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
debate so but we should start from the

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,240
beginning right and how do you spot

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
a slap

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
and that's one kind of slap it's not

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
exactly what it's a cat's lap it's not

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,920
exactly what we're talking about but

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
there's a slight sort of power imbalance

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
between the big cat and the small cat

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,439
and it's not totally irrelevant to where

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,200
we are um

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,520
slaps stand for strategic lawsuits

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,239
against public participation it's a term

53
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,480
with its origin

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,640
in the u.s but we've been seeing a lot

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
more of them globally and what does it

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
mean

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
lawsuits don't come to you marked with

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
slap so it's more about

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,599
finding different characteristics

60
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,120
that mark

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
particular lawsuits particular kinds of

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,040
legal threats out as slaps and what do

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,879
they have in common they have in common

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,280
a power imbalance between a very

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
powerful wealthy entity

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
and a much weaker

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
entity often an individual or maybe an

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,840
independent media company somebody or

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
something who is contributing to public

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
debate and an important way

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,440
it's a legal maneuver which uses the

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
costs inherent in the legal system

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,120
against its target so if you're targeted

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,200
with a slap it's going to cost you a lot

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,280
in money time

76
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,319
stress the opportunity costs of

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,760
you know what you'd rather be doing

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,280
which is getting on with your work or

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,959
getting on with your activism getting on

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,280
with your writing which you can't do

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,599
because you've got to dedicate all this

82
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,840
time and effort to fighting this

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,000
ridiculous lawsuit which

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,879
may be hopeless to begin with but it

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,400
takes so long

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,080
in order for it to get dismissed that it

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,519
costs you a lot in the meantime

88
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
so how do you spot

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
a slap if you're targeted with it and

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,440
you know there's a real playbook for

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
this particularly if you're a journalist

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,799
and what happens typically is that

93
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
you're writing a story about corruption

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,040
or a very wealthy person or a very

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,879
wealthy company that's doing something a

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,599
bit

97
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,599
dodgy and you've done everything you're

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,680
supposed to and then you contact

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,920
the subject of your article for comment

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,280
like you should do and you've got as a

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,400
you know responsible journalist you've

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,159
got to give them a right of reply and

103
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,920
what you can't get back is not an answer

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,360
to your questions

105
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
it's a massively long letter with a very

106
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
scary letterhead maybe for some very

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,720
expensive legal company possibly

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,200
based in london who knows

109
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,599
with pages and pages of pages are sort

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,959
of nonsense

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,000
allegations ranging from

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,880
defamation to gdpr claims gdpr claims

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
you know great really useful for this

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
because everybody finds it totally

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,080
confusing and it's very complicated and

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,160
nobody feels equipped to respond to that

117
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,479
without advice asking you for all kinds

118
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,800
of information saying oh well you know

119
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
not talking about the allegations but

120
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
you've been using my misusing my

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
personal data and i want to see a

122
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,440
thorough accounting of how you've used

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,759
my personal data in the writing of this

124
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,560
article just total waste wasting your

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,759
time privacy claims harassment claims

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,280
all of this is very common ground for

127
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
slaps so if you get a really long letter

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,840
with a whole shopping list

129
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
of

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
allegations and claims and demands for

131
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,000
information

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
that's a sign that you might be facing a

133
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
slap

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,000
if that letter comes with really

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,280
uh

136
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,039
like really determined threats like this

137
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,560
is confidential you must not tell

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,840
anybody about this letter

139
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
this may not be published

140
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,919
that's another sign of a slap and

141
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,680
actually this is one of the reasons why

142
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,479
until relatively recently we've been

143
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,600
really lacking a lot of hard information

144
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,400
about how serious the slaps problem is

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,759
because

146
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,160
um it's people sometimes take these

147
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
threats seriously and if they take them

148
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,000
seriously to the

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,039
effect that they self-censor as a result

150
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,720
of receiving these kind of threats you

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,840
can bet your life they don't want to

152
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,199
talk about it

153
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,680
so it's really hard to work out it has

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,039
been really hard to work out how

155
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,360
widespread this problem is so threatens

156
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
to keep threats to keep things secret

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
definitely a sign of a slap

158
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,479
really extortionate

159
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,080
demands

160
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
or you know threats that we're going to

161
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
sue you for this much money

162
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
like totally out of proportion to what

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
we're talking about

164
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,720
that's another common sign of a slap

165
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
and this isn't true of all slaps right

166
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
but sometimes

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,039
that

168
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,440
scary letterhead legal company might be

169
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
based in a different jurisdiction from

170
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,800
you you might be threatened you might be

171
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,039
getting a threat from

172
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,840
written by a law firm based in london

173
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
or paris and you're like how the hell

174
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,800
can i

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
fight this i have to like just thinking

176
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,240
about it is really hard and i have to

177
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,199
recruit lawyers in a different

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,720
jurisdiction maybe they'd speak a

179
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
different language to me i'm totally

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,160
unfamiliar with how the legal system

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,680
works in that country

182
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
makes it even harder right much and

183
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,080
really raises the level of threat and

184
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,000
raises a level of challenge and nuisance

185
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
in dealing with it that's a sign of a

186
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,560
slap

187
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,759
and another

188
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,720
giveaway sign of a slap

189
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
if you're a journalist and you write for

190
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,800
and you write for a particular newspaper

191
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
or you're an activist and you do your

192
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
activism through a particular

193
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,000
organization but they're not

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,840
threatening the organization they're

195
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,000
threatening you personally so we're

196
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
gonna sue you for this massive amount of

197
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,599
money and you'll lose your house

198
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,280
personally and nobody's gonna come and

199
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
defend you because we know you've got no

200
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,360
backup you have to do it all by yourself

201
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,840
if they're trying to pick you off

202
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,599
personally trying to separate you off

203
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,599
from an organization you may be you may

204
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,520
be associated with if they're trying to

205
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,960
make it as maximally unfair as possible

206
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,199
hey that's another sign of a slap one of

207
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,840
the characteristic

208
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,560
signs

209
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
so who is getting slapped

210
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,479
at the moment as

211
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,240
i've said we've actually been lacking a

212
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
lot of information on this until

213
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,240
recently there's been

214
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,360
um

215
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,479
a bunch of good research done on

216
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,840
strangely enough in in slaps in

217
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
the majority world and those initiated

218
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
by big countries particularly against

219
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
environmental activists a lot of those

220
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
cases reach courts in various

221
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,199
jurisdictions so there's a record to

222
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,479
follow

223
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,080
the

224
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,680
impact of slaps on journalists or where

225
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,160
threatening letters themselves have been

226
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
effective is much more difficult to

227
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,680
measure there has been some work done on

228
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,840
it recently

229
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,319
so in a report published in november

230
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,639
2020 a group called the foreign policy

231
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,879
center surveyed investigative

232
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,720
journalists international journalists

233
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
people who really specialized in writing

234
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,800
on corruption

235
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
less than 100 of them so a relatively

236
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,319
small sample but you know best we could

237
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,639
do just to get an indication of it and

238
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,120
that report found that three-quarters of

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,519
those surveyed had received a legal

240
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,958
threat

241
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,679
as a result of their work

242
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
so it's almost routine

243
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,240
if you're writing on particular issues

244
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,200
and furthermore and even more worrying

245
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,360
half of those who had received a threat

246
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,080
said that it had affected their work

247
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
in some way they now went about their

248
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,720
work in a different way maybe keeping

249
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,399
more notes as you're going along so you

250
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,880
have something to respond with

251
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
as a result of receiving those legal

252
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,080
threats

253
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
um

254
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
more than that we know that activists

255
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
and campaigners are the subject of slaps

256
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,839
um activists

257
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,480
get sued sometimes by the companies that

258
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
their activism concerns particularly

259
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
environmental activists we're seeing

260
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
more and more the use of

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,320
criminal charges as well

262
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,240
against activists and tightening of the

263
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
criminal law against

264
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,399
assembly and protests which

265
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
quote unquote disrupt

266
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
so

267
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,480
you know and that's part of what i think

268
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
is a wider problem that we're seeing

269
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
more and more of europe which i'll call

270
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,880
government slaps

271
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,120
where the authorities are

272
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,399
actually are

273
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,560
initiating nuisance lawsuits against

274
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,040
ordinary citizens who are exercising

275
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,120
their democratic rights invariably

276
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
rights to assembly and rights of and

277
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
rights of expression

278
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
poland is a pretty extreme example of

279
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,320
that

280
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
at the moment where and i'll talk a bit

281
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
more in detail about that moment where

282
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,519
we've seen a sort of com a two-pronged

283
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,200
attack of

284
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,399
really

285
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,920
like

286
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,720
of defamation suits against people who

287
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
are visible in the public domain

288
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,760
or speaking out online like famous

289
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,839
historians getting sued for defamation

290
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,440
for being critical of the government and

291
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
being sued either by the government or

292
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
by sort of

293
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,959
para government entities which are quite

294
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,399
close to the quite close to the

295
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,800
government and also an epidemic of

296
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,720
misdemeanor charges

297
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
against ordinary citizens who are out on

298
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,200
the streets demonstrating

299
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,440
to try and isolate try and intimidate to

300
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,959
try and dissuade people from exercising

301
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,880
their democratic rights those are also

302
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,279
slaps

303
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,000
so why are we talking about this now

304
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
um

305
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,360
there has been a massive growth in the

306
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
use of slaps over the past five or six

307
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,720
years in europe the there has been a

308
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
survey of

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,200
um all the slap cases which make it to

310
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,959
courts which as i've said is a small

311
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
section of the true problem because it

312
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,040
doesn't include slaps which don't you

313
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,880
know where instances where the legal

314
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
letters themselves are effective but

315
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,360
based on slaps which have made it to

316
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,880
court we know that there's been

317
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
a you know a sort of a five-fold

318
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,079
increase

319
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,720
in in the number of slaps since 2016

320
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
2017 that's within the eu and the larger

321
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,040
council of europe

322
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,279
area so you know and if you think about

323
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,800
it it's obvious why this has happened

324
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,720
because once it's been effective in one

325
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,079
case

326
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,800
the legal firms which which specialize

327
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,839
in

328
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,600
initiating these suits and advise their

329
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
clients to initiate these suits will say

330
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,959
well this worked for this client i'll

331
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,320
advise my next client to give it a go

332
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,440
they're sharing information they're

333
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,200
sharing notes they're launching more

334
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
cases

335
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,800
another big reason why this has become a

336
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
focus for policymakers within in the

337
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,920
european union recently is the fallout

338
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
from daphne marijuana galicia's

339
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,040
assassination

340
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,279
um of course it's nearly five years

341
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
since that happened and lest we forget

342
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,880
those who are ultimately responsible

343
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,920
have still

344
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,360
yet to be prosecuted it's a disgrace

345
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,000
within um our geographic region um but

346
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
at the time of her death daphne was

347
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,480
facing over 40.

348
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
um lawsuits slaps defamation suits which

349
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,279
by all accounts was taking up a great

350
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,760
deal of her time by that point almost a

351
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
full-time job in itself

352
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
thanks to the peculiarities of maltese

353
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,639
law those suits were actually inherited

354
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,560
by her family after she was murdered

355
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,040
and sort of the disgust that that has

356
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,639
definitely

357
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,120
furthered and sort of helped motivate

358
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,000
civil society to organize and press for

359
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
changes

360
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,959
on the european level there's a group

361
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,480
called the coalition against slaps in

362
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,200
europe case which blueprint is a member

363
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,079
of and

364
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,600
with that that movement has shown some

365
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
has had some success um the eu has the

366
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,959
european commission has just published

367
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,839
some draft some draft proposals

368
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,519
um

369
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,600
on the side of government slaps the fact

370
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,399
that covid introduced some obviously

371
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,760
justified

372
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
temporary restrictions on assembly

373
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,399
that's been exploited by governments who

374
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,079
wanted to clamp down on protest and

375
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,600
we've seen a lot more of that and

376
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,040
finally

377
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,399
the uh

378
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,519
invasion of ukraine has meant that even

379
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,320
in

380
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,560
pretty slap friendly jurisdictions of

381
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,720
which the uk is probably the primary

382
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,199
offender taking oligarch money to

383
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,480
launder manage reputations is no longer

384
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,959
the respectable business

385
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,440
it used to be so actually just as i was

386
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,199
on my way out to come to this conference

387
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,440
the uk government published some

388
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,680
proposed some anti-slap proposals

389
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,040
of its own sort of fairly miraculously

390
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,079
so along with daphne there have been

391
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,560
some other recent really egregious slap

392
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,240
cases i'm not saying these are the most

393
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,839
important ones but these are the ones

394
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,279
which

395
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,120
if you like policy makers have taken

396
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
account of partly because we're talking

397
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,480
about russia partly because we're

398
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
talking about journalists like you know

399
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,920
from

400
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,839
established

401
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,920
organized organizations but you know you

402
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,720
know it is important so on this slide

403
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
i'm catherine belton former ft

404
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,040
journalist author of putin's people

405
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,000
um

406
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,959
a book about the milia around putin and

407
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,720
how he how he came to where he is um

408
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,279
published by harpercollins

409
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,839
right at the one year deadline for

410
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,399
initiating a defamation case she was the

411
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,320
subject she and harper collins were the

412
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
subject of a major suit from a whole

413
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
panoply actually of russian oligarchs

414
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,160
like a whole group of them

415
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,440
and she was sued not just in in london

416
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
but also in australia

417
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,880
i apologize now

418
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
some of those

419
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,079
allegations were later dropped and the

420
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,079
case was settled but it's very easy to

421
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,160
see that if you're a publisher

422
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,360
who with that doesn't have quite the

423
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,199
clouts and the resources of

424
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,639
harpercollins you might not want to

425
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,320
publish a book like that because you

426
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,680
won't be able to afford to wouldn't be

427
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
able to afford to do it

428
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
um

429
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,279
not dissimilar tom burgess or another ft

430
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,160
journalist author of kleptopia was sued

431
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,079
by

432
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,800
an entity called the european uh

433
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,199
eurasian natural resources corporation a

434
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,360
highly highly litigious

435
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,079
holding company with some azerbaijani

436
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,279
oligarchs behind it that was

437
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,199
thrown out in the in in london's high

438
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,800
court in a very entertaining ruling

439
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,480
where the judge said well it's funny

440
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,639
that you've not sued about xyz in tom

441
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,160
burgess books which also sounds quite

442
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
critical of you and just sort of

443
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,759
reiterated what everything the book had

444
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,880
been saying basically but enrc also in

445
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
london sued um

446
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
the serious fraud office which is the

447
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,680
agency that which was investigating

448
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,079
them for

449
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,360
for that you know for for their

450
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
activities so that didn't and i think

451
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,320
that

452
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
had an impact and certainly didn't

453
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
endear them to elements of the british

454
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
government and then uh was also pictured

455
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
there of carol cad wallada

456
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
freelance journalist

457
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,600
most associated with writing for the

458
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,079
observer she um

459
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,399
probably know she did a bunch of

460
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,800
reporting on cambridge analytica and the

461
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,480
use of data during the us presidential

462
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,800
election and then

463
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,440
during the 2016 brexit referendum

464
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,000
in the uk she was sued by one of the

465
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,880
major funders of the pro-brexit

466
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,639
campaign in the uk

467
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,440
and what is significant about that case

468
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,279
is that she wasn't sued for anything she

469
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,079
had written at the observer she was sued

470
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,839
by something she wrote on her personal

471
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,000
twitter account and something she said

472
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,639
during a ted talk two instances where

473
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,279
she had no institutional support

474
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,720
from

475
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,000
the observer at all and you know the

476
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,520
guardian observer have a pretty you know

477
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,160
have a pretty hot legal department and

478
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
in these situations it's not

479
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
that say the paper wouldn't want to

480
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,000
support her it's like their insurance

481
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,520
wouldn't cover it

482
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,079
so she was sued

483
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,919
in a way that would make you know that

484
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,160
would exacerbate the power disparities

485
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,799
as much as possible and that abuse

486
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,400
is a tell it's a tell-tale sign of a

487
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
snap

488
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,440
um as i said there is a wider world of

489
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,640
slaps

490
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,520
out there um

491
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,559
there's a lot of new new and growing

492
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,320
obstacles to public participation in

493
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,960
europe um poland presents a pretty

494
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,919
extreme case since 2017 the um

495
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
the government there has basically tried

496
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,120
to um

497
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,200
has basically tried to

498
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,280
outlaw particular debates as part of

499
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,960
public conversation generally um

500
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,320
one of the key observers there has

501
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,080
called it a you know discriminatory

502
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
legalism either laws are used against

503
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
people who the government doesn't like

504
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,480
only again it's very do you know that's

505
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,120
very close to the concept of law fair

506
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
really

507
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,520
vip and economy class versions so if

508
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,200
you're if you're someone with a

509
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
well-known public voice speaking online

510
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,799
you're at risk of being sued for

511
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,280
defamation if you're a protester out on

512
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
the streets you are at risk of being

513
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,400
laid with misdemeanor charges for stupid

514
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
things like using chalk on the pavement

515
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,120
or speaking into a loud hailer

516
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,640
while you know while you're out on the

517
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,400
street these things were formerly not

518
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,480
really used at all we've seen it really

519
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,799
grow since 2017 and it's only really

520
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,400
mutual aid

521
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
amongst polish activists which has

522
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,280
really

523
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,559
kept things going there because it's

524
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
extremely isolating because most of the

525
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,440
people who are being hit by these

526
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,679
misdemeanor charges have never had any

527
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,600
you know never been targeted by their

528
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
government before and it's a very

529
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,360
isolating sort of experience if you have

530
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,880
no one to speak to so

531
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,760
notwithstanding that we all know that

532
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,000
the polish justice system has come under

533
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
pressure over the past few years there

534
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,559
has you know courts have been admirably

535
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,160
um independent in the way they've dealt

536
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,520
with a lot of these

537
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,240
misdemeanor charges but obviously the

538
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,440
impact of being targeted in itself is a

539
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
significant

540
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,919
um

541
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,360
obstacle to further further

542
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,799
participation and

543
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,440
a lot of people have really

544
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
you know left activism entirely um wide

545
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,039
world of law fair i think

546
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,919
if you're looking beyond europe then um

547
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,840
big multinationals

548
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,679
trying to get environment environmental

549
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,080
activists to shut up is like a real

550
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
signature

551
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
type of slap that we see all over the

552
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,520
place and we have these in europe in

553
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,000
europe as well um one where um uh ngo

554
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
based in munich was being sued by an

555
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,080
italian politician

556
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,360
because they talked about the use of

557
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,440
pesticides in south tyrol has only just

558
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,720
been settled and that took you know it's

559
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,159
good that it was dismissed but it took

560
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,760
four or five years to get there which is

561
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,520
a significant

562
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,400
um diversion of time and energy which

563
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
could be better spent

564
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,799
on the issues we care about

565
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,880
so um slaps are a complex problem and it

566
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,000
should be obvious from what i've said

567
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
that there are kind of different kinds

568
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,320
of slaps impacting different kinds of

569
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,720
people it's quite easy to reduce to just

570
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,480
journalists but it's not just

571
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,559
journalists um so we're looking at

572
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,520
diff a few different ways of limit of

573
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,840
limiting managing the problem so there

574
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
are

575
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
um there are definitely legal mechanisms

576
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,799
the interaction of legal mechanisms that

577
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,039
would help limit the impact of slaps so

578
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,280
typically we're looking at things like

579
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,760
introducing mechanisms so that

580
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
cases which bear the hallmark of slaps

581
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,840
say they've been preceded by a lot of

582
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,280
the angry legal letters that i've been

583
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,960
talking about we've not with nonsense

584
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,120
claims so they can go to a judge really

585
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,480
quickly and judge can say this looks

586
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,400
abusive let's get rid of it before it

587
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
starts costing everyone serious money

588
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,159
and then we can also do with

589
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,159
cost regulations which mean that there

590
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,679
is a there's an incentive for the people

591
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,440
who initiate slaps not to do it because

592
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,880
they could be landed with the costs

593
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
that's not the case at the moment

594
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
another side of the problem is training

595
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
and professional standards there is a

596
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
community of lawyers particularly

597
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,159
lawyers based in london

598
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,760
who um

599
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,280
have been involved in you know who

600
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,880
specialize in reputation management and

601
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,120
then initiate a lot of these cases one

602
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,440
of the things that has to happen is

603
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
dealing with professional associations

604
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,600
trying to change internal ethical

605
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,720
standards

606
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
and you know on a professional standards

607
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,440
route make it culturally socially

608
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,360
professionally

609
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,000
unacceptable to be running these kinds

610
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,679
of cases and recommending them to your

611
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,120
clients

612
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,840
another thing so about 10

613
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,440
of slap cases we think the ones that

614
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,720
come to court

615
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,799
have a cross-jurisdictional

616
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,240
element either they're initiated in a

617
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,200
different country or maybe the plaintiff

618
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,720
is in a different country or maybe their

619
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,120
forum shopping to start a case in london

620
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,400
because

621
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
the cost implications are higher and

622
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
then you know it's this way it's more

623
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
dissuasive it's more frightening so

624
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
another thing that can happen is not

625
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,159
enforcing

626
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,600
orders that come out that come out of

627
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
slap cases in other jurisdictions you're

628
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,360
saying well you can say that but we're

629
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,440
not going to enforce the costs order

630
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,720
that's another thing that can happen and

631
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,600
if you like actually this is slightly

632
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,840
hard to find you know

633
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,520
positive outcomes from brexit but this

634
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,039
is part of the brexit dividend frankly

635
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,720
because it's much easier now for the eu

636
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,120
to say

637
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,880
we're not going for we're not going to

638
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,600
enforce that order from london in fact

639
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,720
the uk has not been allowed to rejoin uh

640
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,480
the legano convention which is one of

641
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,240
the agreements which makes

642
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,520
orders in

643
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,200
various european countries automatically

644
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,679
apply in others so

645
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,960
that's something that's hap that is

646
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,000
happening

647
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,360
there are a couple more difficult things

648
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,479
which really should be

649
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
tackled but a bit more difficult i think

650
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,520
realistically one is reforming laws in

651
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,039
national jurisdictions which can easily

652
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,080
be exploited um criminal defamation is

653
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,559
sort of a perennial problem here and

654
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,240
freedom of expression organizations have

655
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,080
been calling on europe particularly

656
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,919
european countries to get rid of

657
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,880
criminal defamation laws for decades but

658
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
that still needs to happen

659
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,000
um other easily exploitable law yeah and

660
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,360
the same thing like getting represent

661
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,960
repressive governments to stop harassing

662
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,400
activists that would be good a little

663
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
bit more difficult

664
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,720
um

665
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,200
trying to stop new repressive laws being

666
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
passed which make activists life more

667
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,000
difficult that you know that would be

668
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,559
optimal tricky

669
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
there are

670
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
some moves which are under discussion as

671
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,440
i mentioned the european commission at

672
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,159
the end of april unveiled an anti-slap

673
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,480
package which includes a draft directive

674
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,400
and a recommendation

675
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
rather predictably and partly because

676
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,640
the eu it's

677
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,120
there's only so much the eu can do when

678
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,559
it comes to

679
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,799
member states you know domestic legal

680
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,400
systems a lot of the really difficult

681
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,640
stuff is in the recommendation rather

682
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,559
than the draft directive so anything

683
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,559
that could potentially become law but

684
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,200
the draft directive will have an impact

685
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,600
if it makes it through the legislative

686
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,679
process without too much too many

687
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,360
problems will have a real impact on

688
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,559
cross-border

689
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,640
cases not just cut not just uh

690
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,720
cases from jurisdictions like the eu but

691
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,279
also eu cross-border cases and actually

692
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,400
one of the

693
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,640
interesting and innovative things in

694
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,440
what the commission is proposing is that

695
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,400
they are using quite a broad

696
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,640
sense of cross-border which doesn't

697
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,320
necessarily mean people are in different

698
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,720
countries but if the public interest in

699
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,480
more than one country is implicated

700
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,080
in a slap then that should be considered

701
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,600
a cross-border slap and something could

702
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,360
be done about it

703
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,480
um

704
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,559
as i mentioned the uk has also come out

705
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,880
with a bunch of with with a bunch of

706
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,760
proposals partly i think this is

707
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,200
it's hard to

708
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,919
see how this would have happened without

709
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,679
um

710
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,240
without the wave of sanctions which has

711
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,840
you know followed the invasion of

712
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,960
ukraine

713
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,840
um

714
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,600
i've not seen you i've not read the uk

715
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,960
proposals in detail because they were

716
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,039
lit they literally were unveiled this

717
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,919
week but the reaction seems to have been

718
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,960
pretty positive and again it introduces

719
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,000
um

720
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,720
a mechanism for early dismissal of cases

721
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,799
which look like with cases which bear

722
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,400
slap-like elements so we'll see how that

723
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,360
goes and there's some other useful stuff

724
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,919
that can be used against slaps um one

725
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,320
before talking about slaps um blueprint

726
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,400
was quite involved in the passage of the

727
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,240
of another eu directive to protect

728
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,919
whistleblowers and there are elements of

729
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,480
that which are pretty relevant to slaps

730
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,520
as well

731
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,760
so retaliation against the whistleblower

732
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,039
as long as they qualify under the

733
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,400
directive

734
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,679
uh

735
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,640
it is banned so that that that's pretty

736
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,000
helpful

737
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,440
there are still some countries in the eu

738
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,039
which haven't implemented the directive

739
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,520
and they're well overdue in doing so but

740
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,960
it already exists

741
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,919
here for instance

742
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,799
so

743
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,360
where do we fit in so

744
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,840
blueprint is running a project called

745
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,080
pat fox pioneering anti-slap training

746
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
for freedom of expression and this is

747
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,600
really a pioneering project we're doing

748
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,679
something which hasn't been done before

749
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,159
at all what we're doing is we're looking

750
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,480
really at the more difficult cases of

751
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
slaps the ones which

752
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
the eu directive of it happens is

753
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
probably not going to impact on so we're

754
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,880
looking really at domestic slabs and

755
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,200
domestic legal systems and you know the

756
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,520
concept of this is really we know that

757
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,440
one of the reasons why

758
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,760
slaps have really increased

759
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,400
over the past few years is because

760
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,919
when lawyers launch slaps and they're

761
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,000
successful they share notes about them

762
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,600
so we want to get defense lawyers

763
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,279
together and share notes about how to

764
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,600
defeat slaps

765
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,919
um we will be we're putting together a

766
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,720
anti-slap curriculum which doesn't exist

767
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,080
it doesn't exist at the moment so it's

768
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,919
quite a task um it's a slightly

769
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,360
complicated endeavor because

770
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,399
slaps violate human rights principles

771
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,720
but they use the peculiarities of

772
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,120
national legal systems to do it so you

773
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,799
need to be able to form a defense on

774
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,600
human rights principles while also

775
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,279
having a lot of familiarity with the

776
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,679
peculiarities of different legal systems

777
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,440
so we're putting together

778
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,480
um

779
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,399
not just a curriculum but sort of a

780
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,799
recipe book for how you put together

781
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,440
a bunch of european law with particular

782
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,039
issues in domestic law or what would be

783
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,480
helpful and what to look for so there's

784
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,240
a lot of different

785
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
there's a lot of voices coming together

786
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,440
on this um the project is operating in

787
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,720
11

788
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,000
eu member states and we're putting

789
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,159
together the curriculum now and then

790
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,080
through the end of this year and through

791
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,760
next year we will be training defense

792
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,399
lawyers in 11 eu member states

793
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,120
if this sounds like something that you

794
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,960
or your organization could benefit from

795
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,559
and you are

796
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,600
in

797
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,679
or have colleagues in any of those 11

798
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,919
countries where we're starting this off

799
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,640
please and get in touch as we are

800
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,399
putting together the sort of invite list

801
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,080
for the first wave of trainings at the

802
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,420
moment

803
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,399
[Music]

804
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,760
further than that we are going to

805
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
make as much of this as we possibly can

806
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,640
open source so specialist

807
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
curriculums and videos of trainings from

808
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,880
each of these countries plus guidance on

809
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,039
how to put together a curriculum

810
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,600
in other eu countries which we're not

811
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,760
covering in the project

812
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,520
we are also

813
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,720
providing

814
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,840
um sort of optional teaching in

815
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,399
whistleblowing law and how to use the

816
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,480
the new eu directive and its national

817
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,039
implementations to help prevent

818
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,200
retaliation against whistleblowers and

819
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,880
then also we've been providing um

820
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,240
digital security training for

821
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,760
journalists for ages and ages so we'll

822
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,440
be also doing this and trying to help

823
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,760
out lawyers as well

824
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,480
and on that subject

825
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,760
we have

826
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,080
a whole bunch of projects in that area

827
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
as well not just teaching people to use

828
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,360
the tools but also developing the tools

829
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,919
so i'm going to hand over briefly to my

830
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,240
colleague richard pospizal who knows way

831
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,679
more about that stuff than i do

832
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,840
all right

833
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,440
nailed it all right um

834
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
hi i'm richard possible um i am a

835
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,520
software developer that works for

836
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,600

project

840
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,879
or maybe not um

841
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,799
um so we want to talk a little bit about

842
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,480
ricochet refresh which is our kind of

843
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,240
project that is being funded by

844
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,200
blueprint through grants um as well as

845
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,039
some of our future work that we are in

846
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,640
the process of working on

847
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,080
so

848
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,240
the the talk was titled you know with

849
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
you know it's a legal talk so but we're

850
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
sneaking some text often at the end

851
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,559
so uh just as a show of hands can i get

852
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,240
an idea of like who here under like

853
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
knows how tor works is kind of

854
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,120
understanding of underrouting and not

855
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,279
and how about hidden services about

856
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,279
hidden services

857
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,080
okay

858
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,039
so rickshaw refresh is a

859
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,200
open source private anonymous messaging

860
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,960
app um

861
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,200
it's originally a fork of ricochet i am

862
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,559
which came out like 10 15 years ago

863
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,159
was originally based off of v2 owning

864
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,240
services which if you've been following

865
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,720
tor has been deprecated since like

866
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,880
october of last year

867
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,559
but where i started prior to that to

868
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,799
upgrading it to work with v3 and add

869
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,799
various other features

870
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,799
and just a high level of how it works is

871
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,960
it takes advantage of

872
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,720
tor's onion service feature or hidden

873
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,640
services there used to be called and the

874
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,559
idea behind a hidden service or onion

875
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,960
service is that you have an address it's

876
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,760
a very long kind of id which is also a

877
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,760
public key which you can use to

878
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,080
privately and anonymously have a service

879
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,360
on the internet so i won't go into the

880
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,440
details of how that works because it

881
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,279
doesn't matter for this purpose assuming

882
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,360
assuming you have that building block of

883
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,080
having the ability to open up a service

884
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,600
to the internet without anybody knowing

885
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,679
where you are or who you are

886
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,440
you have built a

887
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,120
instant messaging app on top of that so

888
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,080
basically everybody's ricochet

889
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,399
refresh and before that ricochet i am id

890
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,320
is one of these onion services if you

891
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,679
want to talk to somebody you need to

892
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,960
know their audience service and they

893
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,880
need to have ricochet running and

894
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,559
there's a handshake that happens that

895
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,240
lets you connect and they say are you

896
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,640
who you are are you who you say you are

897
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,399
and you say yes i am who i am who i say

898
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,279
i am

899
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,200
and you can connect and chat and

900
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,039
transfer files and do all the kind of

901
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,960
things that you would expect

902
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
um in instant messenger

903
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,159
um

904
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,760
so that's cool

905
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,480
um we've also added in a file transfer

906
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,919
sometime in the past year on top of that

907
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,600
so it's something the original ricochet

908
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,120
item did not have

909
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,240
um

910
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,320
so we've kind of targeted this towards

911
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,000
whistleblowers um as kind of like our

912
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,080
target demographic just because

913
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,440
there's not really a good solution like

914
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,200
right now the kind of go-to solution is

915
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,120
oh you want to talk securely um you know

916
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,279
use signal which

917
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,080
is great uh it's not anonymous but you

918
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,480
know it's better than nothing

919
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,399
um you still have that kind of

920
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,080
identifier tied to your phone number

921
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,159
which for some time models is fine you

922
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,440
know just talking to your friends about

923
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,679
where you want to get dinner

924
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,679
cool you know it's great but if you are

925
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,679
somebody whose life might be in danger

926
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,519
or somebody who might get sued you want

927
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,559
to talk to

928
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,600
somebody

929
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,159
uh like a journalist or or specialist

930
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,760
and whatever it is you care about then

931
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
you need really actually need like an

932
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,080
anonymity guarantees that are

933
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,880
you know

934
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
provable by the actual technology not

935
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,480
just because you know some technology

936
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
says oh no yeah you're totally anonymous

937
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,240
and you know we don't log in anything we

938
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,159
promise it's like whether it's a refresh

939
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,760
you can actually guarantee yes you are

940
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,960
anonymous

941
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,720
um

942
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,600
but

943
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,039
oh yeah it will have this little slice

944
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,320
this is you know the kind of generic

945
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,559
like this is how tour works uh slide so

946
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,559
you have you know the tor network and

947
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,840
you have another service and they have

948
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,600
not even service and when you open up

949
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,679
ricochet refresh you go in and you

950
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,799
connect to all the various online

951
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,480
services of all your contacts and kind

952
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,720
of initiate a hand handshake and

953
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,000
you can determine while your all your

954
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,679
contacts are online and just kind of

955
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,880
talk and normally you wouldn't listen

956
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,039
messenger

957
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,600
there are some problems um with the

958
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,559
current rookie refresh sort of handshake

959
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,200
which were kind of where

960
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,880
sort of properties of how onion services

961
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,120
work so right now

962
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,720
if you

963
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,679
want to share your handle in any kind of

964
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,440
like chat clients like

965
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,880
able and semester that comes to mind

966
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,799
that's just because i'm old so like icq

967
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,320
or

968
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,000
msn

969
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,760
you know you have a handle and you add

970
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,559
your

971
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,399
somebody's handle to your contact list

972
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,760
make a phone request and you see if you

973
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,960
want to be friends um but because

974
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,239
you know you are going through a

975
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,320
centralized server in that case that

976
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,399
centralized server doesn't expose

977
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,399
people's online offline status unless

978
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,599
you're actually friends and they can

979
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,879
kind of like guard that because

980
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,239
everybody's connecting to the server and

981
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,399
going through the centralized uh

982
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,520
situation

983
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,000
with ricochet refresh and onion services

984
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,199
in general

985
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,399
if you know the onion service id

986
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,760
or the just the address you use the

987
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,440
connection learning service then you can

988
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,719
tell when they're online all you have to

989
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,800
do is open up a socket over tor and even

990
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
if you even if the service is protected

991
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
by client authorization

992
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,280
you can still determine if the service

993
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,399
is online

994
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,719
which is not great

995
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,199
um especially when that sort of like

996
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,599
metadata can be used to prosecute people

997
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,119
or like identify

998
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,200
like oh you know we are pretty sure that

999
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
this person over here is actually this

1000
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
user over there

1001
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
um so we're gonna spy in their house and

1002
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,119
sure enough as soon as they you know

1003
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,280
turn off their laptop and go to the cafe

1004
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,040
this user disappears and then once they

1005
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,320
you know open up the laptop again they

1006
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,079
come back online

1007
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,280
you know that's not the best so um

1008
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,320
that's kind of where gosling comes in so

1009
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,599
wait what nope all right this is still

1010
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,800
rickshaw refresh that's what it looks

1011
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
like it's an app

1012
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,920
you can download it here

1013
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,880
this is where gosling comes into play so

1014
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,720
gosling is basically a

1015
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,400
kind of ground-up reimagining and

1016
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,320
re-implementation of

1017
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
how that sort of beginning

1018
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,480
authentication handshake should work

1019
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,960
um we've taken kind of what we know

1020
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,119
about how onion services currently work

1021
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,040
and are working around that limitation

1022
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,560
of that kind of like what we call the

1023
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,400
cyber stalking problem where you have

1024
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
this identifier and you have no way of

1025
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,880
really using ricochet

1026
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,400
and also controlling what people can see

1027
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,359
about you which sucks

1028
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,400
you know i mean it's fine so long as

1029
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,599
i would say like the current reaction

1030
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,440
refresh is fine so long as you don't

1031
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,680
publishly or publicly publish what your

1032
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,960
id is

1033
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,880
so if you just like you and your friends

1034
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,839
all want to you know swap ids and that

1035
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,320
never like leaks outside the group then

1036
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,560
all any adversary is going to see is

1037
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,200
yeah these people are using tor

1038
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,359
okay that could be anything assuming

1039
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,680
they are like super sneaky and like

1040
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,000
using a d-pack inspection or you know

1041
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,760
doing traffic analysis or

1042
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,400
super advanced stuff right um

1043
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,320
so gosling kind of

1044
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,400
takes all that information and breaks

1045
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,920
apart your

1046
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,320
separates your identity from who your

1047
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,359
actual

1048
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,119
endpoints that you use to communicate

1049
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,560
with people so you have you still have a

1050
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,960
public identity and a public

1051
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,320
um

1052
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,599
audience service we call this like the

1053
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,079
introduction service which

1054
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,440
they will probably change because it

1055
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,040
kind of

1056
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,280
um collides with the idea of like

1057
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,880
introduction node and tor which really

1058
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,640
we don't want to confuse the two so the

1059
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,920
name will probably change so we start

1060
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,240
with an introduction server um that you

1061
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,520
use as your public identifier just as

1062
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,800
you do now with ricochet refresh and

1063
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,040
you can turn that off whenever you want

1064
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,280
but still talk to your contacts

1065
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,599
because what happens is when you do this

1066
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,280
initial kind of handshake with the

1067
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,000
introduction server is that you know a

1068
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,920
bunch of crypto to verify that like the

1069
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,760
person contacting you is saying like yes

1070
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,640
i am

1071
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
this other onion service over here on

1072
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,920
the internet and these are my keys so

1073
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,680
you know use some signature verification

1074
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,440
and build a handshake and

1075
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
make sure they are who they at least at

1076
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,480
least they make sure they at least

1077
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,440
control the keys they claim they control

1078
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,280
and as part of that kind of handshake if

1079
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,599
it succeeds it hands out a endpoint

1080
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,839
server which is unique to that

1081
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,640
particular client so if that client

1082
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,680
then you know wants to cyber stalk you

1083
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,359
then like one you have to have accepted

1084
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,800
them as a friend

1085
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,480
um

1086
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,160
and you know then they can you know

1087
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,520
cyber stalk your endpoint but you can

1088
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,480
just block them or better yet just stop

1089
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,720
running that endpoint and they won't be

1090
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,000
able to turn when you're actually online

1091
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,200
they can still see your end your

1092
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,720
introduction server but the cool thing

1093
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,320
about the introduction server is that

1094
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,599
you don't actually need that to talk to

1095
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,440
your friends like if you add you know

1096
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,520
your five buddies as contacts or add

1097
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,640
your you know uh journalist um contact

1098
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,280
as a contact then you can just turn that

1099
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,520
server off once the endpoints have been

1100
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,720
like uh negotiated and nobody outside

1101
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,760
that will just know like well they used

1102
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,880
to have the client service and now the

1103
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,280
science purpose doesn't exist anymore so

1104
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,599
it's kind of a

1105
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,440
it's kind of like a long longer term

1106
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,960
like identity and kind of works like the

1107
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,240
handshake of briar like they do a

1108
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,880
similar thing but with like a ephemeral

1109
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,560
um onion service to that kind of like

1110
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,400
introduction handshake and then and then

1111
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
hand it off but

1112
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,640
so we're kind of are working on

1113
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,480
uh re

1114
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,160
reworking that kind of handshake part

1115
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,079
and separating it out as a

1116
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,240
its own library because you know while

1117
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,320
working on a peer appearance messenger

1118
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,079
occurred to me like you know there are

1119
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,160
other peer-to-peer applications that

1120
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,680
might want to exist and also be

1121
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,000
anonymous so we're kind of pulling out

1122
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,920
this layer and the tour management and

1123
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,400
the key generation and all of that

1124
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,640
putting into a nice rust library and

1125
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,960
we'll eventually be ripping out the guts

1126
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,560
so the current rickshaw refresh and

1127
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,480
using this for that low level

1128
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
application low level like kind of

1129
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
authentic authentication application

1130
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,599
and then

1131
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,640
um

1132
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
building an instant messenger on top of

1133
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160
that like once like once you've done

1134
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,359
that kind of handshake then you just

1135
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,280
hand the socket off to the next like the

1136
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,760
higher level part of the application and

1137
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
it can do whatever it needs to do

1138
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,359
safe knowing that if it received the

1139
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,680
connection then it came from who you

1140
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,520
think it is and you know that you're

1141
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,599
private and anonymous and all that good

1142
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,520
stuff so

1143
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,880
you can go here we have specs there is a

1144
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,480
not quite working implementation as a

1145
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
work in progress

1146
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,800
um

1147
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,599
but we're expecting to have a work of

1148
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,280
proof of concept sort of implementation

1149
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,160
working within the next month or two so

1150
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,440
come by um it has been

1151
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,119
not audited but somewhat somewhat

1152
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,200
reviewed by various

1153
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,400
smart people who know how to use

1154
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,480
cryptography more than i do

1155
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,359
but obviously issues and pull requests

1156
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,160
are

1157
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,880
very helpful and welcome so

1158
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,150
that's my bit

1159
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,720
[Music]

1160
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,160
[Applause]

[Applause]

1163
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,800
i guess i'll let you earned okay yeah i

1164
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
guess i i guess we have a little bit of

1165
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,640
time for any questions is that right

1166
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,720
absolutely please please stay on stage

1167
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,440
maybe we have a technical question so um

1168
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,000
we do have time for q and a if you have

1169
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,079
a question please line up on on both of

1170
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,720
the microphones um as we have no

1171
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,319
question from the internet yet we'll

1172
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,720
take the microsoft uh the microsoft oh

1173
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,480
my god

1174
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,200
the microphone in the front please step

1175
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,359
up to the microphone come close and

1176
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,880
please ask your question uh so

1177
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,640
technical question there uh does the

1178
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,359
ricochet uh support this new ricochet

1179
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,640
does it support the synchronous

1180
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,240
communication or is it only synchronous

1181
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,440
hello

1182
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,319
hello okay yeah it's only synchronous so

1183
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,839
um because there's no centralized

1184
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,200
service for you to connect to it does

1185
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,920
depend on you being actually online to

1186
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,480
receive you know any kind cool

1187
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,400
so a question for naomi on the other

1188
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,520
topic

1189
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
sorry um so

1190
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,319
um do you think we'll see more slaps in

1191
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,119
the eu should people be bracing for this

1192
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,400
especially

1193
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,280
because i

1194
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,960
also thank you so much for the work

1195
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,040
you're doing with the especially reading

1196
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,240
up the lawyer part of the thing uh but

1197
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,920
in terms of the community

1198
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,680
you mentioned the mutual aid that

1199
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,520
happened defending the polish people

1200
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
let's even think about like the people

1201
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,280
doing the protesters in bristol and

1202
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,400
other places yeah where you know so

1203
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,040
is that something that potfox would

1204
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
address as well so like either helping

1205
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,160
or providing that layer for for that

1206
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,800
layer of the targets of slaps and so on

1207
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,839
thank so the project

1208
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,280
the project is targeted towards

1209
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,040
qualified lawyers but we're really

1210
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,040
interested in

1211
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,520
reaching say the lawyers who and

1212
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,200
activists pro bono and the people who um

1213
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,280
defend lgbt activists and other kinds of

1214
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,560
activists you know that so that's

1215
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,800
totally within scope of what we

1216
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,640
of what we want to do and i think you're

1217
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,960
right to pick out bristol and that you

1218
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,160
know where

1219
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,599
there were some protests last year

1220
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,960
people may not know

1221
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,160
and um as a result um people have been

1222
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,359
facing riot charges in the uk which is

1223
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,599
hasn't been heard of for many many years

1224
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,040
and the penalties for riots are really

1225
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,400
severe we're talking about decade you

1226
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,280
know

1227
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,480
the police bill is here now so yeah yeah

1228
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,000
what is happening in the uk is kind of

1229
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,599
emblematic of what we might see

1230
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,240
elsewhere as well in that

1231
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,440
um

1232
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,480
slaps as far as they impact on

1233
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,760
journalists who write for major

1234
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,359
publications there's some action against

1235
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,480
limiting those

1236
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,160
coming up against

1237
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
deteriorating national legal systems

1238
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,760
which make it much more easy to

1239
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
prosecute activists

1240
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,880
for

1241
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,640
doing righteous things

1242
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,720
so yeah i think that's

1243
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,359
i totally predictable

1244
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,280
outcome of what of what's happening now

1245
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,160
and we should look out for

1246
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,800
wonderful answers thank you very much um

1247
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,240
do we have any questions from the

1248
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,160
internet

1249
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,800
any more questions from the audience

1250
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,040
now is your chance free legal advice no

1251
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,800
it's not legal advice i'm not legal i

1252
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,920
don't know i don't ask people

1253
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,160
all right well if there are no oh yeah

1254
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,680
come up come up to the microphone please

1255
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,599
can you hear me yeah so yeah so i'm

1256
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,760
actually polish and i'm also a

1257
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,079
journalist security trainer so i am

1258
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,760
incredibly incredibly interested in both

1259
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,040
of those things and

1260
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,200
would you say that so you mentioned that

1261
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,599
the protest laws were

1262
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,319
essentially enforced much more severely

1263
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,560
during the pandemic yes

1264
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,760
uh

1265
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,960
yeah in poland there's other things

1266
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,200
going on as well but say in slovenia you

1267
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,800
can really see that

1268
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,240
the advent of like covert restrictions

1269
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,079
really gave license to the gov the then

1270
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,760
government in slovenia to go wild and

1271
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,000
prosecute anyone for

1272
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,079
doing anything i mean in poland the

1273
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,079
problem

1274
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,760
the problem it was already there before

1275
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
kovalev

1276
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,240
no i was just curious if like you saw

1277
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,400
that the governments were using covet as

1278
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,079
a sudden ramp up for it and now that

1279
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,480
kovit is gone well sorry when i say

1280
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,319
covetousness the restrictions of god

1281
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,760
made no no like for some of the

1282
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,119
governments like the health ministries

1283
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,839
are literally acting as if covet is gone

1284
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,160
and has the

1285
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,839
covet-related

1286
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,839
protest bans are they still being

1287
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,760
enforced or not

1288
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,680
um well it's quite a big

1289
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,960
general

1290
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,319
uh

1291
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,079
question i think you know in

1292
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,440
general i mean a lot of those

1293
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,119
restrictions have now been lifted but

1294
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,720
it's normalized

1295
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,959
sort of

1296
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,720
against gatherings of people in

1297
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,720
particular countries

1298
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,640
things have you know stayed bad

1299
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,480
afterwards

1300
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,400

1302
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,760
questions from the internet

00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,280
no all right

1304
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,800
any further questions

1305
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
are you moving towards the microphone

1306
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,480
for a question excellent

1307
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,319
all right um let's

1308
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,359
sorry

1309
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,280
the person in the back was first stay

1310
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,480
stay safe we have time

1311
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,160
uh so do you know of any slabs where the

1312
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,160
people have accidentally been found

1313
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,480
guilty of the charges so i mean the

1314
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,599
charges are uh are completely untrue but

1315
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,560
has that ever happened

1316
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,000
yeah i'm sure it has happened here you

1317
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,319
get one of the measurement problems that

1318
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,400
where if people have found guilty it

1319
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,160
people are often looking when people are

1320
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,599
trying to measure slaps they're often

1321
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,760
looking for lawsuits which get rejected

1322
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,520
and they're often looking for civil

1323
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,400
lawsuits and one of the sort of wider

1324
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,560
problems wider problems here and say the

1325
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,599
particular problem that a lot of

1326
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,280
activists are facing you know sort of

1327
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,599
the on-the-ground activism is the use of

1328
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,359
criminal charges even minor criminal

1329
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,520
charges like misdemeanors which often

1330
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,000
don't get put into those statistics and

1331
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,280
look i'm not knocking the people who

1332
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,599
have put the stats together because

1333
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,040
it's a bit of a task and like they've

1334
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,319
been doing it for the first time you

1335
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,079
know first time as well and you know at

1336
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,160
the result of a lot of work to try and

1337
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
assemble an evidence base but yeah for

1338
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,839
sure there's a there's a lot of um

1339
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,200
i mean anyone who's done activist

1340
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,520
support will know will know this right

1341
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,800
that

1342
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,200
particularly if say you're getting

1343
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,560
prosecuted in a area or region of your

1344
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,200
country where the pro bono legal network

1345
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,280
is less well developed you're much more

1346
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,520
liable to be found or you're a lower

1347
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,400
court whilst often those verdicts on

1348
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,640
reports go unreported in official stats

1349
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,280
anyway you're much more likely to

1350
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,040
get a raw deal

1351
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,319
okay thanks from camera one one one more

1352
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,760
quick question and a quick answer

1353
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,599
oh i hope it's quick

1354
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,440
i was wondering about that ricochet

1355
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,359
messenger

1356
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,319
so you compared it very shortly to

1357
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,800
signal i was wondering

1358
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,880
if it also uses uh something similar to

1359
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,359
the signal encryption protocol to

1360
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,319
provide plausible deniability uh on the

1361
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:31,839
encryption level

1362
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,760
so uh richard i am and with friction

1363
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,319
refresh kind of depends upon the

1364
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,480
the fact that onion services themselves

1365
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,040
are encrypted so it's basically uh built

1366
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,880
entirely on the

1367
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,160
uh encryption of tor to work

1368
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,960
so there is no actual like encryption of

1369
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,760
the

1370
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,400
uh data stream itself within the app

1371
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,760
but because it's going through towards

1372
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,000
encrypted and has all those

1373
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,880
nice nice guarantees associated with

1374
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,760
okay traffic

1375
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,920
all right um lots of questions that's

1376
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,240
always good um thank you very much for

1377
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,480
your interest i'm we are unfortunately

1378
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,319
out of time so i would like to ask you

1379
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,400
to give another one wonderful round of

1380
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,160
applause for our excellent speakers

1381
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,720
thank you very much

1382
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,400
you
