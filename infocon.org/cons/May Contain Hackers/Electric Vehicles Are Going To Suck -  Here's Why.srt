00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,560
my name is jenny list

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,480
i write for hackaday i'm an electronic

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
engineer and technical journalist member

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,240
of several hackerspaces and i'm also

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,439
here with an organization called

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,320
stitching trans rescue foundation

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,160
we get transgender people out of dodgy

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,840
parts of the world

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,039
so without further ado

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,600
without further ado let's start the talk

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,600
now

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,399
i don't have a car at the moment because

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,960
i was made homeless in 2020 and when i

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
moved i actually passed on my cars to uh

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,440
friends my my modern which is volkswagen

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,840
polo 20 years old went to

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
my cousin's kid who's a vox enthusiast

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,920
will take care of it and my classic

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,199
which is the 1960 tribe herald 948 went

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
to the son of a friend in the herald

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,760
community because he will yet again take

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
care of it and like it

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
and i realized that

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,200
this gives me an interesting position

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,439
i've had cars all my life i drive you

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,479
know i'm i enjoy spannering cars

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,920
and

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
for the first time in my life i don't

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
have a car because where i live i don't

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
actually need one but i do want to have

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
a car and i realize that

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,159
nowadays

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,960
you have to understand that

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
probably fossil fuel cars have had their

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
day and my next car will have an

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,400
electric motor and

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
i want it to be a really good car i want

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
it to be

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,439
have an incredible range i want it to be

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,680
efficient i want it to be spacious i

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
want it to be the best car i've ever had

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
and

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,159
what's the point it'll almost certainly

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,680
be a new car

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
it probably won't be an electric version

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,680
of some previous car where they whipped

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,200
out the internal combustion engine and

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
dropped in a an electric motor it will

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
be

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,520
a

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,000
fresh start and this is a fresh start

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
for the automotive industry that cars

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
have developed over the last hundred

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,520
years and they picked up a lot of

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,239
baggage along the way and so i want my

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,480
electric car to be genuinely

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
different probably the best car i've

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,599
ever owned

60
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,238
so hang on

61
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,239
if you drive a car

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,160
now

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,239
particularly if you drove a car 40 years

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,319
ago or so you'll notice the difference

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,120
your car now is an amazing piece of

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
engineering it will carry four people

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,120
at motorway speeds

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,040
all day

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
it won't use much fuel most cars

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
nowadays you're in the 50 60 miles per

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,720
gallon i'm afraid i don't know what that

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
is in liters per hundred kilometers but

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
they don't use much fuel

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
um

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
it won't rust it'll last a long time

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,319
it's metallurgy and rust protection is

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,000
fantastic it's oil with synthetic oils

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
in the engine your engine just doesn't

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,159
wear out now if any of you have owned

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,159
classic cars or any of you started

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,319
arriving career decades ago but it

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,959
wasn't the case when i started driving

83
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,599
which is nearly over 30 years ago now

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,799
um

85
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,400
cars rusted

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
you know we if you had a 10 year old car

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,959
or a car over 100 000 miles in a lot of

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,280
cases you're doing quite well because

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,959
you had 20 50 multi-grade oil and what

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,280
passed for steel and paint work in the

91
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
1970s so it wasn't uncommon to see

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,239
five-year-old cars rusted out in a

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,440
scrapyard

94
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,120
you remember all those adverts with a

95
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
car driving through the surf and looking

96
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
hey this is a car for adventurous people

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
you would not want to own that car

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
afterwards because that much salt it

99
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
arrested by the time it got off the

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
beach

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,879
so nowadays make no mistake if you think

102
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
your car isn't very good

103
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
compared to what it was it's amazing

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,560
but

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
how did they get this good

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
now

107
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
i don't know if any of you have driven a

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,959
fiat 127

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
i'm making a controversial statement

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
here

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,040
in most cases this car here is the

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,279
ancestor of your current car because

113
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,440
most cars nowadays have a transverse

114
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
engine at the front front wheel drive

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
and the gearbox on the end of the engine

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
there are a few outliers like say the

117
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
citroen traction avant from the 30s

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
there was front wheel drive with the

119
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,840
engine in line there's the mini mini

120
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,600
fans will probably jump up and down we

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,800
did it first but alec is put the gearbox

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
underneath the engine and shared the oil

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,440
with the engine the fiat 127 or possibly

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,720
though i think there was an inaccenti

125
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,600
came just before it was the first what i

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
would say is the first modern car they

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,199
stuck the gearbox on the end of the

128
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,720
engine gave it front wheel drive made

129
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,600
the first modern super mini you don't

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,479
drive a fiat 127 but you drive its

131
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,880
spiritual successor you almost certainly

132
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,400
drive one of these

133
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,120
now the fiat 127 we used to own one a

134
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,440
really really good little car trust me

135
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
if there's anybody from the italian

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,199
embassy here nobody makes small cars

137
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,919
like the italians they're brilliant

138
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,960
however

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,880
sorry italian friends particularly in

140
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,360
the 1970s my god nobody made cars like

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,840
the italians did

142
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,720
these cars were famous for rusting and

143
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
everything broke

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
i actually about 10 years after this one

145
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
was made um my panda my one of my first

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
cars were fiat panda the old boxy fiat

147
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,440
panda and i always say it's the best car

148
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,280
i ever owned and the worst car i ever

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
owned it's the worst car ever owned

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
because everything broke

151
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
it rusted through the bulkhead all the

152
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,440
plastic things broke it's also the best

153
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
car i ever owned because it's a small

154
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,039
italian car it's like having a little

155
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,720
dog with a ball saying play with me play

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
with me

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,520
it's got a digital accelerator it's

158
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,080
either on or it's off so you hoon around

159
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,400
the roads in a hail of revs and you have

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,160
incredible fun when you're early early

161
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
20s like i did but

162
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
a lot of cars in the 70s were pretty

163
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
awful

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,520
and

165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,440
manufacturers realized this that their

166
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,360
cars weren't lasting 10 years and people

167
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
were getting sick of it people weren't

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
buying cars because they rusted and so

169
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,080
they put a lot of effort into

170
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,639
making their cars better the engines got

171
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,560
better the metallurgy got better the oil

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
got better they went to great efforts to

173
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,360
rust proof this picture i don't know if

174
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
any of you recognize this this is

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
actually an audi advert from the late

176
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
1980s

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
it's i think an audi 80. and the whole

178
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,720
premise of the advert was this

179
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,319
billionaire has his super yacht in

180
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,639
monaco he instructs his captain that he

181
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,000
wants the car

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,400
so the captain loads up the crane and

183
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,919
the car is being winched over but

184
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,599
something goes wrong and the car lands

185
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,360
in the sea and the whole point of the

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,280
advert is but that's okay because it's

187
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
galvanized it won't rust

188
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,880
and this shows just how much

189
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,599
manufacturers in the 80s what lengths

190
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,880
they went to

191
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,520
to say our cars don't rust our cars last

192
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
this is when cars started to become

193
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,800
really good rather than

194
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,919
almost good i mean i remember early 90s

195
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
fiat when they launched the fiat tipo

196
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,520
the 90s fiat tipo its big selling point

197
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
was it was the first fiat with

198
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,639
galvanized uh body panels because fiat's

199
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,120
had this dreadful rust

200
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,120
relationship

201
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,880
so

202
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
if cars are so good

203
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,240
why have they got baggage why are they

204
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,919
all so or so bad

205
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,440
now i'm going to illustrate with a

206
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,960
procession of cars

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,800
this is a triumph herald 948 from 1959

208
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
this isn't my car but i drove one of

209
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,879
these for about 25-30 years

210
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,199
my car is as i say with my friend's son

211
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,599
at the moment he's really enjoying it

212
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,080
and this is a very old-fashioned car

213
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
it's one of the last british cars made

214
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
with a separate chassis

215
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
and the point with this car is it's

216
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,759
horribly unreliable all sorts of things

217
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,440
break it rusts

218
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
but the flip side of that is there is

219
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,680
nothing on that car

220
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
even nowadays there aren't many parts on

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,599
that car that cost more than 100 euros

222
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,039
most most parts cost 10 euros

223
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,000
and you can repair that car in almost

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
anything with a very simple set of

225
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,319
spanners and screwdrivers i know because

226
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,240
there's almost no part of a triumph

227
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
herald i haven't taken to pieces

228
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,760
and so this is on one respect a very bad

229
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,880
car

230
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
but on another respect it's a very good

231
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,559
car because you can keep them running

232
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,679
for 60 years with minimal effort i know

233
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,560
because i've done it

234
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
let's move forward

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,080
i've put 1983 there that's 1992. i am so

236
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,440
bad that is a volkswagen polo 6m it's uh

237
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,959
it's basically they had the golf mark

238
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,440
one then the golf mark ii then the new

239
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
golf mark iii was a much larger platform

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,160
so they renamed the golf platform the

241
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,040
polo and kept on making it

242
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,839
this is a car from the early 90s it has

243
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,800
some characteristics in common with the

244
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,320
herald it's actually quite possible as a

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,160
geek to repair one of these in your

246
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
garage there are a lot of electronics in

247
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,640
there but there's nothing too difficult

248
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
to deal with

249
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,040
it's got a catalytic converter it's got

250
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,519
electronic ignition it's got oxygen

251
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,440
sensors and stuff like that but you know

252
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,720
if you're prepared to learn about how

253
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,480
those work you can fix this car

254
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,519
this is a focus c-max

255
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,640
this is actually the first car i've

256
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,920
shown you where i haven't actually owned

257
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
one or driven one uh this

258
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,320
i use this one because my friend

259
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,120
has one uh it's a people carrier from

260
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,640
the mid-2000s

261
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,000
and i always remember the first time i

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
sat in it it was the first time i'd sat

263
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,959
in a car

264
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,720
where the experience of turning the car

265
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,279
was of it booting up

266
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,040
this thing at least i don't know if this

267
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,880
one here but uh

268
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,440
my friends focus c-max the whole thing

269
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,160
in front was a tft and you literally got

270
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
a logo a boot logo and i strongly

271
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
suspect if you delved in behind you'd

272
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
probably have a linux prompt now when

273
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,320
she had it it was actually a little old

274
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
so everything was starting breaking

275
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
and

276
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,959
everything was all in one computer

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,680
and to be honest from a repairability

278
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,440
point of view and a complexity point of

279
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
view this thing is not repairable

280
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
you will see

281
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,560
60 year old triumph heralds around

282
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,600
you will probably at the moment see 35

283
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,240
year olds volkswagen golf mark twos and

284
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,000
polo 6 ends around

285
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,720
i'd be very surprised if you see any

286
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,279
focus c-max is more than 15 or 20 years

287
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,279
old there'll always be somebody has one

288
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,880
but

289
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,519
they've managed to make a car that is

290
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,320
brilliant in every way it doesn't rust

291
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
its engine goes on forever you can go to

292
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,079
the moon and back if you change the oil

293
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,760
regularly in one of those

294
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,839
but they won't make more than 10 or 15

295
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,720
years old because that digital dash will

296
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,959
break

297
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,680
and this is the problem facing car

298
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,839
makers that they've made incredible cars

299
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,360
but they don't want them to last forever

300
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
they want them to die they want to die

301
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,160
early

302
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
and so i've used the phrase complexity

303
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,640
as the new rust basically when i when i

304
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,680
started my motoring career basically we

305
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,519
all had cars that were about 10 years

306
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,360
old but they were rusty as anything and

307
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,279
we got to know body filler and all the

308
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,200
tricks to get them through the apk the

309
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,040
mot in the uk

310
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
um but nowadays

311
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
you have a 20 year old car and it's just

312
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,440
rust free this is a miracle but that's

313
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,639
really bad for the car manufacturers so

314
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,320
they've basically

315
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,399
upped the complexity

316
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,279
where

317
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,600
if something broke in the herald it

318
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
would cost you

319
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,600
10 pounds 15 euros and

320
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
a day with a screwdriver if something

321
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,360
breaks in the c-max you'll take it to

322
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,600
the dealer and they will say well that

323
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
that's that module will cost you 1500

324
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,839
euros and that's more than the car's

325
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,399
worth and so you scrap it so if you go

326
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,959
into a modern scrapyard you will find it

327
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,839
is full of

328
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,480
cars that back in the 80s when i started

329
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,279
driving we could only dream of

330
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,519
cars with perfect engines

331
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,079
perfect bodywork that are only in there

332
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,160
because something too complex and too

333
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,199
expensive has broken

334
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
so here we are in 2022

335
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,399
the problem with electric cars is that

336
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,560
electric car is fundamentally a very

337
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
simple piece of kit

338
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,519
if you want to see how simple an

339
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,079
electric car can be

340
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,320
if you go around these hacker camps

341
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
you'll probably see hacky racers if you

342
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,600
see my friend mike's little tykes uh

343
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,760
cozy coupe thing driving around that's a

344
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,079
hacky racer that's an electric car

345
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,720
strips to its essentials now that is not

346
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,959
road legal but it's a good illustration

347
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,040
of what you need for an electric car

348
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,560
you need

349
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,000
a

350
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,079
floor pan platform so you need something

351
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,120
with wheels suspension brakes etc

352
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
you need an electric motor and a

353
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,760
transmission

354
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,000
you need a motor controller

355
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,880
you need a battery manager and probably

356
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,160
you need something to manage the

357
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,639
interlock brakes that's three computers

358
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,560
three microcontrollers and you can make

359
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
a road legal electric car

360
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,480
motor controller

361
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,760
power management and anti-lock brakes

362
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,199
the trouble is these are not the

363
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,040
electric cars we're getting i mean if

364
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,839
you drive an electric

365
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,760
car i'm guessing that you quite like the

366
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,519
toys

367
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,839
you fire up your tesla even your nissan

368
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,279
leaf whatever tfts everywhere

369
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,160
you know toys you didn't pay for some

370
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
heap of shites with like just one dial

371
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,519
you paid for the experience

372
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,560
and

373
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,839
the trouble is

374
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,240
particularly with things like tesla's

375
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,079
teslas go out of support before they're

376
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,600
10 years old

377
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
tesla's actually teslas also have awful

378
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,360
build quality i think i would prefer a

379
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,040
hugo to a tesla because i actually

380
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,000
prefer a car with build quality

381
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,240
um

382
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,399
and the problem is we're repeating

383
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,279
exactly the same problems as we did with

384
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,600
the petrol cars beforehand that we're

385
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,079
producing zero tape tailpipe emission

386
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:34,959
cars

387
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,079
that

388
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,000
won't be put off the road by emissions

389
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,519
legislation

390
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,360
and so the manufacturers are making damn

391
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,839
certain they come off the road by

392
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
loading them with unnecessary features

393
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,199
and integrating the features so when the

394
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,120
technology dies

395
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
the car dies

396
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,519
and

397
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,000
i would prepare to put i would be

398
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,560
prepared to put money on it if i were to

399
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
walk into a scrap yard

400
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,560
in let's say 2030 or 2035 i would find

401
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,680
it full of nissan leafs and teslas and

402
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,240
e-golfs and

403
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
oh god what's the other

404
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
your normal crop of current day

405
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,920
electric vehicles that are in perfect

406
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
condition they still have plenty of

407
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,160
capacity in the battery they have no

408
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,360
rust

409
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,959
you could they look as though you could

410
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,480
drive them away

411
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,360
but

412
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,720
they will be dead and they will be in

413
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
the scrapyard because

414
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,079
some

415
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
loaded extra feature has died which

416
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,519
costs a fortune to replace and the owner

417
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,440
has just said i'm going to scrap it

418
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,360
and thus

419
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,600
i'd say that when environmental

420
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,639
soundness is linked to longevity rather

421
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,839
than to tailpipe emissions

422
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,440
an electric car that lives for less than

423
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
10 years or even less than 20 years

424
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
isn't environmentally sound at all i

425
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
mean i think i'd rather go a more

426
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,519
environmental route um i'd hazard a

427
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,639
guess that

428
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,680
driving a diesel pickup truck fueled by

429
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,000
endangered whale oil would probably be

430
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,560
more environmentally sound

431
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,880
oh geez there it goes

432
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,240
help

433
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,959
with that yay

434
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,079
so

435
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,360
coming back to what i said about the

436
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
hacky racers

437
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
an electric car this is this is actually

438
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,639
a prototype ford electric car from about

439
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,199
1914 and as you can see it's an extra

440
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,839
car strip to the minimum personally

441
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,199
looking at that it's got brakes on the

442
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,040
back wheels only and it's got lead acid

443
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,800
battery and it's got no safety features

444
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,079
whatsoever maybe that's a bit too

445
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,279
minimalist

446
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,079
but

447
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,279
really it comes back to what i was

448
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,759
saying about the hacky racers

449
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,519
to make an electric car you do not need

450
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,680
all the extra things it's a genuine ex

451
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,880
opportunity for manufacturers to throw

452
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,199
away the baggage and make much simpler

453
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,920
cars with longevity in mind if they're

454
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,079
serious about

455
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,920
environmental soundness

456
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,839
they need to look at the way they make

457
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,799
cars and make them

458
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,760
for lifetime environmental soundness not

459
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,599
just the smug feeling of the first

460
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,959
person who drives it off the forecourt

461
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,959
so

462
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
is something i came up with for hackaday

463
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,919
a while back the minimal

464
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,079
motoring manifesto

465
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,720
which is this is how i want to see cars

466
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,919
made

467
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,600
i don't know if you not agree with me

468
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,960
i'm guessing they'll probably be one or

469
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
two automotive engineers in the audience

470
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,160
who will tear me to shreds in the

471
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,919
comments but this is a hill i'm prepared

472
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,559
to die on

473
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
personally i would like to step into a

474
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
car something like a willis jeep with

475
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,720
one dial in front of me and minimal

476
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,799
controls but i realize not everybody is

477
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,000
like me

478
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
right people expect the toys they want

479
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,120
the toys they've they've earned the

480
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,679
right to the toys so yeah fair enough

481
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,679
you should have toys in a car if you

482
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,880
want to

483
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
but car design needs to be able to

484
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
deliver the toys

485
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,678
without

486
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,559
without delivering that built-in planned

487
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,720
obsolescence or one thing breaks and the

488
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,240
whole car is scrap

489
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
so here's the manifesto

490
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,520
separate the subsystems

491
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
why

492
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,000
are unnecessary subsystems integrated

493
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,440
closely with necessary ones

494
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
why when something that is unnecessary

495
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
for the car breaks

496
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,799
do i have to replace a module

497
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,440
which costs a fortune because it runs

498
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,760
every other subsystem on the car why

499
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
when something unnecessary on the car

500
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,760
breaks can i not just ignore it and keep

501
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,320
driving and keep going for an apk and

502
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,720
keep or mot and keep

503
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,480
the car on the road

504
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,440
when my triumph heralds

505
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,720
trouble is the trunk herald is a bad

506
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,600
example because it has no toys okay when

507
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,559
my polo 6m's air conditioner died or

508
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
other or central locking died or any of

509
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,640
its other subsystems

510
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
and believe me all its subsystems did

511
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,240
eventually die

512
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,840
i could keep driving the thing because

513
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,679
it still had enough of its subsystems

514
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,320
separate that it kept on the road the

515
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,480
speedometer worked the lights worked

516
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,880
whatever

517
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
that focus c-max

518
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,280
if almost anything dies

519
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
anything affects that um can bus

520
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,880
whatever the whole bloody lot dies

521
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
and

522
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
when you've had the experience of seeing

523
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,320
somebody

524
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440
with

525
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,840
a headlight bulb that's broken and it's

526
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,440
not just a headlight bulb like it was in

527
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,880
the triumph herald it's a

528
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,640
computer system and there's a

529
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,480
microcontroller in there that's died so

530
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,919
they're stuck with no headlights by the

531
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,160
side of the road you start wondering

532
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,080
maybe complexity is the enemy of the

533
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,400
motorist

534
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,080
the next thing on the manifesto is

535
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,240
provide a minimal weigh-in

536
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,679
now we're all familiar with obd2 um most

537
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,039
of us have probably got on them little

538
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,799
bluetooth dongles you plug into your car

539
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,919
and you can read off all sorts of

540
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,400
interesting stuff now obt-2 is great

541
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,720
it's a standard because some parts fit a

542
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,000
standard now of course every

543
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
manufacturer has extended the standard

544
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,919
and made it non-standard

545
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,720
i would suggest i would like to advance

546
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
the

547
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,600
proposition that we need a standard for

548
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,200
essential

549
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
services in a car

550
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,360
so if something very expensive dies and

551
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,280
means that you can't get it through an

552
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
apk you need to be able to unplug that

553
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,600
digital dash or that module and throw it

554
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,919
away and drop in an open source one that

555
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,840
provides the essential services needed

556
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
throw away the toys just put in an open

557
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,600
source speedometer or whatever that just

558
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,080
works

559
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,840
but it comes down to the last one is

560
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
if you read

561
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,799
reviews of mobile phones

562
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,320
i mean i know this i'm a journalist when

563
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,679
you're writing a review of something you

564
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,919
need to find something to get excited

565
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:00,799
about

566
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,559
and i actually pity people who review

567
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,720
mobile phones because all mobile phones

568
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
are basically the same they're a black

569
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,440
slab

570
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,880
i mean even if this is actually quite

571
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,039
galling if you basically if you pay a

572
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,880
thousand euros for an iphone you get a

573
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,200
black slab if you pay 50 euros for an

574
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,360
alcatel you get a black slab and they

575
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,120
look absolutely identical from a

576
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,880
distance and as a journalist when you're

577
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,159
writing about this stuff you've

578
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,000
basically got to sort of find the things

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,520
that you can say oh the iphone is so

580
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,600
special because it has a curved edge or

581
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
something stupid but it's basically

582
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
sorry it's a black slab and this is the

583
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,400
same problem with cars that

584
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
there was a time when cars were all

585
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
different

586
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,480
i mean if you go back to the 1970s you

587
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
could genuinely if you wanted a car with

588
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
a rear engine there were several ones if

589
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,320
you wanted a car with adventurous

590
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,760
styling there were several ones if you

591
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,480
wanted a rear-wheel drive car you could

592
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,400
take a choice

593
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,360
but

594
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,000
to be honest now you look at the models

595
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,039
from the main manufacturers and

596
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,120
you can't get a cigarette paper between

597
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
them they're so similar and they're all

598
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
very bland

599
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,919
and

600
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,000
when you read reviews and things the

601
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,240
reviews are all about the toys in the

602
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,720
cab because the poor journalist has got

603
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,320
nothing else to write about because the

604
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,880
car itself is so boring

605
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,520
and i would turn around and i would say

606
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
if you're a designer of cars

607
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,240
you need to go and drive a 1950s car and

608
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,200
find what makes a car fun to drive

609
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,360
without bells and whistles

610
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,280
because if you can make a car that

611
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,440
doesn't need all the extra crap you've

612
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,400
probably made a better car in the first

613
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,799
place

614
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,600
a friend of mine

615
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
used to had a basically he's tried to

616
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,280
start a business in kit cars and it

617
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,400
failed

618
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,120
and he came to me and he said that the

619
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,360
car business you're one of either one of

620
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,039
two types of people you're either a

621
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,280
crook or a dreamer

622
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,440
now i'm not in the car business but i

623
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,240
realized that this the thesis i've just

624
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,840
delivered makes me a dreamer because

625
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,679
it's never gonna happen it's not in the

626
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,679
interests of car manufacturers to make

627
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,600
cars that last longer they want to flog

628
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,559
cars

629
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,320
but still

630
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,640
if we're living in late stage automobile

631
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,760
design the automobile is about to

632
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,080
change and shuffle off this mortal coil

633
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,520
as we know it

634
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,840
we still don't have to like it

635
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,320
anyway i've been jenny list if you like

you first okay thanks yeah thank you it

654
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,919
was very interesting i drive an electric

655
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:20,720
car

656
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,279
i had been researching which car to

657
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,880
drive for months

658
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,360
and and ended up leasing for for the

659
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,880
first time in my life because there

660
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,279
wasn't the perfect car yes

661
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,799
um

662
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,080
so but i was wondering do did you hear

663
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,120
about the sono motors car with

664
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,200
which comes only in

665
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,120
one variety variety and has

666
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,679
photovoltaic system sorry can you repeat

667
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,400
the make of the car so no motors s-o-n-o

668
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,480
okay is that the one that looks a bit

669
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,960
like a volkswagen micro bus

670
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,679
i yeah i think so it is it's you can

671
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,520
just get it in black

672
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,880
and uh it has solar panels all around

673
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
and their

674
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,880
their goal is to make a simple car

675
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,320
have you heard about that that is a

676
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,000
wonderful idea i've seen more than one

677
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,080
attempt to do that however i'll refer

678
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,679
you back to the crooks and dreamers

679
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,320
slide yeah i

680
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,120
would love to drive a car like that but

681
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,440
all the ones i've seen i may not be

682
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,880
quite familiar with the one you've

683
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,480
described but all the ones i've seen are

684
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,960
either way more expensive

685
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,520
or the company basically isn't going to

686
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,000
belong to this world i really want a car

687
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
like that and if i could get one that's

688
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
great but

689
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,600
i'm afraid

690
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,240
i would end up paying a lot more money

691
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,120
than i can afford and i might well end

692
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,960
up with something with zero spare

693
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,200
support because companies gone bust

694
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,279
yeah yeah actually i'm not sure if they

695
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,760
are getting ready we had reserved one

696
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
and it's delayed delay delayed and i've

697
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,320
heard mixed things things so i was

698
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,840
wondering if you know about it and what

699
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
europe well i may not be familiar with

700
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,520
that particular one but i've seen quite

701
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,000
a few they're also actually i'm a

702
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,799
motorcyclist as well as a driver and

703
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,880
they're also some very exciting small

704
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,120
motorcycles in the sort of one two five

705
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
cc class and it's not impossible as a

706
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
lifetime lifelong car driver and

707
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
motorcyclist i might actually become

708
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,320
purely a motorcyclist

709
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,840
for the same reason because there are

710
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,240
some simple ones there yeah yeah thank

711
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,400
you

712
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,720
hi there hello

713
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,960
i won't shred you to threats because i

714
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,840
really like your talk thank you

715
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,960
i always bought old cars and i did a lot

716
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,720
of repairs on them

717
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,559
until indeed the cars became too

718
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,200
complicated to do it myself and recently

719
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,360
a lock failed and i had to like the

720
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,559
ignition lock and i had to pay 400 euros

721
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,840
because it had to be reprogrammed i was

722
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,880
amazed

723
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,039
um

724
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,840
i kind of fell over

725
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,000
like complexity is the new rust whether

726
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,880
it's the

727
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,120
the intention of the manufacturers to

728
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,840
make a car that is

729
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,039
very

730
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,799
obviously very soon

731
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,799
because i i'm wondering whether i mean

732
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,320
you're blaming the manufacturer but i

733
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,559
think the manufacturer is also driven by

734
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,799
us as consumers

735
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,279
so the my question is is the deliberate

736
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,200
choice of the manufacturers or is it

737
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,159
lack of critical consumer feedback

738
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,640
i would say there's an element of both

739
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,799
because of course the consumer because

740
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,640
the trouble is the consumer

741
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,720
as in you and i is different from the

742
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,279
consumer buys the cars because people

743
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,360
who buy new cars they don't buy them for

744
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,039
the same reason we do

745
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,200
and yes you're right the consumer just

746
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,440
wants toys but the manufacturer is

747
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,919
consciously making cars that are bad for

748
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,840
maintenance the manufacturer is

749
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,640
consciously making cars with software

750
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,000
licenses the manufacturer is consciously

751
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,039
selling

752
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,200
freaking heated seats as a service or

753
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
whatever other stupid ideas the

754
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,520
manufacturer is enthusiastically

755
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,679
embracing this so i'm still going to go

756
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,000
with the manufacturers here

757
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,399
yeah but if you look like a fair phone

758
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,640
to look at the phone side i mean they

759
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,399
kind of try to do what you're suggesting

760
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,279
okay to make it modular like okay

761
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,360
i'm going to answer that though outside

762
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,200
this field

763
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,760
who has a fair phone

764
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,919
yeah exactly

765
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,919
you know i mean great there are there is

766
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,640
a fair phone but the fact is that

767
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
virtually nobody outside our community

768
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,159
has heard of it

769
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,080
uh so i would say that fairfax you're

770
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,320
right fairphone are doing the right

771
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,919
thing but they are a very niche

772
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,880
manufacturer yeah so if huawei start

773
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,039
doing that then i'm listening but i

774
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,240
would say that some that approach great

775
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,600
but i don't see any of the big

776
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,039
manufacturers doing that yeah and that's

777
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,720
why i think that's just

778
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
to take this discussion offline and uh

779
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
please give the thought to the next

780
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,840
question thank you

781
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,080
go on

782
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,279
hi there hello so first of all

783
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,880
i would like to thank you for addressing

784
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,039
this because i think it's a real

785
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,279
issue especially when the population is

786
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,480
growing and

787
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,000
more and more people want or need cars

788
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,880
at the same time

789
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
i would like to ask

790
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,200
because this still revolves around

791
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,840
car ownership because you have a car and

792
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,000
at some point it stops working and you

793
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,919
need to repair it or

794
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,080
buy a new one

795
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,240
and

796
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,120
now

797
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,880
hypothetically

798
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,320
um if there would be a future where car

799
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,960
ownership isn't the norm because most

800
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,840
cars

801
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,080
they are produced then they are in

802
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,440
parking lots

803
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,640
for over 90 percent of the time

804
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,480
which is kind of a waste resources i'd

805
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,279
say

806
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,799
so

807
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,159
what if

808
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,799
cars would not be personal

809
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,600
property but rather be a service people

810
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,159
can make use of would that change the

811
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,799
conclusion of your thesis well it would

812
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,440
still mean that those cars if they're

813
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,279
over complex would go on the scrap heap

814
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,200
quicker which basically means that they

815
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,640
are less environmentally sound so it

816
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
doesn't it doesn't change the what you

817
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,720
might call the hardware part of the

818
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,679
thesis but also

819
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,200
it's the same thing with cloud software

820
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,720
when i pay for something i want to own

821
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,840
it

822
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,240
i don't want somebody else to own it

823
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,600
and

824
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,840
fair enough i use gmail because i mean

825
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,640
geez this is a google presentation um

826
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
but

827
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
there are things where i draw the line i

828
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,679
want to own something i want to own my

829
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,159
cad package i don't want it in the cloud

830
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,440
thank you autodesk eagle um

831
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,399
i want to own my car because i don't

832
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,399
want somebody else to harvest my every

833
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,799
use of it and select somebody else i

834
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,120
don't want

835
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,679
to be beholden to a

836
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,320
evil corporation on it so there's

837
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,000
there's the hardware side of it that it

838
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,559
doesn't matter who owns the car if it's

839
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,159
on the scrap heap in five minutes that's

840
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,279
a bad thing but there's also the

841
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,919
ownership side of it that

842
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,399
i want to

843
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,000
i want to be able to use my car on my

844
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,720
terms also i grew up

845
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,519
it come out in brits a borderline i grew

846
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,279
up on a british farm

847
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,840
and these kind of shared models sort of

848
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
cars as a service they're great if you

849
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,200
live in a town

850
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,600
but most people don't

851
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
and

852
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,200
most people don't live in the kind of

853
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,039
town that has that kind of thing if you

854
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,360
live in a hollow hollowed out town in

855
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,279
the hinterlands you're not the first

856
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,880
people to get these services you're the

857
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,960
last people to get these services so

858
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,120
there's still a big lead for people to

859
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,200
have vehicles they own

860
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,240
i would say

861
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,159
but from a hardware perspective i would

862
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,000
say the same completely applies whatever

863
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,880
the ownership model is if the car

864
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,360
is on the scrap heap before it's time

865
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,919
then it's not sound yeah fair enough

866
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,159
thanks

867
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,080
hello um

868
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,919
i'd like to disagree with you

869
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,360
please do and well first i think

870
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,519
we're having a people problem as you

871
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,880
said to the questions before uh

872
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
people want gadgets

873
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,799
you shouldn't be angry at car

874
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,880
manufacturers but you should be angry at

875
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,000
people that just want to live with it

876
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,360
or try to change and educate people to

877
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,039
to be more uh sensible of this thing and

878
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,240
i'll take you on the 2 20 30 bet

879
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,559
i'm sure there will be

880
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,880
not many cars in perfect condition in

881
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,960
scrapyards

882
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,559
and another thing sorry um

883
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,880
cars are pretty resilient like in a

884
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,919
tesla you can remove the center mcu and

885
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,799
you

886
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,799
lose the air conditioning and some

887
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,120
commodity features the car still runs

888
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,559
i came

889
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,399
when i came here i was playing with a

890
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,679
can bus over tesla yeah and i shorted

891
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,600
the uh motor control bus canvas and it

892
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
still drove fine

893
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,159
until and it just disabled regenerative

894
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,279
braking

895
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,000
uh but there are also many open source

896
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,399
projects that are addressing this like

897
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,240
there's uh open source uh as you said uh

898
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,559
speedometers yeah like an extra android

899
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,640
with an esp32 connected to the can bus

900
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
that works

901
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,320
and i'm sure there will be a driving

902
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,720
community for this kind of project which

903
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,440
aims to remove vmcu and make the car

904
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,880
number

905
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,200
as you like it but

906
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,120
i think it's also

907
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,279
a generational problem like people with

908
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,600
carburetors were complaining when uh

909
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,159
inject injection got introduced

910
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,279
and

911
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,559
it's also

912
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,480
yeah you know the

913
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,600
the world is

914
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,840
more and more complex every day so

915
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,320
everything is more and more complex uh

916
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,480
it's like entropy but

917
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,079
uh

918
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,760
it's still accessible you can still root

919
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,839
a tesla you can still reverse engineer

920
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,199
the can bus

921
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,960
it's just more difficult i would turn

922
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,520
around on the first point um i'd say

923
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,759
that

924
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,520
it comes back to that separate the

925
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,839
subsystems thing that

926
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,520
fair enough the customer asks for the

927
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
toys the manufacturer is not separating

928
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,320
the subsystems but also i would say that

929
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,000
yes there are all these open source

930
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,480
projects and they are absolutely great

931
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,800
the trouble is they are not accessible

932
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,320
to the kind of people who are not on

933
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,760
this field

934
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,000
and it's great yes it gets more complex

935
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,760
but if you basically have to be the kind

936
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,199
of person who goes to hacker camps to

937
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,359
even attempt it it's failed

938
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,639
basically

939
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,320
that triumph herald

940
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,920
as i say in a lot of ways was an awful

941
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,720
car

942
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,960
but almost anybody

943
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,920
in his backyard with a screwdriver could

944
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,839
maintain it now obviously we have moved

945
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,560
on since triumph heralds but you want to

946
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,359
go halfway to making it easier for

947
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,280
somebody who isn't on this field and i

948
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,960
agree there are some wonderful open

949
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,400
source projects

950
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,240
but

951
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
i have an electronic engineering degree

952
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,839
i can do this

953
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,800
but

954
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,760
i don't think it's fair to expect

955
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,960
the average bloke on a estate in my

956
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,359
hometown of vista to also be able to do

957
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,680
it yeah but where there's a wheel

958
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,000
there's a business so if many people

959
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,680
want this uh the people from the open

960
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,599
source project will manufacture that is

961
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,440
sure to just plug in there are many

962
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,480
projects

963
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,839
this way we've had these things for

964
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,520
quite a long time and those businesses

965
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,359
haven't appeared and meanwhile

966
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,800
yeah there are a few businesses like

967
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,280
that but it's not a mass market thing

968
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,040
so yeah but this please move the

969
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,119
discussion to outside and give room to

970
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,680
the next question and by the way uh if

971
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,960
we come along to wtf 2020 sorry 2033

972
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,320
there's a club martyr in that bet

973
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,040
hello

974
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,920
hey a very quick one maybe

975
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,040
um

976
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,119
we are adding the complexity to these

977
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,119
systems to the cars

978
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,000
to increase the safety

979
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,720
so in the 1970s

980
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,640
the car that you just show

981
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,359
we had about 20 000 people dying in

982
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,560
germany alone in roadkills a day a year

983
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,599
sorry

984
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,839
now we have about two thousand

985
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,480
yeah so we are saving what eighteen

986
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,400
thousand lives

987
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
a year

988
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,680
i mean we can reduce

989
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,640
airbags we can reduce esps we can reduce

990
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,079
all of these microcontrollers all of

991
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,440
this logic

992
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,359
right now we are adding all the compute

993
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,119
to the to the cars

994
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,720
to save lives

995
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,119
i would disagree with you there are also

996
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,359
obviously a lot of technology in the car

997
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,160
for safety there is the

998
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,720
design of the monocoque there is the

999
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,680
metallogy of the monocoque there are

1000
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,078
things like crumple zones there are

1001
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,520
reactive systems like airbags and stuff

1002
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,680
like that for sure but

1003
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,400
it the kind of things i'm talking about

1004
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,200
are not the essential safety systems

1005
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,320
they are

1006
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,560
the

1007
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,800
ludicrous amounts of extra complexity

1008
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
and non-essential systems that is tied

1009
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,960
into the rest of the car of course we

1010
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
need safety systems

1011
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,200
oddly that triumph herald is actually

1012
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
one of the safe cars i featured there

1013
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,680
because it has a separate chassis there

1014
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,079
is um

1015
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,320
a test data on

1016
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,119
a

1017
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,760
1970s crash test on a triumph spitfire

1018
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,200
in which it actually came out quite well

1019
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,599
because the chassis just go yink but

1020
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,800
that's an outlier

1021
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,320
so yeah safe safe safety is obviously an

1022
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,160
important thing but i'm not talking

1023
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,480
about safety systems here

1024
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,720
because it's not the safety systems that

1025
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,279
are the problem

1026
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,800
any other takers

1027
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,800
come on this is a hill i'm prepared to

1028
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,480
die on come at me you know

1029
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,680
well if that's all then thank you very

1030
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
much and thank you for being a polite

1031
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,910
and attentive audience

1032
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,450
[Music]

1033
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:41,069
[Applause]

1034

you
