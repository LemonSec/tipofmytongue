[Music]

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
collecting and preserving um historic

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,720
artifacts of the computers that were

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,560
before now

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,920
becomes more and more interesting

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,279
because the people that could actually

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,240
operate them are

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,599
disappearing

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,960
um

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,520
what it takes to put build up a museum

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,600
how to operate it how to finance it how

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,640
to

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
make it happen

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
um is something that our next speaker is

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,079
going to talk about probably i would

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,079
assume from what i've seen so please

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,399
give a very warm welcome to beth van aka

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,760
thank you

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,520
so i i don't know if i'm going to walk

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,440
so maybe i'll walk or maybe i don't know

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,480
yet uh yeah as i said as my introduction

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,559
i'm my name is bart and i'm the founder

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,559
of the home computer museum

24
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,000
we're based in helmand in the

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,960
netherlands and uh we have actually

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,920
mission

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,000
so we stayed at a mission for ourselves

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,159
it's on the screens right now and it's

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,920
not this one is flickering but

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,840
uh preserve and share the history of the

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,560
home computer uh for and with current

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,040
and future generations

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,520
that's what our mission is which means

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,560
we have a lot of computers

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,840
so let's see if this works does this

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,360
work that doesn't work

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
okay i have to walk

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,159
so how it all started

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,159
i said i'm bart

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,560
and i'm a collector

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
and this message is approved by my

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,159
therapist i can now freely talk about it

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
that i am a collector

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,439
well actually

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
as you can see on the pictures

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,840
this is how my garage looked back in

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
2016.

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,759
no if a car didn't fit at all

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,079
i used i'm a drummer so

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,640
i created my garage was used to be a

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,878
studio i insulated and everything

52
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,920
but

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
it ended up in 2016 that my drum set was

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,680
permanently permanently in my car

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
because it didn't fit in my garage

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,879
anymore

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,800
actually um

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,160
i even had

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,640
computers stuffed in my wife's walk-in

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
closets so it was crazy how much

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
computers i had

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,879
however

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
at this moment i don't call myself a

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,599
collector

65
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,480
for the simple reason

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,280
a museum director cannot be

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,959
a collector

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,800
a collector is doing nothing then

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,120
collecting and a museum director should

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,440
do something else than collecting at

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,400
least in my opinion

72
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,720
so

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
as said in 2016

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,239
i got the idea of a computer museum

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,319
and the reason i got the idea is because

76
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,280
i visited two museums one in england and

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
one in the netherlands

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
both museums had the problem it was no

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,440
interaction at all

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,239
meaning that the computers were off or

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,440
not working or and a computer i mean

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,680
it's just an object it's

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,760
not supposed to be nice i guess there

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
are computers that really are supposed

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
to be nice but most computers are not

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
supposed to be nice

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,519
they're objects to work with

88
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,840
so why present them in a way that

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400
they're not used to i mean

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,239
computers should be working right that's

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,799
my opinion

92
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,959
i didn't see any stories

93
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,959
i didn't have a limited information

94
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,959
about a computer but other than that

95
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,720
there were no stories why is this

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
computer made who were the people using

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,080
those computers

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
that was that was what i found

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,519
interesting about a computer i mean

100
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,239
computer is just a thing with plastic

101
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,319
and metal and all that stuff that's in a

102
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,599
computer

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,400
but more interesting is the story behind

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,799
the computer why is a computer made why

105
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,400
who were the people using those

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,879
computers and i missed that all in the

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,360
museums i visited

108
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,519
also i found in one museum

109
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,959
i won't call it name but it's in england

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,959
i found misinformation

111
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,360
i mean if you see an amiga 1200 and the

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,000
sign says amiga 500 you do something

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
wrong

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,680
if you see attendee trs-80 and it says

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
created in 1979

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,400
that's also wrong it's 1977.

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,560
and i know that as a collector

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,440
but

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
people who are not collectors and people

120
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,800
who are not very deeply interested in

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
computers or know about the history of

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,800
computers go to a museum and see this

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,080
information and assume a museum is right

124
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,400
and that's really bad

125
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
i actually from the same museum i got a

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,880
book which is even worse they actually

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
printed a book very expensive book and

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,040
there's information inside which is

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
wrong

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
there's an amiga thousand

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
stated all information about an amiga

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
thousands and they printed an amiga 500

133
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
i mean how hard is that to correct the

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,479
the right computer

135
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120
so that has to be changed in my opinion

136
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
as a collector i came to these museums

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,720
and was like

138
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,759
this has to be changed

139
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
so first thing i did was try to

140
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
collaborate

141
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
i tried to collaborate with the museum

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
in the netherlands

143
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,600
to say okay i have this

144
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
you have don't have information it's

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,560
you don't have the stories can i help

146
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,720
you can i help you in any way

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,680
to

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,759
give you the information or to make it

149
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,160
nice to make it a visible museum that's

150
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,199
not only for collectors like like me or

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,080
maybe people here but also for for my

152
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,759
wife

153
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,919
she should enjoy it as well

154
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,160
um i tried to but

155
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,520
it was no use i couldn't he didn't want

156
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,880
to at all he's i i yeah i don't like

157
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,800
saying it that much but i think he's a

158
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
hoarder

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,960
it's all his and it's not he's not able

160
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,600
to to share his information

161
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,120
so that didn't work out

162
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,080
and i wanted one thing to do something

163
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
that actually matters and help people

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,319
there's a little bit of history about me

165
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,919
i have a sister who is who has autism

166
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,919
and it was discovered on a

167
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,840
pretty late age he was 20 and then it

168
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,919
was discovered that she was she had

169
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,759
autism

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,280
and before that before that age he was

171
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
just a heart learning child that's how

172
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
it called back then

173
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,720
so in 20 years i had experience with one

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,039
somebody with autism

175
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,800
without any label on it without a

176
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,199
sticker that says you have autism

177
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,240
and

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,039
when

179
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,479
it was discovered

180
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,319
i had a girlfriend as he studied

181
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,759
psychology

182
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,800
and i was really interested because i

183
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
all my life i was helping my sister so

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,160
when it was discovered and my girlfriend

185
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
at that time was studying

186
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
psychology i think i thought i should do

187
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,479
that too

188
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,759
it was my thing however i was studying

189
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,800
if my technical information so studying

190
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,240
computer stuff

191
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
and i figured okay i should finish this

192
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
first before i do something else

193
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,759
but

194
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,319
i think i'm smart so what i did was just

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,199
read all the books from my girlfriend

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,840
try i have a little bit of a head start

197
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,880
already

198
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,039
so i did that

199
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,000
but yeah i didn't do that at all the

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
reason is the relation ended and my

201
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
girlfriend at that time

202
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,520
she changed a lot and apparently if you

203
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,240
study psychology the first two years of

204
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,400
your life will be

205
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,879
finding your own problems and try to fix

206
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,319
that

207
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,720
she never returned from that so instead

208
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
of finishing her study she actually

209
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,000
ended up

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,639
in a closed

211
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
hospital

212
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,199
she's now fine again i guess i don't

213
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,360
have much contact with her but that was

214
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
also one of the reasons

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,199
maybe i shouldn't do that i was happy

216
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,919
with my life at the time so yeah don't

217
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,319
try to you know poke in and

218
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,879
try to fix me because i was fine

219
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,319
so yeah

220
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,960
however i became a system administrator

221
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,160
uh

222
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879
got into linux i actually did security

223
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,479
for a while as well

224
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,159
but i ended up with voiceover ip

225
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
and in my work i found a lot of people

226
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,599
doing exactly the same as my sister was

227
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,958
doing

228
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,120
having a form of autism

229
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,839
and i also noticed

230
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,680
that a lot of managers a lot of

231
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,920
companies don't know how to act with how

232
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,880
to

233
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
respond to those people it's a lot of

234
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
communication it's only about

235
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
communication

236
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,880
and

237
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,360
um so in in i

238
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
accidentally

239
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,839
tried to be in between a short middleman

240
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,399
without i was a system administrator but

241
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,480
i try to be the middleman i try to help

242
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,839
those people

243
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,480
to have this miscommunication fixed

244
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,080
as i say i speak i speak fluently autism

245
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,160
because i have 20 years of experience in

246
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,959
that

247
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,959
so actually helped a lot of people

248
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,880
staying in the company

249
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,839
and

250
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,640
instead of you know calling in sick

251
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
not being on time anymore

252
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
not doing their job and eventually lose

253
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,600
their jobs

254
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,080
i i kept a lot of people from that and

255
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
i'm pretty proud of that

256
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
um

257
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,920
so yeah this was i wanted to do that as

258
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
well when i started with the museum i

259
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
wanted to help people and

260
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
apparently in the i.t i couldn't do that

261
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,560
that much

262
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,480
so that was also one of the reasons i

263
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,080
started the museum

264
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
and the third

265
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,640
reason

266
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,480
my wife asked me

267
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,959
as i said i had my the walking closet of

268
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,200
my wife was stuffed with computers and

269
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,959
she didn't like that anymore

270
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,600
i'm also i'm i'm i used to be a musician

271
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
i'm still a musician uh playing in bands

272
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
and all kind of stuff

273
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,079
and also doing business

274
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,240
so i tried to make a company from a band

275
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
so i was just doing the strange things

276
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,440
like being a bookings agency and being a

277
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
band and making it a company so my wife

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,279
was used to me being away for like 75

279
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,800
weekends

280
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,079
or else

281
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,720
mostly every weekend i was away with

282
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,200
bands and i quit with that because

283
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,279
children

284
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,959
so um

285
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,720
yeah and then i suddenly was home and my

286
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
wife would have yeah you have a bunch of

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,880
computers in the garage i had 35 back

288
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,560
then you have a bunch of computers you

289
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
go to all these fairs and you go to the

290
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,560
meetings and gatherings of old computers

291
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
why don't you do anything with that

292
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,800
because i was used to do you know making

293
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,839
companies

294
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,600
not that successful but i was making

295
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
companies so yeah my wife was one of the

296
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,399
the causes as well to create this museum

297
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,480
so yeah that

298
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,839
that was the plan

299
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,360
let's make a museum

300
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,519
because why not

301
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,399
i mean

302
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,480
i was here and nobody else was doing

303
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,800
what i was thinking of so okay let's do

304
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
that

305
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,560
so but

306
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
a museum is a terrible business plan

307
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
i mean i don't know if there are any

308
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
people from companies in here but or any

309
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,440
managers directors or anything founders

310
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,320
but a museum is a terrible business plan

311
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,959
it depends on external money

312
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,599
i mean every

313
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,959
company

314
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,160
that is

315
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,560
relying on external money is not a good

316
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,519
company especially if it's only one

317
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,360
i worked at a company that had one big

318
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,440
customer and that customer was saying

319
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,680
maybe we should shop for another one

320
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,279
yeah that was a problem

321
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,600
uh i don't want that and i see a lot of

322
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,519
museums

323
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,240
completely relying on external subsidy

324
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
on external money money they don't

325
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,880
make their own and

326
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,120
i don't think that's a good idea because

327
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
if you have external money that means

328
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,160
somebody else is making decision if they

329
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,399
give you money and what if they decide

330
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,519
something else

331
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,680
what if they decide okay no we're not

332
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,279
doing that anymore so let's do something

333
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
else and then you suddenly have no money

334
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,920
and you are relying on it so your

335
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,760
company goes down

336
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,279
now

337
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,200
it's always non-profit

338
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
which is not a problem but most people

339
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
think if it's non-profit it doesn't it

340
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,600
means no revenue

341
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,279
and that's wrong

342
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
a museum is a company so it should have

343
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,440
revenue in my opinion

344
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
it bets a good will goodwill of people

345
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,519
volunteers you name it it depends on

346
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,839
people trying to help you

347
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,399
which i i loved i don't say you

348
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,120
shouldn't but it is one of the facts

349
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,200
and most museums it's not a business

350
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,399
model it's like okay we have subsidy we

351
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,560
ask for subsidy we ask for money we ask

352
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
for funding

353
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,040
and we just you know put a lot of stuff

354
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
in make it nice make information

355
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,120
and that's it

356
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,279
and we'll keep it going as long as the

357
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,120
money flows in but

358
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,959
there's no business models no retainable

359
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,440
business model in that

360
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,440
so

361
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,839
so i wrote a business plan because it

362
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,240
was a terrible idea

363
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,079
that's how i am so this is actually a

364
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,480
screenshot of my business model

365
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,040
of my laptop of this one but

366
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,480
i made a photo of my i don't i don't yes

367
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
so the business plan

368
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,800
what version 1.0

369
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,880
and i can tell you it's still 1.0 we

370
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,480
haven't changed

371
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,079
it should be an interactive museum

372
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,800
computer should be on working they are

373
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,320
tools to be

374
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
used so museums are working plus

375
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
if a computer is working

376
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,560
it will stay alive

377
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,480
everybody here knows that if you keep a

378
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,399
system off for a long long time the

379
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,839
batteries will die

380
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,680
and eventually batteries will leak

381
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,279
capacitors will die

382
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,720
and leak

383
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,480
hard disks will fail especially the

384
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,120
rotating ones they will fail

385
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,920
rubber will just you know completely dis

386
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,000
dismantle and and

387
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,760
meaning that it can't be read anymore it

388
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
can be used to to read data

389
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
so

390
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
interactive means computers should be on

391
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,240
computer should be working meaning the

392
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,399
life will be prolonged

393
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,639
simple as that all electronics should be

394
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,639
on because it makes their life longer

395
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,639
we should be independent i don't want to

396
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,639
be dependent on anything

397
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,320
i don't want to be dependent on money

398
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,240
external but also i don't want to be

399
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,560
dependent on me

400
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
because

401
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,839
i will die eventually

402
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,680
not planning to but yeah something

403
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,360
happens and i will die

404
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,680
and if i die should the museum then

405
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,440
dissolve that's weird right so now we

406
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,519
should continue so we should have

407
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,600
something independent of as that as well

408
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,120
i want to help people with autism

409
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,959
one of the main reasons i started i

410
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,199
wanted to help people

411
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,920
i wanted to have good storytelling

412
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,760
people should have a good story to to

413
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,839
walk through have a good story

414
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,880
to

415
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
to read and have all the information

416
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,279
i'll do a lot of research as well

417
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,360
find the information but is this

418
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,519
information we can find is that correct

419
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,360
information or is it just bogus

420
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
quite recent example

421
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
one of the museums

422
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,600
stated on june 5 this year that apple

423
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
existed for

424
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,560
the apple now the commodore pet

425
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,079
was released

426
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,199
45 years now 45 years ago yeah something

427
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,440
like that the commodore pet was 45 years

428
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,079
ago on june 5th

429
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,480
was 1977 the commodore pet was released

430
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
according to them

431
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,959
but

432
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,880
if you did a little bit of research you

433
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,240
know it's wrong

434
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,639
because the apple ii came out on june

435
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,880
5th the commodore pet came out in

436
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,839
october that year so

437
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,079
quite a shame

438
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,560
we should have future proof i've seen a

439
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,319
lot of museums fall down

440
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,759
doing you know a museum is is is dying

441
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,240
people uh there are museums that that do

442
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,440
things that

443
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,399
nobody is using anymore and nobody is is

444
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,000
you

445
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,399
is actively remembering

446
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,480
obviously a castle yeah it's not that it

447
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
will dissolve suddenly but yeah it

448
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,560
should be future-proof it should be able

449
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
to continue for at least 100 years

450
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,800
by itself

451
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,399
not depending on external money et

452
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,079
cetera et cetera

453
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,240
and we have a clear focus because

454
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
calling it a computer museum is quite

455
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,680
broad

456
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,480
right you need the big ibm 360 and as400

457
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,560
and you need a lot of building for that

458
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,399
a lot of space especially if you want to

459
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,119
have it interactive i don't

460
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,880
you need the sort of power supply that

461
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,119
you have here over in this entire camp

462
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,160
it's not fun plus people i don't i don't

463
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,839
think people really remember working

464
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,919
with an as400

465
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,640
yeah some of them

466
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,319
so i had a clear focus and i wanted to

467
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,000
have a museum about the home computer

468
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,319
computer that people used at home

469
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,679
there wasn't any

470
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,559
at least not in europe

471
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,760
so

472
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,679
i came up with a business

473
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,360
plan

474
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
consisting of

475
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,480
three pillars

476
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,160
as i call it

477
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,000
the first pillar

478
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
is collection

479
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,160
so we have a collection part

480
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
showing everything that uh we can do

481
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,160
anything with the collection uh

482
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,400
collecting itself obviously showing it

483
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
going to fairs going to

484
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
mch

485
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,720
care is helping people

486
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
helping people with autism helping

487
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,280
people with the distance to the labor

488
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,039
market because we broaden it a little

489
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,799
bit in the years but

490
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,760
care is

491
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
helping people just helping people going

492
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
back to work

493
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,679
and commercial

494
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,200
we also have a commercial

495
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,400
branch

496
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
and commercial meaning we do services

497
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,160
because

498
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,720
where we can do in the museum

499
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,360
uh think of uh data recovery

500
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,799
reading old media

501
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,440
something like that nobody yeah

502
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
who can read the five and a quarter inch

503
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,640
here

504
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
yay

505
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,559
good zip disk

506
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,520
see

507
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,440
jazz disc

508
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,039
still

509
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,480
very good

510
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,720
but if you read the data

511
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
if you have the data what can you do

512
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,679
with it

513
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,640
can you open it in something modern

514
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,600
maybe

515
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
maybe not and that's why we come in

516
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,200
because we have all these old computers

517
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
working with the original software so we

518
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,400
can just open it in the original

519
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
software

520
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
so that's commercial

521
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,080
we also offer repairs

522
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
since we want an interactive computer

523
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
museum

524
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,960
we have to have knowledge of all these

525
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,200
computers right

526
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,520
so we have to repair them because most

527
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
of the computers we get

528
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,679
are broken when we get them

529
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,799
or will blow up if we try to use them

530
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
so we have to make make sure we can

531
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,000
repair them

532
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,240
but why only use it internally why not

533
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,080
use it externally

534
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,160
so that's exactly what we did we just

535
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,320
opened the computer repair shop

536
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,160
and in these times a computer repair

537
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,240
shop by itself is not really feasible

538
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,720
anymore it's not a business

539
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,080
unless you do it like huge but yeah

540
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
nobody is going to a shop to repair the

541
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
computer anymore it's just you you know

542
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,320
you return it throw it away whatever or

543
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,679
repair it yourself

544
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,280
but you don't go to the shop anymore

545
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
it's not the 1990s anymore

546
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
or 80s so

547
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,280
yeah we do that and we still have a lot

548
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,880
of people you know don't know how to

549
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
reinstall windows yeah sure we'll do

550
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,039
that or reinstall a mac but also

551
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,880
commodore 64 that's broken

552
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,080
we also repair that and we always repair

553
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,919
we never replace

554
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,919
we try to not to replace but

555
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,240
obviously if we have to spend six hours

556
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
to repair a commodore 64 then you could

557
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,760
probably get another one that's probably

558
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,880
cheaper than

559
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,200
and no q no pay

560
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
simple as that

561
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,600
there's also commercial stuff we also

562
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
sell computers all refurbished computers

563
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
it's also what we sell old laptops

564
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,960
business laptops we sell them

565
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
one of our biggest

566
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,400
uh

567
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,039
customers is called stifting leg health

568
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,400
it's a foundation

569
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
that gives laptops to poor families

570
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,360
poor family that has a child obviously

571
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,440
that goes to school and needs a laptop

572
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,679
but can't they can't afford a laptop

573
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,400
so

574
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,320
we give them a laptop

575
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,520
and that foundation pays us it's 150

576
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,600
euro not much

577
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,440
but what's what we do

578
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
also the social service the

579
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
work agency

580
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,679
if you have a

581
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,679
somebody who's unemployed and needs to

582
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,360
follow a course for their work for their

583
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,559
new work

584
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,559
and don't have the money to buy a laptop

585
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,840
there we are again we can provide those

586
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,520
laptops and since march this year we

587
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,400
also do that for ukrainian refugees

588
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,240
and nobody's paying that for us but we

589
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,960
just give them away somebody comes in

590
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,510
we give them away

591
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,600
[Applause]

592
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
and apparently we're the only one in the

593
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
netherlands who does that because we're

594
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,559
in helmand which is pretty south but we

595
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,159
get them from all over the netherlands

596
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,200
people from ukraine come to the museum

597
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
to get a laptop

598
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
and it's a it's a normal laptop it's

599
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,360
just you know second to seventh

600
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,159
generation core i5 so core i7 so they're

601
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,080
really decent laptops we install windows

602
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,559
10 on it or windows 11 if they possible

603
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,360
install english ukrainian russian

604
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,919
languages so they can use them and

605
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,600
there's warranty on it as well they

606
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,039
return it if it's broken and we just

607
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,919
repair it it's that simple

608
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,520
thankful we have a lot of companies

609
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,640
sponsoring laptops to us for that

610
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
especially for this reason

611
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
and we also sell them so you can also go

612
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
to the museum and buy a laptop it's

613
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,360
always below the 300 euro

614
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,679
because we are there are shops nearby

615
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,640
that sell chromebooks for 300 euro

616
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,679
we know these chrome booths are crap

617
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,400
but

618
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,559
a normal consumer goes either a new

619
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,480
laptop or a secondhand laptop for 300

620
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,159
they go for a new one

621
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,679
then six months later they're returned

622
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,440
to us because their laptop is broken but

623
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,240
that's another story

624
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
so that's that was the business plan

625
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,799
and i wrote it down i just did that yeah

626
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,880
you saw it i just made a word document

627
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,960
and i wrote it down and back then i was

628
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,559
still using open office i guess i don't

629
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,480
know

630
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,360
so that was the end of 2016

631
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,720
and then 2016 17 started

632
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,080
i had a plan

633
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,880
but i need a building

634
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,200
and it needed to have some requirements

635
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,679
i mean we can't just have a building for

636
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,919
a standard house it has to be a good

637
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,039
building

638
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,840
and i wanted to have a specific in the

639
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
city center i didn't want to be on an

640
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,559
industrial area or so

641
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,000
the reason is i

642
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,360
and the reason is

643
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,720
um

644
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,919
museums

645
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,760
why on an industrial area it's it's

646
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,600
really hard to get

647
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,679
to usually they don't have a train

648
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,120
station nearby or you have to go with a

649
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,320
bus

650
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,120
secondly if i go to an industrial area

651
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,360
it means i have to provide food

652
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,400
for people sounds stupid but people come

653
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,480
in and they stay for a few hours

654
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,039
hopefully and maybe they're hungry

655
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,679
so that means i have to provide food

656
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,799
and

657
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,120
i'm not a cook

658
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
so no i don't and i don't want to spend

659
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,679
money on that so no

660
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,440
i stay in the city center

661
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,000
if somebody's hungry go outside there's

662
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,240
plenty of food over there

663
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,679
that's their job

664
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,400
so i wanted to be in a city center

665
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
and i wanted to rent

666
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
not

667
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,480
anti-crack i don't know in the english

668
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,840
term but temporary so if i don't didn't

669
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,039
want to

670
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,960
what the simple reason again

671
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,320
i don't want to have a three weeks

672
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,919
notice

673
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,320
so like you have to three weeks and you

674
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
have to get out of the building

675
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,559
that's not very nice to have in a museum

676
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,520
right

677
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,279
especially if you know how many stuff we

678
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,760
have now it's not fun to move anymore

679
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
really

680
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,320
so i came i had this this idea i wanted

681
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,200
to have a decently sized building

682
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,919
at first i asked for 1500 square meters

683
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,720
but

684
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,120
yeah they didn't have that

685
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,960
so as to the city city of helmand

686
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
because i reside in the city of helmond

687
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,600
and

688
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,000
yeah why nude so i go into the city of

689
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,279
hamilt

690
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,880
and they had a plan they had a big

691
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,960
building in in their minds

692
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,200
uh where they could host four museums in

693
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,799
there were two other museums in

694
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,640
helmholtz that were getting out of their

695
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,919
building because their building was

696
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,279
teared down

697
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,080
um and they thought of the idea okay we

698
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,159
have this two build two museums and then

699
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,240
the home computer museum and they found

700
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,720
something else for a museum great great

701
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
idea good business plan one big building

702
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,799
multiple museums i think it was a good

703
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,000
idea

704
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,480
but yeah it was the the city city

705
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,799
council is not going to work

706
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,640
they didn't and they

707
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
just put in more build more people and

708
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,840
more

709
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,880
eventually i think we were 15 companies

710
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,320
in the same building and the building

711
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,480
wasn't any bigger it was a building that

712
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,760
already existed

713
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,080
and was empty for a long long time

714
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,720
so yeah i ended up with like maybe 100

715
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
square meters i was like now it's going

716
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,960
to happen

717
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,440
uh but yeah the city was still you know

718
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,880
this is going to happen this is going to

719
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,919
happen

720
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,520
so um

721
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
at some point i remember it was in

722
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,840
october and uh i was talking with with

723
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,240
one of the the people from the city

724
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
and she said to me

725
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,120
maybe you should start already

726
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,039
with the museum

727
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,480
so okay

728
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,679
i was like yeah sure let's do that

729
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,880
and now

730
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,679
uh we still speak a lot

731
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,640
she meant back then that i should start

732
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
promoting it on the internet but i was

733
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
already ahead of that i was already

734
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,520
doing that at the time so

735
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
my key was okay i have to rent the

736
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,960
building

737
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,320
so i did i rent the building

738
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,880
i didn't want to rely on anything so i

739
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,600
just started i just went ahead make some

740
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,799
phone calls

741
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
and found an empty building

742
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,600
500 square meters in the city of helmand

743
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,080
and it was

744
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,880
that's me

745
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,200
these are screenshots from youtube so

746
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,120
yeah so this was an empty building it

747
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,200
was completely empty

748
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,480
no power

749
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,919
no floor

750
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,080
it still had a wall in middle in the

751
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,320
building

752
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,640
and it was empty for multiple years

753
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,480
used to be a solar

754
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
thing

755
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,159
sunbathing studio or something and they

756
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,399
went bankrupt and they just removed

757
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,720
everything that was copper so you can

758
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
imagine that all cables were just

759
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,799
stretched off so it was

760
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
a mess inside

761
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,640
um so we got this building uh by the end

762
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,399
of 2017

763
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,159
we got the key for building we went into

764
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,360
the building

765
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,120
we found out there was no floor

766
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,440
so we called up the com the owner of the

767
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,360
building and said there's no floor how

768
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,960
can i use this

769
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,200
all right there's a floor yeah

770
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
okay we will make it sure that you get a

771
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
floor oh perfect

772
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,679
so i figured out

773
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,080
let's do six weeks from now

774
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,240
so i calculated six weeks or something

775
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,360
like that

776
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,320
um so i calculated a few weeks and

777
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,520
um i came up with 17 march of the 17th

778
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
2018.

779
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
that will be our opening day

780
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,320
so i put it on the internet and somebody

781
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,520
else would i put it on the internet

782
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,720
we're all going to open we have a

783
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,919
building and we're going to open on

784
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,240
march 17 2018.

785
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,919
cool

786
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,279
but the

787
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,399
building owner wasn't that fast

788
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,279
actually she was so slow if they were so

789
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,320
slow

790
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,559
that 10 days before

791
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,240
our opening

792
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,360
they pulled down the floor

793
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,520
and there was no electricity there was

794
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,880
nothing in there

795
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,919
so in 10 days we built a museum

796
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,120
and i don't know if this is going to

797
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,880
work

798
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,080
yeah maybe

799
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,679
maybe it's work yeah that's me

800
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,039
again

801
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,600
so i i'm going to skip through it easy

802
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,720
because

803
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,320
can i skip through it

804
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,480
no yes not

805
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,440
now i can't get to it

806
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,679
can i script no i can't skip

807
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,760
i don't have any sounds i don't need

808
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,480

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,720
so i'm not doing this because

848
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
yeah i'm a museum director so i will

849
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,440
tell i will talk i can talk for hours if

850
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,679
i if you're ever in a museum don't ask

851
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,720
me to do a tour because i can talk for

852
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,000
eight hours and yes i did that already

853
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,320
so anyway that's a

854
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,600
as you can see it's

855
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,799
very empty

856
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,200
and the lights it was just

857
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,120
this was with one screw the lights were

858
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,519
bolted to the to the concrete into the

859
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,880
ceiling

860
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,760
uh

861
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,919
there were cables hanging everywhere but

862
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,320
we managed we were open

863
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
on march 17.

864
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,960
we were open with 25 computers that were

865
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,919
working

866
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,440
oddly enough all the computers from the

867
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,000
90s were broken but we were open with

868
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
all these computers

869
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,919
at that time i had about 400 computers

870
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,960
in stock

871
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,880
and they were scattered around in

872
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,039
several storage units and in my garage

873
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,320
at home and

874
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,559
but we had with 25 computers working we

875
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,320
were open and

876
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,760
people could enjoy and we had a great

877
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,679
day that day

878
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,080
and i slept a few days after that but

879
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,279
um

880
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,600
yeah we had 10 days of building

881
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,640
uh

882
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,120
and we started and in um

883
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,360
by the end of 2018

884
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,519
i'm still holding nothing but end of

885
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,080
2018 we were nearly bankrupt

886
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,519
because we didn't have any budget at all

887
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,320
uh

888
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,559
the total budget we had at the time was

889
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,519
25 000 euros not dollars

890
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,279
euros

891
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,840
that was about 10 000 of my personal

892
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,519
money

893
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,200
and the rest of the sponsors and the

894
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
city that give a bit of money that was

895
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,720
it

896
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,159
and again

897
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,799
no electricity so we had to really do

898
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,799
every electricity we had to go from the

899
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,480
from the the

900
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,519
box

901
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,279
all the way and we had to do with with

902
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,440
high power and it was it's crazy there

903
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,120
were no lights

904
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,640
we had to pay for that there were no

905
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,919
walls

906
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,559
just to make a nice there was nothing

907
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,640
but we managed to do it for some somehow

908
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,320
um

909
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,120
but by the end of 2018 yeah we were we

910
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,720
were nearly bankrupt actually we were

911
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,240
bankrupt

912
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,679
on paper

913
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,679
but since we were still communicating

914
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,159
with the people who are we owning money

915
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:56,880
to

916
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
um they kept us open

917
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,799
and they they kept those because we were

918
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,559
still you know asking everybody asking

919
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,640
the city to help us out because

920
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,720
there were no no nothing of visitors we

921
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,960
didn't have any budget to make to make

922
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,760
any commercial outings or anything there

923
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,039
was nothing

924
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,360
so we were just sitting in

925
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,760
and we didn't know anything and

926
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,960
um i was really

927
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,600
in doubt of throwing the towel in the

928
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,279
ring i was just you know giving up

929
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,399
almost

930
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,360
um but my my other founder

931
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,200
patrick said

932
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,760
you can't stop now you've become you

933
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,720
came so far and you can't stop

934
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,360
also i did i still stopped working

935
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,559
because this museum took up all my time

936
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,000
i stopped working i didn't have any

937
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,519
income anymore

938
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,600
i didn't have any benefits i just

939
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,039
completely stopped

940
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,279
and um

941
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,320
yeah so by the end of 2018 my savings

942
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,240
were completely gone

943
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,120
uh

944
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,000
i was in debt uh a lot

945
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,640
um the museum was in debt we were two

946
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,279
months or three months behind on rent to

947
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,720
the building

948
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,599
so it didn't was it wasn't nice

949
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,879
thankfully

950
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,199
another company went bankrupt

951
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,359
in the same street as we are

952
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,000
and the company at that time

953
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,800
was repairing computers

954
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,280
so we heard that we found out that they

955
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,599
were bankrupt or that the

956
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,520
the the city in the city was closed it

957
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,719
was closing down

958
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,239
the michonne for the people who know

959
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,960
from the netherlands um we heard this

960
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,119
this company was closing down

961
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,119
so we went to that to that company and

962
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,960
said i heard you're closing down and

963
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,280
told us yeah we're closing down

964
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,879
uh this morning we heard that we have to

965
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,119
go away by 12.

966
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,560
they heard that morning they have to go

967
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,639
away by 12. the entire building had to

968
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,839
be empty it was impossible to do

969
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,679
so i asked him very polite we are good

970
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,960
friends with them

971
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,119
we had an agreement they were wearing

972
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,800
the new computers we were repairing the

973
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,839
old computers that was our agreement we

974
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,720
did

975
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,959
so

976
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,480
i asked them

977
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,000
is it okay if i put up a sign over here

978
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,480
and she they said no no absolutely not

979
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,599
we are not allowed to put any signs up

980
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,960
but i'm away on quarter 212

981
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,599
and i don't care what happens after that

982
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,040
so at 12 exactly two papers on the front

983
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,359
door if you look for a pass go to the

984
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,800
home computer museum

985
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
and we picked up all repairs from that

986
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,280
shop went to the home computer museum

987
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,760
and that's how we survived

988
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,079
that was our thing that we could survive

989
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,720
so yeah

990
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,520
there's also

991
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,240
more than full our full-time work

992
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,599

actually they were made in the

1057
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,640

1059
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,640
yeah there's also katja schumann was

1060
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,079
back then

1061
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,359
some kind of famous uh girl from a soap

1062

1067
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,359
became famous and laser computer became

1068
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,960
famous lazy computers at some point was

1069
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,119
the biggest in the netherlands

1070
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,560
and

1071
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
after a while he gave up a lot of

1072
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,440
competition from the chinese market

1073
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,920
dell as american but

1074
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,880
but acer and all that kind of brands so

1075
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
he sold his company laser computer's

1076
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,520
assault in late 1999

1077
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,280
and the guy who took it over um yeah he

1078
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,359
 it up that's his simple and lazy

1079
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,000
computer's gone the thing is you

1080
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,160
couldn't find this information at all

1081
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,000
his name was completely he doesn't have

1082
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,599
linkedin he doesn't have any social

1083
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,480
media he's completely offline basically

1084
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,640
you couldn't find this information

1085
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,760
and um we have proof obviously

1086
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,480
so what we did is we let him share this

1087
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,880
story create this entire story how he

1088
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,480
became the importer of laser computers

1089
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,000
and that's what we published on our

1090
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,839
website and we are still the only one

1091
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,440
who published the full story of laser

1092
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,520
computers so that was the first story we

1093
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,720
did that in 2018

1094
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
so 2019

1095
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,040
we weren't bankrupt

1096
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,480
so that was good

1097
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,880
and we started to have a stable income

1098
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,560
because we were helping people we were

1099
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,000
helping people with autism helping

1100
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,520
people with this to the labor market and

1101
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,960
the dutch government gives money for

1102
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,680
that

1103
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,960
so we had stable income we had

1104
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,400
volunteers as well

1105
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
it was a great system and we still have

1106
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,200
that same system

1107
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,760
and we had the first contact regarding a

1108
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,280
new building because the current the

1109
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,599
building we rented was only for two

1110
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,960
years

1111
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,359
because when we started to rent it the

1112
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,760
city told us after two years we have

1113
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,599
this major building the big building

1114
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,319
with the four museums in already

1115
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,040
but in early 2018

1116
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,440
just after we opened the city decided

1117
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,920
yeah you're not coming in that building

1118
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,599
so

1119
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,160
but we had to do anything else and

1120
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,400
yeah the landlord

1121
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,240
really wasn't pleased with us

1122
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,640
because we were still behind with rent

1123
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,280
so there was no chance we could ever had

1124
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,880
a successor a longer rent period

1125
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
so we needed to have a new building and

1126
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,920
it happened

1127
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,480
that the building next to us

1128
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,880
which was much larger and a much better

1129
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,560
street

1130
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,800
was empty and we could

1131
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,280
got in contact with the land and the

1132
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,960
owner of that building

1133
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
and he was uh

1134
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,280
enthusiastic about it yeah 10 minutes

1135
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,040
great

1136
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,599
i'm still in 2019 i was still now

1137
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,640
um and we won the heritage prize

1138
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,640
that was a big one we won the heritage

1139
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,800
prize by the end of 2019

1140
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,079
uh because our combination of social

1141
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,200
cultural

1142
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,040
uh entrepreneurship

1143
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,359
that's the reason why we got the prize

1144
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,119
and it was not decided by a judge it was

1145
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,880
decided by the audience

1146
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,480
which was quite easy because they had a

1147
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,760
voting system

1148
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,839
and you ask a computer museum for voting

1149
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,839
systems yeah we can fix that

1150
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,280
so

1151
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,760
this is our new building

1152
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,480
the entire yellow part

1153
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,960
is completely us

1154
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,319
1090 square meters

1155
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,079
and we moved in by the end of 2019

1156
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,720
and we were closed for the entire month

1157
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,000
of january 2020 and we figured out it is

1158
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,839
a good day to open on the 2nd of

1159
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,720
february 2020.

1160
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,119
and we opened that day

1161
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,880
and we had a youtuber coming over it was

1162
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,400
great and a lot of people were

1163
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,960
enthusiastic about us

1164
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,240
yeah

1165
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,000
then

1166
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,680
corona and stuffs happened

1167
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,920
we moved to a new building we opened on

1168
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,839
the 2nd of february 2020 and we were

1169
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,800
closed on march the 15th

1170
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,560
yeah that wasn't a great success

1171
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,119
but since we had some time on our hands

1172
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,960
we had didn't have any visitors we

1173
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,040
started to repair on our status

1174
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,640
and our status is a dutch cut computer

1175
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,920
it's it's a

1176
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,680
really big computer

1177
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,280
and

1178
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
yeah there's not there's no information

1179
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,560
at all no schematics no documentation no

1180
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,319
pictures no videos

1181
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,440
up to then

1182
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,200
uh and we had to we took on the

1183
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,720
challenge to repair that to get that

1184
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,560
machine booting again just because we

1185
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,839
can and we had some time on our hands

1186
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,960
we saved we managed to stay afloat

1187
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,640
as a company

1188
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,560
by selling laptops

1189
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,880
we sold in three weeks more than 100

1190
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,920
laptops

1191
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,000
to the foundation that gives to poor

1192
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,400
families because suddenly

1193
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,440
home schooling became something and we

1194
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,359
had to deliver laptops it was like the

1195
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,440
mcdonald's at our place

1196
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,560
in the front they were giving out

1197
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,079
laptops in the back they were installing

1198
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,839
laptops and i was doing the the

1199
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,240
administration to send bills

1200
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,000
it's a crazy time but we in three weeks

1201
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,079
time we had uh we sold more than 100

1202
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,480
laptops

1203
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,680
um

1204
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
we started to do the dutch heritage we

1205
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,440
received an holborgen which is a dutch

1206
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,880
computer

1207
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,359
if you happen to be in the retro village

1208
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,200
we have the whole bone over there

1209
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,040
working

1210
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,480
and we started to do dutch heritage

1211
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
because the home computer stuff you know

1212
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,000
is great but

1213
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,760
we need to do more and we found the

1214
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,160
offstate s which is also dutch computer

1215
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,240
and we had tulip properties so that's we

1216
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,680
did

1217
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,280
and instead of

1218
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,119
complaining about

1219
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,400
oh it's it's terrible that we have

1220
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,040
no visitors we decided to go on the

1221
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,079
internet

1222
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,319
and we took basically we took over

1223
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,440
all social media we have every social

1224
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
media can find us

1225
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,720
except for um

1226
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,440
i've got a name yeah i might we got all

1227
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,520
social media

1228
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,440
and we are actually the

1229
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,520
by far the largest computer museum on

1230
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,960
social media

1231
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,119
by simple every day a picture with a

1232
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,000
nice story that's what we do every day

1233
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,119
so uh despite we are closed for uh four

1234
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,480
months

1235
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,240
uh

1236
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,160
not my one month view one month was

1237
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
closed because we were moving not too

1238
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,640
pandemic

1239
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,440
despite that we grow we grew in revenue

1240
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,200
we grew in collection and we grew in

1241
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,640
volunteers

1242
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,480
we grew in everything which was

1243
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,560
completely strange because we are a

1244
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,680
non-profit organization without subsidy

1245
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,480
and we grew in 2020 in a year that we

1246
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,760
everybody was complaining that

1247
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,160
everything went bad so

1248
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,839
despite that we had less visitors than

1249
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,599
in 2019

1250
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,359
and by the end of the year we had a very

1251
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,040
hard time but we were saved by the

1252
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,960
sponsors people getting a year's

1253
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,560
subscription

1254
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,839
and in 2020 we were given

1255
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,880
the largest collection boxed pc games

1256
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,440
we counted them there are 2 200

1257
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,560
pc games in our museum and we got the

1258
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,560
largest collection cdi in the museum

1259
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,400
so

1260
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,319
2021

1261
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,680
yeah i'm going a little bit faster

1262
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,040
because i'm getting out of time with

1263
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,760
we were more we were more close we had

1264
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,119
six months we were closed in 2021

1265
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,560
um

1266
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,280
we had less visitors than in 2020

1267
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,680
we became member of the network digital

1268
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,040
uh heritage nde

1269
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,160
meaning that we are now

1270
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,839
for museums and for other companies

1271
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,240
we are reading old media and converting

1272
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,079
the data to a modern format that's what

1273
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,000
we do

1274
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,440
we became an example of social

1275
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,119
entrepreneurship by the national office

1276
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,560
of cultural heritage

1277
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
so that's where we also are

1278
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,720
we got our status working

1279
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,480
and at this moment we are the only one

1280
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,920
in the entire world that have worked in

1281
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,240
our status standing and we had a massive

1282
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,640
growth on social media

1283
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,720
the only thing we don't have i i came up

1284
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,240
with the only thing we didn't have we

1285
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,440
don't have currently isn't only fans but

1286
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,119
it's only social media we don't have um

1287
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,680
yeah by the end of 2021 we were again

1288
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,359
nearly bankrupt

1289
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,520
that's that's our thing by the end of

1290
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,280
the year getting bankrupt

1291
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,920
but we're saved by sponsors donations

1292
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,480
and adoptions you can adopt a computer

1293
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,160
in the home computer museum

1294
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,760
then we make sure we give them fresh

1295
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,680
power every day

1296
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,680
that's what we do and you can pet it and

1297
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,960
you can come and visit it as well so

1298
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,200
we became an essential museum for the

1299
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,800
preserve of the national history

1300
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,359
so we are officially

1301
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,920
yeah right but

1302
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
basically we can't go bankrupt because

1303
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,119
if we are

1304
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,680
nearby bankruptcy then the netherlands

1305
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,520
will take us over

1306
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,000
and fire me but yeah that's so we don't

1307
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,359
do that

1308
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,480
again

1309
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,240
uh we crafted a lot of data

1310
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,640
yeah

1311
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,680
this year

1312
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,559
we opened the cdi collection it was

1313
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,319
planned in 2020 but yeah there was

1314
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,920
something happening in the world so we

1315
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,079
didn't open we opened the cdi collection

1316
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,000
we actually have the largest cdi

1317
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,079
collection in the entire world both

1318
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,079
hardware and software

1319
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,800
all the all the cdi's are currently

1320
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,440
are archived already and shared

1321
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,520
that's what we also do we open for

1322
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,599
everybody to come in and actually share

1323
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:04,960
the data

1324
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,359
ah three yeah

1325
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,559
he didn't tell me he had a three um

1326
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,880
on september 25th we have the opening of

1327
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,040
the game collection pc boxed game

1328
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,720
collection which is actually in the

1329
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,520
guinness world record and we will try

1330
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,920
this year to have that

1331
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,480
set again in the home computer museum

1332
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,640
because the old record says 1800 and we

1333
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,839
counted and we come up to 2200 so yeah

1334
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,200
we need to fix that

1335
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,319
mgh

1336
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,000
it was the first time for us and we love

1337
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,839
it here so we hope that we come back the

1338
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,119
next time

1339
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,280
um and i think everybody will like likes

1340
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,720
us too because we have a lot of people

1341
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,800
coming in our tent

1342
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,559
our visitor numbers are getting better

1343
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,040
and better it's not still on the place

1344
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,440
where we want to be but i think this

1345
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,720
year we'll be

1346
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,200
doing that

1347
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,319
yeah and i was already out of time with

1348
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,000
this so

1349
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,680
why are we important

1350
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,040
i think

1351
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,040
i told that pretty much

1352
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,960
we do preserve the history

1353
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,800
we actually tell the stories we make

1354
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,400
sure everything is working that the

1355
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,440
knowledge is kept how things work

1356
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,760
and what we can learn about

1357
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,520
the the history

1358
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,319
is the the speed it went we went from

1359
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,200
1977 with a computer that was four

1360
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,599
kilobytes of memory we went to a thing

1361
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,520
that yeah i mean this is a computer

1362
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,680
everybody here has a computer

1363
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,319
and what we learn in our computer museum

1364
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,440
is that every computer has its own story

1365
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,040
and we actually found that a lot of

1366
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,440
people now who are in the musician we

1367
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,520
are music industry started out with

1368
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,880
matari

1369
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,359
because we found the link between atari

1370
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,359
and becoming a musician

1371
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,960
and that's very interesting there's a

1372
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,119
lot of history to be found in the

1373
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,400
computer museum

1374
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,559
history about people history about about

1375
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,760
technology

1376
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,200

1377
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,400
