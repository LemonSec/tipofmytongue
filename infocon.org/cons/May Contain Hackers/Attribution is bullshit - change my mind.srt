2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,800
and when i first put this talk together

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,039
um well there was the idea for it i

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,160
didn't imagine i was bringing a

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,000
seven-year-old with me and of course

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,920
mummy never says bad words in front of a

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,279
seven-year-old

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,840
so when mommy says bad word

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,920
cowbell do the cowbell there we

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,079
go she can't hear

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,079
amazing and always having a cowbell is

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,079
better than not having a cowbell

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,960
okay

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,520

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,920

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,680
important i find

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,239
um i've been doing security for too long

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,799
um and still learning exit beam gives me

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,400

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,920

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,200

31

you're doing really well

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,520
okay so this is how it started

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,959
go see the dog had said something i

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,319
can't remember what it was but basically

71
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,840
i said attribution is cowbell

72
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,560
cowbell

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,120
 thank you

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,200
and uh daniel gordon said to me

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
is there a way i could convince you

76
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,760
otherwise

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,280
and there is one answer to this always

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,160
right

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,799
the answer

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,280
is cake

81
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
but here i stand cakeless

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,000
in front of you in a lovely lovely set

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
of fields here in the netherlands and i

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
don't have a cake

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,480
so we can we can consider from this

86
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
attribution is indeed cowbell

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,640
 thank you okay that's not going

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,440
to get annoying at all i promise

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,720
so here we go

90
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
attribution

91
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,640
thank you for coming to my ted talk it's

92
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,640
very easy and you just blame canada

93
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,159
good all right we're done here thanks

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,480
for coming

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
and then there's this right

96
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
this is very easy attribution if in

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,879
doubt

98
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,640
blame anonymous

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
that works

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,200
dead easy attribution's fine

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,319
you can bring the cowboys ring the

102
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,519
cowbell

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,480
anonymous there we go

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,799
so here's the thing though

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,959
we want to find blame

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,319
we like blame

107
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
i asked trinity this morning i said okay

108
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,959
imagine if you're in the playground

109
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,400
someone comes up behind you and they

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,799
push you really hard and you fall over

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,040
and you cut your knee and it's bleeding

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
what's more important

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
tending to your knee

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,959
or finding out who pushed you over

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,439
and her immediate answer was what find

116
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,200
out who pushed me over

117
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,519
i'm like but you're bleeding

118
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,000
she's like oh yeah

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,599
it's instilled to us at a young age that

120
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,000
we want to blame something someone we

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,759
want to know why who why has this

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,400
happened to us why am i bleeding

123
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
when we talked about stopping the

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
bleeding

125
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,080
and we might never know who pushed you

126
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,360
over

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,639
the bleeding becomes more important

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,919
doesn't it

129
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,800
yeah

130
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,479
so you're not wrong

131
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,240
but you know it's still cowbell anyway

132
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,440
great article here if you want to read

133
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,759
more about this but we do like to look

134
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,840
for simple answers we want to find blame

135
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,680
it's just built in us

136
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
even for seven-year-olds who are happy

137
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,759
to bleed in the answer to know who

138
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,130
pushed me

139
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,160
[Applause]

140
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,440
but

141
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,320
here are some thoughts on attribution

142
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,560
our lovely friend sun tzu cyber

143
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
is in agreement so that's good

144
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
who here likes games with dice that have

145
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,800
more than six sides

146
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
some of you do

147
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,800
i know you do

148
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
my husband does it's fine we don't talk

149
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,240
about it it's his thing i like formula

150
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
one he likes dice with more than six

151
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
sides

152
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,800
and it's hard

153
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,720
so i run this very very technical

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
scientific test here that got in

155
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,600
eventually got 18 votes

156
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
but for reasons that are important i had

157
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
to take the screenshot at this point

158
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,000
i think it ended up like 44 of my 18

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
respondents science

160
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,840
said that it was vital to their work

161
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,479
vital

162
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,400
no one explained why other than they

163
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,919
like to find somebody to blame that was

164
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,520
as close as we got to why it's important

165
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,280
a lot of folks responded to me on

166
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,320
twitter because i asked a similar

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
question

168
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
that it is indeed cowbell

169
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800


170
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
and is it because it's hard or

171
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,479
is it because actually is it

172
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,599
going to really help us

173
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,280
see what we think

174
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,199
but this is also true

175
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,120
we love a hot take i love a hot take

176
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,319
it's very easy to come out here and to

177
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,520
say something sweeping like

178
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
attribution's

179
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,680
without really doing a lot of research

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
18 people does not constitute research

181
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,039
in my mind either so let's not call that

182
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,440
science anymore

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
and it's not just a cyber problem

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
this beautiful

185
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,880
man here

186
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,280
this is a sculpture that was in the

187
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,240
getty museum in los angeles for about 10

188
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
years

189
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,639
and it was attributed to gauguin

190
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,919
because they found when they were

191
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,919
putting this they found this this statue

192
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,919
they found some pictures by gauguin that

193
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,400
he'd done of this statue and therefore

194
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,919
decided that he might as well have done

195
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,039
this as well because he's got some

196
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,800
pictures of it so

197
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,120
probably that'll be

198
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,360
but it turned out that

199
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
the plinth that it was on was a bit

200
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,639
weird was it very gal ganny apparently i

201
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,919
don't know what a gal gadon plinth looks

202
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,919
like but apparently not there was no

203
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,520
signature

204
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
so somebody decided they should maybe

205
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,639
look into this a little further did

206
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,199
gauguin really do this statue turns out

207
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,720
probably not

208
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
he was swanning around somewhere out in

209
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
the pacific being gal gown doing some

210
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
art

211
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
um and he met up with a guy there

212
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,960
who'd taken a photo of this

213
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,520
a year before he met gauguin and he gave

214
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,919
gauguin a picture

215
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,840
so we can pretty much guess although

216
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,759
maybe nobody's carbon dated the picture

217
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,960
and even that's fraught with a few

218
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,080
errors

219
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
this probably isn't but it sat there for

220
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
10 years it toured loads of art

221
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
galleries being this gal gown statue and

222
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,199
it's not probably we still don't know

223
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,080
so it's not just us

224
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
i'd like to take this moment now

225
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,520
to let you all know

226
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,440
i

227
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,000
did not poison louise honey does anyone

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
here know louise honey

229
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,479
no good she's not dead for the record i

230
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,840
didn't poison her

231
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
cover your ears for this and we didn't

232
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,879
poison anyone i promise you

233
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,240
so this is another attribution issue

234
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,440
this is personal

235
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,000
at school i was pulled out of a lesson

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
and nearly expelled for poisoning louise

237
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,840
honey

238
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
has anyone here been expelled from

239
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,840
school for poisoning

240
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,440
anyone still no

241
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,039
i thought we'd have one person come on

242
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,039
what had happened was um there's this

243
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,160
stuff you can get to put in your

244
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
fingernails when you're a kid to stop

245
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
you from biting your nails or sucking a

246
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,039
thumb it's called stop and grow i don't

247
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,479
know if you have it in the netherlands

248
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,240
tastes disgusting

249
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,319
it goes in the in the mouths of children

250
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,559
ergo it is not poison

251
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,080
so let's just be clear on that for a

252
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,958
second my friend amy decided that we

253
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,240
should put some of this on louise

254
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,479
honey's cup for a joke

255
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
so we did except when i was holding the

256
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
bottle and she's posting it around the

257
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,640
cup she got my handlebar and loads of it

258
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
fell in the drink and then she went to

259
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,560
the teacher went sam poison louise honey

260
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,839
so now we've got a situation where the

261
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,800
threat intel is wrong the attribution is

262
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,440
wildly unfair and i did not poison

263
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,959
louise honey and my mum still wouldn't

264
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,480
believe me even though i was going

265
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
through the scientific

266
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,720
parts of why this can't be poison

267
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,399
and that ruined my education

268
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,480
no it didn't but i didn't get expelled

269
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
but it was a little bit hectic so for

270
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,680
the record this never happened

271
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,360
okay so we know i didn't poison anybody

272
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,240
i want you to play a game now with me

273
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,360
i want you to pretend you're a

274
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
government

275
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,160
pick a country any country not new

276
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
zealand everyone likes them probably not

277
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,519
canada we can blame them for everything

278
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,640
okay so you're a government

279
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,680
where does attribution work for you

280
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,519
your government you've got satellites

281
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
you've got an army probably navy maybe

282
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,240
an air force all those good things

283
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
you've got loads of agencies working for

284
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
you

285
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,560
attribution might be useful

286
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,920
some of the agencies like kind of like

287
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,839
attribution something they do a lot of

288
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,120
there's a lot of them working at the

289
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,600
agencies

290
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,279
is anyone here actually a government

291
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
hands up

292
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,600
no see we're not governments attribution

293
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,959
is

294
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,000
i did learn the dutch word for

295
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
attribution by the way i think it's

296
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,519
attribute c

297
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,120
there's the dutch word for cowbell

298
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
 is the same word as it is in

299
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,720
english so that was no help to me i

300
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,880
couldn't disguise my terrible words

301
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,000
that's why we've got a cowbell

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
do you

303
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,279
no i've got nothing

304
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,920
so here's the thing even governments or

305
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
agencies they can take years to

306
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,200
attribute this is a horrible story this

307
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,000
guy

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
um is now a convicted nazi for working

309
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,959
in concentration camps 76 years

310
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,560
it took

311
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,880
for this guy to be sent to prison

312
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,600
and they're a government

313
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,640
it takes a long time

314
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
so this may be a

315
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,040
slightly less terrifying story but still

316
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
a friend of mine when we were chatting

317
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
through this talk said to me the other

318
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
day attribution is not a headline

319
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,839
so now it's a headline

320
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,079
but here we go um anthem they were

321
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,200
famously hacked in 2015.

322
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
it took about four years

323
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,519
for the us government to decide to

324
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,440
indict two chinese

325
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,360
researchers

326
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,640
professional hackers call them what you

327
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,279
like cyber criminals bad guys whatever

328
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
whatever so

329
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,279
bad usage of the word hackers there but

330
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,560
still four years

331
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
to indict them

332
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,880
and still they don't know why

333
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,480
other than the obvious

334
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
money and stuff which is why anybody

335
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,120
hacks anything right money and stuff

336
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,279
but it took a long time

337
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,120
but here we go

338
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,800
i think this is very true of attribution

339
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,519
the best attribution still is disputed

340
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,440
it can be flawed it could be the gauguin

341
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,959
situation

342
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,120
and even when you're sharing it

343
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
why is it you want to blame somebody

344
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
what is it you get back from that i love

345
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,240
the fact that music's really loud over

346
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,440
there as well that's super cool should

347
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,160
we just go over there

348
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,600
we'll get through this how long we go

349
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
it's fine okay 18 more minutes and then

350
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,959
you can go over there and get drunk

351
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,320
we'll stay here and get drunk do you

352
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,360
like

353
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,200
okay let's talk about threat intel

354
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,800
so throughout intelligence can be useful

355
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,079
and i know threat intelligence is not

356
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,680
attribution one can lead to the other

357
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,440
yada yada

358
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,839
but starting with good threat

359
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,120
intelligence that's a good thing there

360
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
can be bad threat intelligence but if

361
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
you're trying to educate people the

362
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,600
government

363
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,760
your bosses your bosses bosses people

364
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,079
who will run at you with a news article

365
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,600
and say oh my god this bad thing's

366
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,560
happened

367
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
what are we doing about it

368
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,959
helping them understand better about

369
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,720
you know your risk of an apc group

370
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
coming in to actually hack you whether

371
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,600
or not a nation state will come for you

372
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,519
how frequently that might happen they're

373
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,880
either going to fall into the camp where

374
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,680
they're

375
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,760
super paranoid and blaming canada slash

376
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
the chinese for everything

377
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
or they're like huh

378
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
we're only a small organization who's

379
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
going to bother with us

380
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
and neither of those are necessarily

381
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,440
right

382
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,880
you need to dig a little bit more deeper

383
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
you need to look at your throat profile

384
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,079
you need to understand a lot more about

385
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,200
your vertical there's a lot of reading

386
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
that goes on but educating them in terms

387
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
that they understand

388
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,040
that's the easy bit right

389
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,760
about what what your risk is

390
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,000
how easily can you be attacked

391
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
and what do you have that's of interest

392
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
to someone who's going to attack you

393
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,560
that's a really good start

394
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,240
top tip

395
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,839
don't decide that you want to do a cti

396
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,880
program when you're in the middle of an

397
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,760
incident i found that works really badly

398
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,600
um so let's not do that but we need the

399
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,959
usual stuff it's like anything we build

400
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,480
in cyber security

401
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,880
running off to the end goal without kind

402
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
of thinking through this stuff

403
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
is not it's not good we need those

404
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,399
things we need to have the business

405
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,639
level requirements we need to have

406
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,880
decent reports feedback loops we need to

407
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
be able to tell stories with threat

408
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
intel not i have got seven of these

409
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
things and eight of those

410
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
communicating out your throat intel

411
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
program

412
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,880
has to be something that works for your

413
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,279
organization not a bunch of beans that

414
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,959
you counted and graph goes up graph goes

415
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,479
down ooh abcs

416
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,360
what do you already know

417
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
hopefully you do know something

418
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,839
what are your risks where are your risks

419
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,120
what happened the last time you got

420
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,560
pwned and the time before that and the

421
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,279
time before that who loves an rca

422
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,079
sam loves rcas i actually do

423
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,360
it's like watching a really slow car

424
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,800
crash again

425
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
and again and everyone blaming each

426
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,639
other good rcas though don't have to be

427
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
like that root cause analysis can be fun

428
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
tm all right trinity good

429
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
trinity's never lived through an rca

430
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
oh the innocent

431
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
what could go wrong what did we learn

432
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
last time

433
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,240
what don't we know

434
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
that's always quite a good place to uh

435
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
to look at as well

436
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,880
if you want to get to attribution if you

437
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
really do want to do it throwing a load

438
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,800
of stuff into a tip is not going to get

439
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,839
you there

440
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,440
a lovely story

441
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
um whilst doing some more scientific

442
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,680
research on the internet

443
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
from someone who decided that they'd

444
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,639
found

445
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,240
the chinese and the north koreans

446
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
working together they just got this

447
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,440
brand new tip put some information into

448
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,720
it and they're like oh my god we found

449
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
look this is amazing

450
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,800
this is collaborations going on here and

451
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
it turns out they'd left some some

452
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,760
contact information in one of the

453
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,120
headers

454
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,519
from a different issue from north korea

455
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,199
put the two things together

456
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,880
sent a report up to their bosses and

457
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,079
said like hey aren't we clever look what

458
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,000
we found about four hours later when

459
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,759
these two things aren't actually related

460
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,040
to each other

461
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,480
there's a lot of human error that we can

462
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,759
do here

463
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,880
tips are good you need to feed them

464
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
you also need to make sure that you know

465
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,120
what you're doing with the data you've

466
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
got and there is good intel and bad

467
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,639
intel out there

468
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
um i met marcus in vegas

469
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,759
and bought him a drink

470
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,399
so this is a true story

471
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,720
he remembers wannacry

472
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,399
he doesn't want to admit to one again

473
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,720
so i wanna cry marcus did his cool stuff

474
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
he read the story domain to see what

475
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,360
would happen

476
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,680
and became kind of a an anti-hero

477
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,240
superhero just through being curious

478
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,519
then got in a load of trouble for other

479
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,800
things

480
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
but registered this

481
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,759
and there was another sinkhole as well

482
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
as part of wannacry

483
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,680
and because bad things from the bad

484
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,839
malware is bad okay

485
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,959
isps started blocking this domain

486
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,120
great plan except this was a sinkhole if

487
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,399
the malware could connect up to this

488
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,440
domain it would not run wannacry

489
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
if your isp has now blocked this savior

490
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,320
you've now got wannacry

491
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,639
so whilst you saved a bunch of people

492
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,240
there were also a bunch of isps that

493
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,000
tried to reverse that because they saw

494
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,079
intel and decided malware url is bad

495
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,959
our url is not always bad often is

496
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,959
sometimes isn't

497
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,638
bad threat intel makes me want to cry

498
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,199
she's still good that music does sound

499
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,800
really good not gonna lie

500
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,399
okay attribution is distraction

501
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,839
disturbance or a total cowbell disaster

502
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,199
so this is back to our blame this is

503
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,559
back to trinity being pushed over and

504
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,720
wanting to know why can we want to blame

505
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,760
things

506
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,839
we want to blame somebody because here's

507
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,760
what happens right we all know this

508
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,119
bad bad thing happens in the

509
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,640
organization

510
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,839
attacker comes in malware

511
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
outbreak can't answer a question

512
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,919
it's a security team's fault

513
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,000
it's always our fault

514
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,679
it's our fault more of the time that

515
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,199
it's not it's not the fact that you know

516
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,440
that nobody's invested in in our program

517
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
we haven't had the budget that we need

518
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,640
we haven't got the tooling that we want

519
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,400
we're struggling to hire people all the

520
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,559
stuff that we would like to learn about

521
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,960
it's our fault when stuff goes wrong

522
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,400
so what do we need we need to be able to

523
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,760
attribute so we can say it with the

524
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,160
chinese that's helpful what could we

525
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
have done

526
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,840
but

527
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,799
flippancy aside

528
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,400
it's more than that if you can get your

529
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
threat intelligence program right and be

530
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,840
able to educate the people above you and

531
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,200
around you and the people that hold the

532
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
first strings

533
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,120
this becomes less of an issue

534
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
we don't necessarily need someone to

535
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,039
blame we're able to tell stories and

536
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,280
explain what we're doing a lot better

537
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,039
than rather than going oh my god it's

538
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,320
happened again who did we blame

539
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,600
the cowbell

540
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,039
chinese right thank you

541
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,120
this is true

542
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,280
i used to work at incident response

543
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,720
if you look at my linkedin now i also

544
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,160
work in marketing now there's a reason

545
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,480
for that you came up this is obvious

546
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
instead of response product marketing

547
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,440
because you're fed up of incident

548
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,280
response

549
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
product product management follow

550
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
marketing you get fed up with doing

551
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,600
engineering plans and then you're doing

552
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,360
marketing and also helping people

553
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,760
understand things that can go wrong

554
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,919
this is my boss steve who also works in

555
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,039
the security strategy team

556
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,280
this unless you are a government and to

557
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,200
be honest at that point

558
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
you should have figured out some of this

559
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,720
who it might be beforehand

560
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,640
you need to know

561
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,720
what's happening when it's happening

562
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,080
where it's happening to be able to do

563
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,440
something about it

564
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
who did it and why they did it can come

565
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,559
afterwards if it matters at all

566
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
okay quick hands up

567
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,760
who's been in the middle of an

568
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
investigation and someone comes running

569
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,640
up to you to tell you what they think

570
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,039
the problem was

571
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,200
yes

572
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,679
i love it it's my favorite thing

573
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,960
when someone comes running over yeah but

574
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
it was china

575
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,679
just go away it's like doesn't you're

576
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,600
not helping me here i'm glad you have an

577
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
opinion thanks for playing please go and

578
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,880
take it somewhere else

579
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,480
out the building

580
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,520
hands up it's happened to you more than

581
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,160
once yeah still stop telling me it's

582
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,960
china i don't care at this moment i'm

583
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
not government

584
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
and here's where things get really

585
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
interesting

586
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,200
cyber insurance companies now are saying

587
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,440
they won't pay out

588
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,120
if they think it was a state a

589
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,640
nation-state attack

590
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,840
because that is an act of war my friends

591
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,080
so chances are you can do your lovely

592
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
attribution you can come out to the

593
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
press and say all right we've got it

594
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,080
it was china for us north korea probably

595
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,440
canada

596
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,120
and now your cyber insurance won't pay

597
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,960
out

598
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
amazing

599
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
so

600
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,919
because of that should we not try to

601
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,440
attribute what if they find that anyway

602
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,039
what if they send somebody in this is

603
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,480
where insurance is horrible and

604
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
insurance people are the worst people on

605
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,559
the planet if anything let's blame

606
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,360
insurance people

607
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,679
all right

608
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,320
but ranting aside all of us only have so

609
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
much time in the day

610
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,559
none of us have 357 million people

611
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
working on security teams what is the

612
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,799
best use of our time

613
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,840
is it

614
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,120
running to the end and trying to

615
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,640
attribute

616
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,720
or is it finding out what the hell is

617
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,159
going on

618
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,679
solving that

619
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,760
figuring out why that happens and

620
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
improving things so that maybe next time

621
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,000
it might be better

622
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,840
for me that works better

623
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,200
if you want to go attribute in your

624
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,600
spare time right totally well do that if

625
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,640
you want right

626
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,280
cool stuff sometimes you can end up down

627
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,440
a rabbit hole where you might you might

628
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,640
be prodded in the wrong places

629
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,720
again does it matter are there better

630
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,159
things you could be doing than

631
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,440
attribution i would say yes and remember

632
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
i still don't have a cake so maybe when

633
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,360
that cake turns up one day i might

634
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,080
change my mind

635
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,159
it's okay so hopefully you've decided

636
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,679
the attribution is amazing and sam's

637
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,559

638

699
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640

701
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,000
i still think that attribution is often

702
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,679
gabo

703
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,960
thank you

704
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,320
electrical government we'd all like to

705
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
be a government you might be europol we

706
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,520
didn't play but let's pretend to be

707
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
europol that's a whole different talk

708
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,600
um and none of us are a cyber insurance

709
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,279
company i hope at least we wouldn't

710
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,400
admit to it

711
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,919
threat intelligence is not buying a tip

712
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,600
chucking stuff in it and expecting it to

713
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,279
work

714
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,679

715
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,559
say this but they can be wrong too

716
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,960
literally nobody poisoned louise honey

717
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,279
nobody

718
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,120
choice is an illusion

719
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,480
the cake

720
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,039

721
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,200
