1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:17,820
[Music]

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,640
and well this shouldn't be a too big

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,800
problem today but if you're sitting too

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,960
close to each other please consider

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,359
wearing a mask we already know had one

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,719
outbreak in a village uh just today

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,960
so it's actually around here so take

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
care and protect yourself

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,399
yeah with that

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,520
i will turn over to my first speaker

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,399
and

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
yeah please a big round of applause to

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
el corto who will talk a little bit

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,199
about

15
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,559
not making neural networks secure

16
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,800
thank you

17
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,879
test test hello all right can you hear

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,640
me well all right cool

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,119
so uh thanks for being here i think this

20
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
session is the only session where there

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,960
are only speakers in the audience more

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,080
or less

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,040
um

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,960
this is my first talk at an event like

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,159
this so i

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,400
thought i'd start with a lightning talk

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,280
um

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,680
the topic of the talk is uh how to make

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,799
new networks better with uncertainty

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,799
and we'll find out in a minute what that

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,799
is all about

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,280
so um if you're not working in machine

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,119
learning and you want to learn about it

34
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,439
you might google for it and you see

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,360
basically images like this

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,799
there are different kinds of machine

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,400
learning supervised ansible wise

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,720
reinforcement

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,479
and then you think okay i'll start with

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
the first one supervised machine

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
learning

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
then you see cartoons one like this and

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,240
you wonder what the heck just fruits and

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,799
heads and everything

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,280
or pictures like this again fruits and

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,159
machines and stuff

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,880
and to make this a little bit more like

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,399
mathematical

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,520
um

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,439
what supervised machine learning is is

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,640
basically

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,038
finding some mapping from

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,280
data x which is the input

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,080
to

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
theta y which is the output

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
and this is all there is to it there's

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,480
we have some data we have some inputs we

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,120
have some outputs and we know that

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,959
there's some relation between them but

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,200
we don't know which it is and this is

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
exactly what supervised machine learning

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
is all about finding this relation in

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,879
some way shape or form

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,200
and we call in this context

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,800
lowercase x an input point

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
which is an element of a set of points

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,080
capital x

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,280
and

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
lowercase y is a label or target or

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,440
output

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,959
and this is what we got and this is what

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,920
we have to work with

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
and what we do is we want to find a

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
mathematical function which maps from

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,720
our x from our inputs to the outputs y

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,360
and our task is to find that function

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
that function takes the input x and has

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,280
parameters theta that we need to find

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,959
so in mathematical terms very

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,840
loose

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,040
very floppy mathematical notation we

82
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
define what's called a loss function

83
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
which is the which depends on the

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,599
parameters of our model f

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,159
and we try to minimize that loss

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,040
function in order to find the parameters

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
that model the relation in our data best

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
so this is what supervised

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
machine learning apart from all the

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,040
fruits and heads this is what it's all

91
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,079
about it's very simple

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,080
and

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
now to introduce the concept of

94
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,640
uncertainty we start with some

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
one-dimensional toy data

96
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,200
so what you see here um

97
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,560
is a function g of x which we usually

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
don't know we want to find it but for

99
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,760
the sake of this argument we pretend

100
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,519
that we know

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,439
but in reality what we are giving is

102
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,959
only the

103
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,720
the input points the the blue points

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,360
with some added noise usually

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,959
think of it as a measurement from a

106
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,280
measurement device or something

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,680
and our task is to find that orange

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,600
function that we don't know

109
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,560
and notice that there are some gaps in

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
the data so we have two gaps where

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,320
we know what the data looks like

112
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,120
but we don't have for example because

113
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,080
our

114
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,160
measurement device broke down while

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
taking that data

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
and what we want

117
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,720
our function or our machine learning

118
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,520
model to do is to tell us that in the

119
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880
regions where we don't have data that

120
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
the prediction of the model should tell

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,120
us that it's very uncertain about this

122
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,479
prediction

123
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,759
and

124
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,479
we can do this without neural networks

125
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,120
in a classical statistical way

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
using what's called a gaussian process

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
regression method

128
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
this is well established textbook stuff

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,800
and what it gives us is the red curve

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,520
you can see it yeah probably pretty much

131
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,240
this is the fitted model to the data

132
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
and you see that

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
in the middle region where we don't have

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,840
data the true function and

135
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,120
the um

136
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,400
and the model

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,639
don't quite match up and in this region

138
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,280
the gray area which is our uncertainty

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
is pretty high and this is what you want

140
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,639
and this is what normally nobody does

141
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,680
now in or not many people do in machine

142
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,400
learning uh to fit a model but also to

143
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
get some information about where the

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,240
model is good and where the model is bad

145
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,560
where basically what you want is a model

146
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
that tells us um i can give you a

147
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
prediction for this particular input

148
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,080
point but i

149
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,039
did not see data at this um at that

150
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,080
region and for that reason

151
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
my uncertainty is high or my confidence

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,479
and my prediction is low

153
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,720
and the good news is we can do the same

154
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,039
thing with neural networks which don't

155
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,360
have that capability built in

156
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,639
and the most

157
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,440
uh

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
simple way to do this is

159
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
instead of training one neural network

160
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
to fit that model to fit that data we

161
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,319
use

162
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,000
50 different neural networks and we

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
exploit the fact that your networks are

164
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,479
super bad at extrapolating in data

165
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,800
regions where they did not see data

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,039
before so you see in the top

167
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,400
plot you see

168
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,360
barely

169
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,319
these gray bushy curves so each of one

170
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,479
each of them is one your network fitted

171
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,880
to the same data

172
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,199
but in between the regions in between

173
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
the data regions the models basically do

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,599
what they want and we exploit this to

175
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,720
get some uncertainty information

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
and the even better news is instead of

177
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,160
using 50 in your networks we can often

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,440
do

179
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360
quite well just with five

180
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
so this means

181
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,919
our computational load only increases by

182
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,840
a factor of five which for some

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,919
workloads might just be good enough

184
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,160
there are other methods i won't bore you

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
with this because of time and math there

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,759
are other methods that scale

187
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,759
computationally much better

188
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,520
approximating

189
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,479
these kinds of things the one

190
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,520
quite well-established and fast method

191
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,319
is called the laplace approximation

192
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,080
yeah math

193
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,800
which basically gives us a picture

194
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,080
pretty similar to the one we saw before

195
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
that in the regions where we did not see

196
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,599
data

197
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,520
we have a higher uncertainty and this is

198
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
what you want so the

199
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,639
message here is we can make your neural

200
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,240
networks give us

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
uncertainty information

202
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,720
um which is not a standard thing to do

203
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,919
yet in machine learning pipelines

204
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,759
and finally

205
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,599
after some boring 1d toy data

206
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,080
let's use some 3d data

207
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,039
so this is 3d data

208
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,080
what it is

209
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,360
doesn't matter consider it a

210
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
temperature field in this room it's very

211
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,759
hot so you have regions where it's hot

212
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,360
regions where it's cold

213
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
um

214
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
and when we use a machine learning model

215
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,479
and we use only 10

216
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,680
of the data

217
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,599
to train it which i did to make the

218
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,080
model deliberately worse

219
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,880
we see that there are some differences

220
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,240
between the ground truth and the

221
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,440
prediction

222
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,679
and now we check if we can

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,000
quantify these differences with

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,800
uncertainty so what we first do is we

225
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,399
subtract

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,279
the

227
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,040
right from the left

228
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,720
and see the difference between the

229
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,440
ground truth and what the model predicts

230
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
and this is what we get

231
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,320
and now we look at our uncertainty where

232
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
we hope that

233
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
in regions where we have a high

234
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
difference between data and model

235
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,080
prediction we also have a high

236
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,160
uncertainty

237
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,360
and

238
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,839
yeah so message is we're still working

239
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,440
on it but so far

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
it looks quite good so this is very

241
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,240
recent uh data from my

242
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
research project where i'm working on

243
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,959
that i obtained um in the train when

244
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,200
coming here so it's not perfect yet but

245
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,519
we see that we have these four kind of

246
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,519
blobs where the difference between the

247
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,600
model and the data is high and we see

248
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
similar four blobs in the

249
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
uncertainty

250
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
so um

251
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,440
yeah and with that i'm

252
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,399
done

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,640
thanks

254
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,839
[Applause]

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,760
yeah thank you very much for a very

256
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,920
interesting uh presentation and probably

257
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,600
one of the most mathematical

258
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
presentations that we are seeing at on

259
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
the camp

260
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
and uh

261
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
well if there are any questions now uh

262
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
that there are microphones in the middle

263
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,399
of the room uh please step forward and

264
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,800
ask and of course i hope the speaker

265
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,680
will be available for direct

266
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,800
questions

267
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,760
afterwards as well

268
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,920
so with

269
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,560
no questions right now i would again

270
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,640
thank you very much for this very

271
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,320
interesting talk

272
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
please give him a round of applause for

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,800
that and

274
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,279
with that we're coming over to the next

275
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,959
presentation

276
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,040
which will take a couple of seconds to

277
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,920
connect etc

278
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,079
and our next speaker is martin hamilton

279
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,399
who is doing a quick and dirty

280
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,839
batch-based co2 monitoring because kovit

281
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,279
is airborne

282
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,279
it will be interesting to see what this

283
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,240
talk is actually about and

284
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,720
well with that i would open it to our

285
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
speaker whenever you're ready

286
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,959
thank you

287
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,179
[Music]

288
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,800
is this way didn't come away

289
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,760
so

290
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,040
30 seconds to switch from one speaker to

291
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,279
another instead of 15 minutes as you

292
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,519
usually have between talks

293
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,800
so that can happen

294
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,399
you might be able to see

295
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,079
a little loading

296
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,279
progress meter here so hopefully boom

297
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,800
we're up

298
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,519
um hi everyone i'm martin and i'm going

299
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,000
to talk to you about monitoring for co2

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,959
and particularly in the context of covid

301
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,600
kovitz not the only thing

302
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
we might be interested in but

303
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,040
uh

304
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
kind of

305
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
been a little bit of a big deal recently

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
i've been interested in air quality

307
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
monitoring for

308
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,000
a few years now so here's some old

309
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,120
tweets

310
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,800
um we've got

311
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,399
on the left this is the clean space tag

312
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,200
this is a little gadget which monitors

313
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
air quality

314
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,200
and intriguingly you don't plug it in

315
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,000
anywhere it's powered by wireless energy

316
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
harvesting

317
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,880
so it

318
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,480
feeds off your wi-fi and your gsm

319
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,639
signals and it uses them to charge a

320
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
little tiny battery

321
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
and it can do this because it's very low

322
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,720
power just takes a few small readings

323
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
infrequently but just enough to kind of

324
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,040
build up a map of what's what's going on

325
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,760
around you but this is old stuff so let

326
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,200
me see that's 2018. so you think about

327
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
this this this is a few years ago

328
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,399
the one in the middle is the clean as

329
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,279
the

330
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,040
plume labs

331
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,320
flow

332
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,079
and the flow is another one of these

333
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,480
kind of personal

334
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,120
not diy these aren't diy these are

335
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,560
actual products you could buy

336
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,360
the plume unfortunately

337
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,160
this device is now only sold corporately

338
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,880
in in batches so you can't buy it

339
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,040
individually if anyone wants to club

340
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,800
together and buy a few

341
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,519
uh hit me up afterwards and we can maybe

342
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,360
do a shared order

343
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
the one on the right

344
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
is one i personally invested in so this

345
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,240
is something called linometer

346
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
and linometer is designed for schools

347
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
primarily but really any kind of

348
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,320
place where lots of people might gather

349
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,959
together for extended periods in close

350
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,639
proximity

351
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,959
we weren't thinking about covid

352
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,120
kobit was

353
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,839
just coming that picture is from january

354
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,360
2020 when uh learn amateur actually

355
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
launched

356
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
so learnometer was just hitting the

357
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,440
shelves same time as covid started

358
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,959
spreading in

359
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,240
uh uh towns and cities so

360
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,440
the thing about linometer is it's

361
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,639
you know it's gonna cost you a little

362
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,519
bit of money it's about 500 euros

363
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
and actually it tests for a whole bunch

364
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,440
of things because we discovered

365
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,279
children's learning is affected by

366
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,720
noise

367
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,000
light

368
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,320
lots of little things air quality is one

369
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
of them but there's these other things

370
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
too and lanometer tests for a range of

371
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,959
different possible problems with your

372
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,440
air quality different pollutants and

373
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,880
things like that

374
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,680
um so okay

375
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,639
people

376
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,560
mostly weren't talking about air quality

377
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,759
until um would you say maybe january

378
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,360
2020

379
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,959
actually

380
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,120
maybe a little bit later than that um

381
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,600
i've got this graphic here

382
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,800
which is actually from july 2020

383
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,519
and this is

384
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,839
one of many explainers that you will

385
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,639
remember from the news media

386
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
oh hey we just kind of figured out this

387
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,480
covid stuff maybe it like spreads

388
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,639
through the air or something

389
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,920
and

390
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,600
many of you here will know

391
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,440
scientists have been saying for some

392
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,399
time

393
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,800
virologists have been saying for some

394
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,759
time

395
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,199
hey

396
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,720
do you know what there's these things

397
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,560
called aerosols

398
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
um well maybe you want to have a little

399
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
think about those

400
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,480
so

401
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,720
it took a while for that message to get

402
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,399
across and

403
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,839
the picture on the right though you

404
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,160
maybe maybe can't see it too well in in

405
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,519
this environment

406
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,240
uh the the t-shirt probably is quite

407
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,199
quite legible and the skeletons

408
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,000
saying i can't wait to die for the

409
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,440
economy and of course that was the

410
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
reality for a lot of people is

411
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,000
there's this killer disease going around

412
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,079
but you've got to get to work

413
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,240
you've got to pay your bills as we heard

414
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,079
from the previous speaker if you don't

415
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,399
do all of these things the wheels that

416
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,759
turn the economy

417
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,759
seize up and

418
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,720
everyone starves which is not so good

419
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,399
um

420
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,880
so okay i talked about some air quality

421
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,319
monitoring uh tools which

422
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,640
have been created as products

423
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
but what i found increasingly

424
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,760
interesting during the covert era is how

425
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,599
people who

426
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,000
realize there's a problem to solve and

427
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,720
our inventive which actually is an awful

428
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,079
lot of people

429
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,799
can put things together

430
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,839
that are quite astounding so the picture

431
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,840
on the left or the composite of four

432
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,880
pictures

433
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,520
is something called the causey rosenthal

434
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
box and this is what happens when you

435
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,480
take a

436
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
a box shaped

437
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
uh fan

438
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,960
and a bunch of hepa filters so you can

439
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,480
make your own

440
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,559
air filtration system

441
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,120
and this will suck in and trap a lot of

442
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,440
the bad stuff that's in the air and

443
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,160
remember this isn't just covered if you

444
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
think about a typical school

445
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
where lots of small children running

446
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,520
around

447
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,440
gobert is not the only thing they're

448
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
spreading

449
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,480
by any means

450
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,280
so

451
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,559
this also true in workplaces of course

452
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,360
uh and we had the beginnings of

453
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
um what i think we probably mostly come

454
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
to call the culture war

455
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
uh particularly around masks so the the

456
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,160
image on the right is one of many again

457
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,640
pieces of scientific advice saying hey

458
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,840
do you know what if you wear a mask

459
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,360
you're a little bit less likely to be

460
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,440
infected with this stuff

461
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,600
if the person you're talking to wears a

462
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,919
mask well you know what that risk goes

463
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,640
down dramatically so

464
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
we shouldn't have to say this right but

465
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
of course there are a lot of people who

466
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,200
for one reason or another would like us

467
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,320
to think

468
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,160
no no no

469
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,640
masks they're for wimps or masks

470
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,919
therefore pinko commies

471
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,039
real people don't wear masks so we've

472
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,039
had all this stuff going on

473
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,400
annoyingly

474
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,640
around what is perhaps the most

475
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,919
useful non-pharmaceutical intervention

476
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,840
against covid and other airborne

477
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,000
diseases which is a bit rubbish when you

478
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
think about it

479
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,039
um so

480
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,120
what am i really here to talk about i i

481
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
tried building a few

482
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,640
cheap and cheerful diy co2 monitors

483
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,360
remember the linometer it's like 500

484
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,559
euros

485
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,919
um

486
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,240
could we make something which does

487
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,919
maybe just a little subset of what

488
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,640
lonometer does and does it for a lot

489
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,840
less

490
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,400
so this is this is taking you through

491
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
what i've done i haven't invented any of

492
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,440
these these are recipes that people

493
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,799
posted online i've got the links to them

494
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,320
you'll see the link at the bottom of the

495
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,840
slide

496
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,320
these slides are online so the throbbing

497
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
qr code you saw at the beginning will

498
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,919
take you to

499
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,679
my website where there's a link to them

500
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,280
you can follow all the links you can

501
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,200
make the recipes yourself

502
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
if you want to

503
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
so this first one

504
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,640
this was good fun this is

505
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,180
this is

506
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,320
[Music]

507
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,679
quite quite a nice little recipe uh

508
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,159
a guy i think it was in canada made this

509
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,600
for his daughter

510
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,840
so she could understand how safe she was

511
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,400
at school so she would take it to school

512
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
a little cardboard box

513
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,120
and very quickly everyone in her class

514
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,159
wanted to know what the numbers on the

515
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,120
box

516
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,240
said

517
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,840
the picture on the right is me taking it

518
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,880
shopping but how i mainly used it i want

519
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,559
to kind of know if it's okay in the

520
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,159
supermarket

521
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,840
so what's the verdict

522
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,158
well

523
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,480
it's a lot cheaper than the linometer

524
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,280
but it's still a little bit expensive

525
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,679
and it's quite big and heavy i call it a

526
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,000
workout for your neck if you wearing

527
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,799
this thing you're gonna know about it

528
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,520
um the sensor that we use for this the

529
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,000
scd-130

530
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,840
from sensoron

531
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
needs a lot of calibration you've you've

532
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
got to keep calibrating every time you

533
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,559
power the thing up to be sure that the

534
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,360
readings are reliable and yeah you get

535
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,600
to do a lot of soldering so when i was

536
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,760
on this journey i i

537
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
developed my soldering technique from

538
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,320
zero so i ended up

539
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,200
doing several hundred uh solder joints

540
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,559
by the end of it

541
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,000
and

542
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
this one probably most likely to be

543
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,880
mistaken for a bomb

544
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,960
i was slightly worried about that you

545
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,280
know being taken to one side by

546
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
the security in the superstore or

547
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,039
whatever you know hey

548
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,200
we need to have a word

549
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,679
uh two more

550
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,280
so the one on your left is uh using the

551
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,520
bbc micro bit

552
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,440
um if you're not familiar with the micro

553
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,400
bit they kind of mass produce them and

554
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,559
hand them out to kids in schools in the

555
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,679
uk

556
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,760
a lot of people have built interesting

557
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,000
things that the micro bit powers it's

558
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,679
just a little microcontroller ultimately

559
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,360
this particular product is an air

560
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,000
quality monitoring board that happened

561
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,799
to have a co2 monitor i didn't really

562
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,559
explain why co2 and the answer is as

563
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,080
co2

564
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,480
falls to the ground and builds up in

565
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,880
poorly ventilated areas so if you've got

566
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,760
a high

567
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,200
co2 reading

568
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
you've got problems it's time to open

569
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,720
some windows

570
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,320
open some doors turn that fan on or just

571
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,000
get out get out of here

572
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,679
so the micro bit

573
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,000
that that was an interesting solution

574
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,960
uh another one is using the

575
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,799
uh diy octopus which is like a baseboard

576
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,000
for

577
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,600
diy iot projects and again that the the

578
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,320
one on your right the octopus is using

579
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,880
that scd-30 sensor

580
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,760
um

581
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,400
how do we get on well the micro bit is

582
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,039
super cheap by comparison

583
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,720
this is still a lot of money for people

584
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,120
50 euros but it's a lot less than 500

585
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,440
it's not really bad shaped and i was

586
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,919
kind of hoping to get something that

587
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,240
people really could carry around

588
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,559
on their neck um

589
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,799
didn't work so well for that also it's

590
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,080
estimated co2 this is not the real co2

591
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,240
uh the sensor looks at a mixture of

592
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,960
gases and says well the co2 is probably

593
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,000
about this much on the whole so

594
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
you know

595
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,280
it's probably this much co2 in this room

596
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,480
the uh octopus with nodemcu as the

597
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,200
microcontroller

598
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,520
that's very nice um a little bit

599
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,799
expensive

600
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,799
lots of soldering ah

601
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
get that soldering technique going

602
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,159
but

603
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,440
ultimately

604
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,080
that that particular kit

605
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,919
gives you traffic lights it just gives

606
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:00,960
you

607
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,520
red amber green traffic lights and i

608
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
came to realize

609
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,520
this does not work so well

610
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
you want more information you want

611
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,360
situational awareness

612
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,720
when did the co2 level start to increase

613
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,960
at what point where was i what was i

614
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,720
doing so

615
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,279
this is why i was super excited and this

616
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,520
is actually just a month ago

617
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,440
to discover um this really fantastic

618
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,799
solution

619
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,520
which is based on a board called the

620
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,559
badger 2040 so if you saw my tweets i

621
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,400
said there would be badges this is the

622
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,520
badger

623
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,679
or that's the badger if that's the name

624
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,720
of the

625
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,039
code repository on github that you can

626
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,320
get this from

627
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,720
what why do we like the voucher well

628
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,400
it's it's very simple

629
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,600
uh raspberry pi microcontroller

630
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
very low power integrated e-ink screen

631
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,120
so this really is and i'm i'm wearing it

632
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,799
now this thing is so light and portable

633
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,320
you can just carry it around with you

634
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,440
everywhere it's got the stemmer qt

635
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,000
uh quick uh connectors so you can plug

636
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,159
all kinds of stuff into it

637
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,720
uh and the badger itself is only like 17

638
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,080
euros so you might not want to plug

639
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,840
an expensive co2 sensor into it this is

640
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,880
the a problem still the co2 sensors even

641
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,360
this newer generation you'll see here

642
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,080
the scd-40

643
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,360
one i'm using and there's now an scd41

644
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,400
they're

645
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,039
a little bit expensive so maybe 50 60

646
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,159
euros

647
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,919
so we'd like this to be something that

648
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,840
really could be mass produced so that

649
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,159
everybody could have one this is still a

650
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,159
little bit expensive but maybe if you

651
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,480
order ten thousand of them we could get

652
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,039
that price down a little bit

653
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,279
it's great like i said it's great size

654
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,799
shape weight

655
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,880
and crucially because it's an e-ink

656
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,600
screen it will run for days and days on

657
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,159
that one battery

658
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,240
there is a floor with it you'll notice

659
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
with the other ones i made them red i

660
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,120
said

661
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,480
don't recommend

662
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,120
this one i'd say is ambo this definitely

663
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
works it does the trick

664
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,919
with the scd-41 you don't have a ton of

665
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,559
calibration to do which is good

666
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,799
but unfortunately you need to unplug the

667
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,120
battery to charge it so there isn't a

668
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,679
handy usb connector or something you

669
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,000
could charge it from so for a regular

670
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,559
person you can make this

671
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,559
this does not require soldering you do

672
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,360
not need electronics experience do not

673
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,760
need a phd you can actually just go and

674
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
make this

675
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,400
however

676
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,240
you've still got that annoying problem

677
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
of having to unplug the battery to

678
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,440
charge it

679
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,600
so you can't have everything but i think

680
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,760
give it a little bit more time and that

681
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,679
will probably be nailed maybe there'll

682
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,799
be a

683
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,039
a second edition

684
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,640
so that's kind of me

685
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,159
wrapping up but

686
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,799
before i stop there is one thing that i

687
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,120
wanted to remind people about so

688
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,240
in the west we we tend to look around

689
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,440
and say okay um things are looking a lot

690
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
better for us now

691
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,799
there are a whole ton of people who have

692
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,760
not had a covered vaccination these

693
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,720
people are as vulnerable as we were

694
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,480
before we had our vaccinations before we

695
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,320
had our boosters

696
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,799
the countries in red on the map are

697
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,159
countries where

698
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,279
20 or less of the population has had a

699
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,960
covert vaccine

700
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,039
these people need things like this

701
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,200
they need the vaccines too we've got to

702
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,440
help them any way we can

703
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,080
and without wanting to sound to

704
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,640
do me about this

705
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
the image on the right is a screen

706
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,399
scrape from

707
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,039
advice from the uk government to uh

708
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,279
health and social care providers which

709
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,559
is about

710
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,399
i'm going to say it now it's about

711
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,960
monkey pox

712
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,200
and yeah it says much the same as the

713
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,840
covet guidance that they were given

714
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,240
a couple of years ago

715
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
okay you want to mask up

716
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,200
and get those ffp3 masks on if you're

717
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,880
dealing with these people there's a

718
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
common misconception that monkey pox is

719
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,000
only spread through sexual contact

720
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,279
actually

721
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
it does spread to aerosols but you have

722
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,760
to be really close to the other person

723
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,080
so this is a real danger it's really

724
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
coming for us right now

725
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,240
we're better prepared than we ever have

726
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
been

727
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,919
we do have a vaccine for monkey pox too

728
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,120
which is good

729
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
but we shouldn't let our guard down we

730
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
should think about the people who this

731
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,240
could help

732
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,840
i'd love to talk to you some more about

733
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,480
if anybody's interested so come and find

734
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
me afterwards

735
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,880
do scan the qr code or jump on my

736
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,159
website martinh.net i've got links to

737
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,159
the slides which take you to the

738
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,039
software that i've been talking about

739
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,840

presentation that we just got to see and

743
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,720

eyes open that there is not only just

745
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,840
one problem named covet but tons of

746
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,520
different things that are using our

747
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,279
results to spread

748
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,880
well um

749
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,679
yeah

750
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,679
if there are any quick questions right

751
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,279
now there are microphones in the middle

752
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,360
there may be time for one question maybe

753
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,240
two and otherwise please directly

754
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,880
contact the speaker

755
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,799
for a short discussion if you're

756
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,320
interested in that subject

757
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,640
um well with that

758
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,799
i'm looking forward to my next speaker

759
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,480
victor

760
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,840
yep

761
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,120
hello and welcome welcome to the stage

762
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,080
and victor is going to give a talk about

763
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,480
the document uh documenting for my

764
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,720
future self well for his future self

765
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
actually

766
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,480
um his memo system since 2015 and i'm

767
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,039
kind of anxious to learn what

768
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,480
that is actually about

769
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,320
so while this is may still take a couple

770
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,520
of seconds

771
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,919
i will remind you again to please

772
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,080
remember to drink enough that actually

773
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,080
is important in here

774
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,720
you're losing lots and lots of water

775
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,080
just by sitting

776
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,600
here and then you're stepping out in the

777
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,399
sun

778
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,120
that

779
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,639
i don't want to see you falling down

780
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,279
then another thing as well the lightning

781
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,919
talks are also here tomorrow and on

782
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,480
tuesday so if you have a talk that you

783
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,919
want to present

784
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,320
maybe a short idea or maybe some

785
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,559
unfinished research

786
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,200
please check the wiki for the for the

787
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,120
email

788

also just send an email to mch lightning

789
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,240
at gmail.com

790
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,399

and on tuesday actually currently i have

792
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,240
no submissions

793
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,720
so i hope that there will be some more

794
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,440
during the day

795
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,600
yeah how are the technical things

796
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,600
looking

797
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,480
yeah

798
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,320
like always they'll figure it out

799
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,559
yeah maybe another side note i already

800
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,360
asked for participant as being enabled

801
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,640
so

802
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,440
please do consider that and also i know

803
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,760
that the security team is looking for

804
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,440
some people uh

805
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,480
being available today in the late hours

806
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,960
so if you if you think that may be

807
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,559
something for you

808
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,720
please go and see the security team

809
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,919
uh

810
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,360
just short note

811
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,080
you

812
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,159
shouldn't uh use the microphone on here

813
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,519
because you got feedback from this

814
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,799
because you're ready to do that

815
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,519
yeah that looks good

816
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
oh

817
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,240
yep okay thank you

818
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,600
so thanks

819
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,399
stuff like this happens all the time

820
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,600
messing up

821
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,840
making mistakes

822
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,960
and

823
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,279
i try to learn from that so probably

824
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,279
this event is going to be another memo

825
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,399
because i've been documenting myself and

826
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,039
for myself and for others since 2015 and

827
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,679
i'm using a memo system for this

828
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,560
and uh it started thanks to pete lamater

829
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,280
who was an engineer at the company

830
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,119
i worked with

831
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,520
i once did something with a motor and

832
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
modeling friction and using an algorithm

833
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,320
for that and i let him feel what i did

834
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
so i gave him the motor and the friction

835
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,000
compensation and he you felt it and he

836
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,599
said ah do you use this in this

837
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,599
algorithm and i said no i i don't it's

838
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,800
interesting yes it's really interesting

839
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,879
i'll send it to you tomorrow and i

840
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,719
thought i would just get some

841
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,560
link to code or whatever

842
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,520
the funny thing is like the evening i

843
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,639
met him i got this email with two word

844
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,800
documents describing another friction

845
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,719
algorithm plus how he implemented plus

846
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,960
some other things i was like whoa so i

847
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,440
replied like this is amazing you know

848
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
that you can share this with me and he

849
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,359
said yeah it's because of my memo system

850
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
and i jokingly said

851
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,359
so you probably also have a memo about

852
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,200
your memo system and he said yes i do

853
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,520
have a memo about my memo system so he

854
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,359
sent me that and i was i was sold

855
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,599
the funny part is everybody who worked

856
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,680
with this guy now has his own memo

857
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,200
system because they think it's so great

858
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,359
as i mentioned he uses word i don't like

859
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,200
word um

860
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,520
so i'm i'm using something else which

861
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,800
i'll explain

862
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,760
um

863
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,680
something else is that there in the

864
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
meantime there are many many programs

865
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,400
that kind of do this for you so

866
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
like evernote has a lot of note-taking

867
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,280
stuff

868
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,079
there's zetter custom for uh in many

869
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,000
implementations

870
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,320
but i still think my way is still the

871
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,240
best way although i think if you start

872
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,720
with anything you'll be you'll be helped

873
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,118
greatly

874
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,200
so

875
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,919
why do i think

876
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,520
what was my purpose when i wanted to

877
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,119
make my memos

878
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,599
i want my memos to be mine

879
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,400
so i really want to defend them i'm a

880
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,640
gnarly dog and

881
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,599
they're my memos i write them for me

882
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,680
maybe also for sharing but

883
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,720
the primary audience is me so i don't

884
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
want to give them to evernote

885
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,200
write all stuff in an online program and

886
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,480
find out

887
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,000
when i have 10 years of invested

888
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,160
knowledge that they decide yeah we're

889
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,920
going to switch them to some kind of

890
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,599
subscription model and if you have more

891
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,520
than 100 pages then

892
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,359
something something so i want it to be

893
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,280
mine so

894
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,119
um

895
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,920
what am i using now i'm using markdown

896
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,720
for note taking so i can insert in my

897
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,440
notes i can insert links images

898
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,560
links to other memos which is really

899
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,000
handy because you start reading

900
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,520
somewhere and somewhere you find

901
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,839
references to stuff you did before and

902
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,040
you actually forgot you did it before

903
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,400
and i have a folder structure which i

904
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,760
will show in a minute so if you want to

905
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,400
copy it you can copy it for you use it

906
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,160
for yourself

907
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,000
and that's meant for organizing stuff

908
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,320
that belongs to those notes so if i

909
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,119
write a memo i can include uh pictures

910
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,880
but sometimes i find something really

911
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,280
interesting on a website which looks

912
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,920
like it was made in the 1990s or

913
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,160
something and i think like maybe this

914
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,720
website could go offline shortly or it's

915
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,200
really interesting i just make a copy of

916
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,400
the website

917
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,200
and

918
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,599
and also put that in the folder to which

919
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,040
the

920
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,960
that belongs to the memo

921
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,760
so i'm sharing this with several pcs

922
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,520
i use

923
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,680
and i think one of the nice things is

924
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,560
that i already switched from using mk mk

925
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,760
docs

926
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,440
to also serve the memos to sublime as my

927
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,240
primary editor to adam to vs code and

928
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,040
now he has called plus obsidian to

929
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,839
use all my uh to view my view and edit

930
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,480
my my memos

931
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,320
and i see that as a strong point because

932
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,280
the memos themselves have not changed

933
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,839
so what does it look

934
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,320
like here's a screenshot of official

935
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,760
studio code

936
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,839
you see all the memos on the

937
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,800
on this side so they're all just a

938
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,680
md file with with a with a number

939
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,920
then here you see all my talking to

940
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,200
myself

941
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,079
and here on the other end you see uh

942
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,359
the

943
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,400
the rendered view so i have a preview of

944
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,119
whether my inclusion of a image actually

945
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,359
worked out

946
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,520
um so other stuff i did uh uh uh

947
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,760
uh is a with obsidian and the nice part

948
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,760
about obsidian is that if you uh make a

949
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,440
you can easily get a network of your

950
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,760
notes so if you create references as i

951
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,920
did here so i created references to

952
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
other memos i made you can see how my

953
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,839
memos

954
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,000
connect to each other so the funny part

955
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,920
is that you kind of feel like hey wait a

956
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,000
minute i'm now working on whether i

957
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,240
should change my organize my family in

958
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
an agile way which could be a completely

959
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,599
undertalk to how that relates to

960
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,760
scrum or getting things done or whatever

961
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,599
sharing thoughts is of course what maybe

962
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,920
uh brought me into this very nice thing

963
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,520
is if you have markdown documents you

964
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,839
can use a a

965
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,160
tool called called pandoc

966
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,960
to

967
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,160
easily create word pdf or latex output

968
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,000
and for those of you who are writing

969
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,920
code the very nice

970
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,160
part is that in markdown you can specify

971
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,760
what languages is

972
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,880
and when you

973
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,560
output the render the file through

974
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,680
pandora the word file has actually the

975
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,320
correct syntax highlighting so i'm

976
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,960
really happy with that

977
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,599
same for later but then those of you who

978
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,160
use latex will probably start crying

979
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,200
because the

980
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,359
the way they do it is apparently very

981
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,240
ugly but it works for me that's the

982
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,200
first way to share it

983
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,560
so how to do this for yourself

984
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,319
create a folder the memo folder

985
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,640
every

986
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,599
creator index markdown file

987
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,240
and then i just create uh

988
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,200
uh files with a year year month month

989
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,359
and an index number

990
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,799
so it looks like this my index

991
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,640
and um

992
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,078
say i want to have one for today

993
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,160
i create um

994
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,520
i put the

995
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,000
images and pdfs or whatever belonging to

996
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,720
that

997
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,640
and if i ever find something and i don't

998
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,520
have time to make a memo for it

999
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,119
i put it in the top and in the top

1000
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,560
folder and whenever i have spare time i

1001
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,000
try to sort it back to create new memos

1002
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
to me this really helps because uh i

1003
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,839
find

1004
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,640
whenever i'm debugging or

1005
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,880
writing something new i write down what

1006
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,440
happened uh when i'm reinstalling

1007
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
something

1008
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,640
i write down like oh i went to this page

1009
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,160
to find this quirky little thing

1010
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,480
recently reinstalled my laptop

1011
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,280
so wrote down where i found the

1012
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,119
the tricky parts for this laptop to get

1013
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,000
the brightness keys actually working

1014
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
so next time i do it i already know

1015
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,720
where to find it

1016
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,280
that's it i wish you all very happy

1017
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,510
note-taking and a very nice conference

1018
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:35,280
[Applause]

1019
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,520
well also again thank you very much for

1020
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,200
the very interesting talk and it

1021
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,599
hopefully gave some of us uh some idea

1022
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,680
how to actually like keep

1023
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,079
sort of a diary in a useful way that you

1024
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,079
can actually use for something later and

1025
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,079
not just put it up somewhere under your

1026
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,599
bed or so

1027
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,920
yeah so thank you very much if there are

1028
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,880
any questions the microphones are in the

1029
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,160
middle just step up if you do have a

1030
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,160
question

1031
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,040
thank you very much do you do any kind

1032
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,119
of keywording

1033
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,839
so you have some idea which belongs to

1034
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,680
i don't know writing web pages or

1035
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,160
whatever it is you do or reading a book

1036
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,520
um so

1037
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,720
do you have any

1038
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,599
any approach to that so

1039
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,400
somehow so sometimes i i just if i don't

1040
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,640
have a keyword to start with i just

1041
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,000
start i think that's also the the

1042
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,800
most important part so somewhere i'm i'm

1043
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,040
doing research on systems engineering i

1044
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,520
like model or i heard stuff about model

1045
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,280
based systems engineering

1046
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,079
i'm making a memo about that and start

1047
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,520
my first stuff

1048
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,640
on the go

1049
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,040
i maybe split my

1050
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
memo it's a bit of work because i have

1051
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,880
to sort all the files again which are in

1052
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,359
the folder but that's the way i do it

1053
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,000
but like i made also make made like a a

1054
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,119
books to read list uh and then if i read

1055
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,839
it there's a new note with like my

1056
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,839
lessons learned from it and because

1057
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,440
because of the links it really gets

1058
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
interesting because you

1059
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,760
like somewhere like you get emergent uh

1060
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,599
patterns

1061
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,400
so just start

1062
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,000
hi uh so i've also used the

1063
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,680
note-taking systems like this for a long

1064
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,440
time i would be in fact like interested

1065
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,040
in organizing some kind of get together

1066
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,599
with other people to talk about patterns

1067
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,400
in their stuff and whatnot uh i have

1068
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,640
used rom research athens research

1069
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,000
trillium note is currently the thing

1070
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,599
that i'm on i've previously had like a

1071
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,720
flat text file markdown files uh have

1072
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,640
you tried what are some like other tools

1073
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,359
that you tried or like has anything else

1074
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,640
worked out better for you than just

1075
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,760
markdown files in visual studio code

1076
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,359
uh no

1077
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,560
for for now so i i i looked at a lot of

1078
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
tools and for me one of the most

1079
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,760
important parts is that it you have to

1080
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,599
be able to use the standard markdown

1081
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,839
because that's going to stay for for for

1082
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:06,800
ages

1083
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,680
uh

1084
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,400
and it's so widespread so i'm now using

1085
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,480
obsidian and obsidian has some really

1086
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
nice extensions to markdown but i'm not

1087
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,480
using them because

1088
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,200
if i start using those i'll be tied to

1089
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,520
markdown or to obsidian

1090
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,160
same goes for uh for other other tools

1091
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,920
that are very specific in how you put

1092
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,800
your files or how you and one of the

1093
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,839
things that this system tackles that no

1094
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,960
other systems i find taco is that i can

1095
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,040
store a lot of pdfs that belong to a

1096
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,200
a memo in

1097
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,119
in my file system

1098
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,280
so if i find a lot of data sheets or

1099
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,839
background information or just pdfs of

1100
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:48,800
like

1101
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,119
web pages i can store them with my memos

1102
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,680
yeah trillium nodes has this but

1103
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,359
it makes sense thanks yeah you're

1104
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,680
welcome

1105
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,760
hello thank you for the presentation

1106
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
it's a very interesting topic

1107
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,000
my question was

1108
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,040
i have

1109
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,560
the requirement

1110
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,119
that i need to access and possibly

1111
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,319
modify the nodes from mobile

1112
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,720
and i did not find a good solution for

1113
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,599
this no i'm i'm struggling with the same

1114
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,040
thing and especially and now i'm

1115
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,440
this is the bad part about my system

1116
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,240
that

1117
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
if you store all these large files you

1118
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
don't want to sync them all to your

1119
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,000
mobile at least i don't want to do that

1120
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,359
because

1121
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,680
sometimes the pdfs get really large or

1122
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,020
whatever

1123
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,040
[Music]

1124
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,839
so one way i looked at it is to

1125
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,880
to use the paid obsidian surface

1126
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,280
it's kind of possible because then they

1127
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,720
do the synchronization to a mobile app

1128
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,480
and they also have a way to do it with

1129
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,880
your own tools but uh it's it's quite a

1130
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,560
hassle to set it up

1131
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,119
i also looked at other systems to

1132
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,370
use a note-taking app on a hosted

1133
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,240
[Music]

1134
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,160
next cloud system

1135
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,599
and then you can log in from the next

1136
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,599
cloud system and edit your notes but it

1137
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,000
just doesn't work

1138
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,920
it's it's

1139
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,079
it's open for uh improvement so

1140
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,400
basically no good solution up to now

1141
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,560
correct thank you

1142
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,440
yeah okay so thank you very much again

1143
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,200
and uh

1144
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
victor will still be around hopefully if

1145
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,880
you've got any more questions or want to

1146
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,480
set up meetings with them feel free to

1147
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,680
do so

1148
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,680
so thank you very much again and

1149
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,160
the next talk is actually going to be a

1150
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,480
little bit of a hardware talk

1151
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,640
so a rampone is talking about a

1152
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,520
do-it-yourself solar bike caravan

1153
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,280
and

1154
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,560
he should be on stage anytime soon thank

1155
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,720
you

1156
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,480
[Music]

1157
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,720
need help

1158
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,800
no i don't

1159
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,240
have no

1160
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,200
hi my name is rapon

1161
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,520
i'm from the c4 at the chaos computer

1162
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,839
club cologne and uh

1163
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,400
yeah during covet i was sitting at home

1164
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,599
and then i refound my love for biking

1165
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,079
and then i saw on youtube people were

1166
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,640
building caravans and

1167
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,520
yeah i started building it and

1168
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,960
the

1169
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,760
also the bike is converted

1170
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,440
and

1171
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,559
so

1172
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,599
yeah it's really hot today um and

1173
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,760
yeah and first talk so

1174
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,559
and the bike is actually a normal bike

1175
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,440
you can buy it used for like a thousand

1176
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,280
and you get like really good hardware

1177
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,160
and the conversion was another thousand

1178
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,040
euros and you have a motor here you take

1179
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,520
out the stuff and

1180
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,640
put in the whole uh motor

1181
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,760
then you crunch it together and it's

1182
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,319
actually done it's the conversion takes

1183
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,319
about two hours so if you want to

1184
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,359
convert your own bike in this style

1185
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,000
maybe you do it a little bit more tidied

1186
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,200
up but

1187
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,440
yeah two hours and you're done and your

1188
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,440
bike is now an e-bike and it runs well

1189
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,599
you have to look i don't know about the

1190
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,079
netherlands in germany it's okay to do

1191
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,599
your own thing because

1192
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,880
the law is actually pretty

1193
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,040
not lush it says

1194
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,920
it only may

1195
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,800
the motor may only run while you pedal

1196
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,599
and

1197
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,559
after 25 kilometers it may not push

1198
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,520
anymore and so it's okay if you put in

1199
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,599
25 kilometers and you have your own

1200
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,800
motor

1201
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,359
and also oh yeah that's my best friend i

1202
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,079
need to put it nearer

1203
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,680
so

1204
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,920
yeah you can actually put it in

1205
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,559
different modes but this one is now

1206
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,520
legal it can actually go up to 40 easily

1207
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,720
and it's a 1.4 kilowatt motor but i only

1208
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,400
use it with around

1209
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,079
300 400 watts so it

1210
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,160
is not so it

1211
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,559
lasts longer instead of like going

1212
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,720
really crazy yeah and

1213
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,280
this the caravan it's actually built out

1214
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,680
of um yeah i'm just going to open it

1215
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,559
because i was not finished so there's a

1216
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,480
lot of duct tape but that type really

1217
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,040
works well

1218
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,920
so

1219
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,359
this is gonna be my window

1220
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,640
you see this is the bed and there's like

1221
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,359
storage room down there

1222
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,160
because i need was no time anymore i

1223
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,800
just put screws inside and made it uh

1224
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,240
like really uh so it's tight and

1225
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,640
i want to like have it open because the

1226
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,800
problem is you cannot really reach the

1227
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,319
downside and you're always going inside

1228
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,839
it's better this is the inside so water

1229
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,920
does not get inside

1230
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,200
so on the second day here

1231
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,800
it actually

1232
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,280
broke and there was a little bit of

1233
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,079
wetness on my bed but yeah that's okay

1234
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,119
it's all dry again

1235
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,839
essentially it's mostly built out of

1236
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,960
those aluminum

1237
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,920
fear yeah you can see

1238
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,680
it's it's easily

1239
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,359
buyable and

1240
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,640
then you

1241
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,559
a lot of houses are called

1242
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,040
neaton

1243
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,520
rivets yeah um these things are all with

1244
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,920
rivets and only the plastic is made

1245
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,559
inside with screws and

1246
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:29,839
yeah um

1247
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,640
also i have a battery um

1248
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,760
and

1249
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,400
it's in the back so it always charges

1250
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,119
the solar will always charge inside

1251
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,079
and

1252
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,760
so it provides extra energy in front and

1253
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,359
yeah

1254
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,000
that is actually

1255
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,200
yeah

1256
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,119
the better thing is somebody has

1257
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,680
questions

1258
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,160
because

1259
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,640
i'm i'm sweating a lot right now and i

1260
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,440
need more water at some point

1261
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,240
uh yeah i will do a little

1262
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,319
self-organized session and if somebody

1263
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,240
wants to like look closer it's tomorrow

1264
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,040
at 3 o'clock near carl's west

1265
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,279
so

1266
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,720
carlos west i think it's

1267
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,439
if you come from backbone and you go

1268
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,960
past the heaven

1269
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,720
then on the left side's kaou's west

1270
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,400
yeah okay thank you very much just two

1271
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,920
words for that cool stuff

1272
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,000
and some water yeah

1273
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,599
yeah i'm not quite sure if

1274
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,040
if you actually managed to get that one

1275
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,960
downstair down the stage so i think i

1276
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,040
just keep it

1277
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,880
yeah all right if there are there any

1278
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,680
questions at uh right at the moment

1279
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,800
um if not and or if you would like to

1280
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,640
inspect uh

1281
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,520
the caravan uh in more details i'm

1282
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
really sure he will be hanging

1283
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,200
right around outside for a while

1284
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,680
okay now switching speech speakers

1285
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,280
becomes a little bit more interesting

1286
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,520
than usual

1287
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,680
okay so

1288
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,160
now we i'm happy to announce martin

1289
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,160
richter who is giving us a very short

1290
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,079
introduction into to chaotic dynamics

1291
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,480
i'm really interested to see how that

1292
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,040
introduction is possible in 10 minutes

1293
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,040
when it takes other people years to even

1294
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,800
understand the basics

1295
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,680
um so i'm very looking looking very much

1296
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,040
forward to this talk and with that i can

1297
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,480
hopefully

1298
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,280
yes

1299
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,240
hand it over to our next speaker

1300
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,480
thank you

1301
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,559
okay thank you very much so my name is

1302
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,800
martin i use it

1303
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,200
i work at the university of nottingham i

1304
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,359
am a physicist but i'm working as an

1305
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,960
applied mathematician

1306
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,599
and one one things i one of the things i

1307
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,400
care about is chaotic dynamics almost to

1308
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,440
a fault

1309
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,599
and that's why i thought maybe to give

1310
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,280
you a short introduction

1311
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,000
so

1312
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,760
i hope by the end of these 10 minutes

1313
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,680
you have a vague idea of what chaos is

1314
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,680
and that it's actually quite all around

1315
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,480
us

1316
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,319
and i want to give you an introduction

1317
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,079
in in terms of a small and simple

1318
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,680
example

1319
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,359
so let's assume

1320
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,400
we have a

1321
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,599
some form of landscape so imagine a hill

1322
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,440
and a valet and another hill in the

1323
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,440
middle and a valley and then this goes

1324
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,480
off to infinity and you just put a beat

1325
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,760
or say a ball of some kind

1326
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,359
here and then you just

1327
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,400
let it go

1328
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,520
and as you might as you might think

1329
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,160
it just starts moving it accelerates it

1330
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,640
decelerates gets slower again and then

1331
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,559
accelerates again

1332
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,040
has some higher velocity here goes all

1333
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,240
the way up here

1334
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,119
decelerates turns around and goes back

1335
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,680
so nothing to see here really and that's

1336
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,680
not at all chaotic by any stretch of the

1337
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,680
imagination but this is the kind of

1338
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,400
system i want to talk to you about it's

1339
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,960
it's an asymmetric double well so if you

1340
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,760
focus a bit on the the depth of these

1341
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,240
troughs this one is a little less

1342
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,640
shallow than this one is

1343
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,680
uh

1344
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,240
unfortunately i will bore you uh with a

1345
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,720
little bit of maths formula on the next

1346
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,240
few slides so

1347
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,760
here we are

1348
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,839
what we just saw interactively was a

1349
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,880
particle and a hilly landscape of sorts

1350
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,319
and

1351
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,880
physicists like to model that by

1352
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,960
so-called potential functions and this

1353
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,400
is the one i use you can see that here

1354
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,480
so it's x to the power of four that's

1355
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,400
basically what makes it go to infinity

1356
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,160
at the very end to the left and to the

1357
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,559
right and then there's a minus x squared

1358
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,119
that's basically what does the the bulge

1359
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,920
in the middle and then this mu because

1360
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,799
we all love greek letters times x is

1361
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,040
what gives it the asymmetry so if mu is

1362
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,079
larger and larger and larger the

1363
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,559
asymmetry would be would be uh much

1364
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,160
larger but

1365
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,960
it's not too too big here

1366
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,920
one

1367
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,079
one property of this system is that its

1368
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,240
energy is conserved so you can write

1369
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,040
down

1370
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,799
um this equation here it's called the

1371
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,559
hamiltonian functions

1372
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,640
and it it's a sum of two contributions

1373
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,400
the so-called kinetic energy

1374
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,599
and the potential energy

1375
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,839
and if you put all the equations in

1376
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,760
you'll see that this number is a

1377
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,040
constant

1378
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,640
so

1379
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,240
what do you do with that i mean you just

1380
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,720
saw this ball rolling down and up again

1381
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,319
and down and up again let's assume you

1382
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,160
want to do this yourself

1383
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,280
now solving such a problem is already

1384
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,799
quite complicated

1385
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,280
so you usually do this numerically

1386
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,920
and the way you do this is for example

1387
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,160
i'm a physicist so we love python so we

1388
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,760
use python for that

1389
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,119
there's a routine called scipy integrate

1390
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,400
quad or odin actually and then you write

1391
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,720
the system in a different different form

1392
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,720
so what you can see here is newton's

1393
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,400
equations you might remember from school

1394
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,400
in a slightly different form

1395
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,240
so if you implement that

1396
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,760
what you will see is that there's a link

1397
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,079
between what the particle is doing and

1398
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:23,680
this potential i would like to draw your

1399
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,559
attention to the right-hand side of the

1400
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,400
slides so at the bottom again here is

1401
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,960
our double well this uh well is slightly

1402
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,400
deeper than this one

1403
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,520
and on the uh on the picture above what

1404
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,599
you can see is a so-called face space so

1405
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,280
instead of plotting what what the

1406
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,079
particle is doing while it moves along

1407
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,040
you register its position and velocity

1408
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,520
or momentum at the same time and you

1409
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,160
plot that in a two-dimensional

1410
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,200
plot

1411
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,119
so each of these lines here is actually

1412
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,359
what one particle is doing i'll give you

1413
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,680
an example if you start

1414
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,200
for example here

1415
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,559
it would just

1416
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,559
close this line here and that would mean

1417
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,480
it would oscillate around the left-hand

1418
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,640
side minimum there's the same thing over

1419
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,280
here so you started here and it would go

1420
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,319
around in this circular motion of sorts

1421
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,799
is what corresponds to the oscillation

1422
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,160
back and forth

1423
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,240
if your

1424
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,119
initial position is further up on the

1425
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,119
left hand side say you're on one of

1426
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,520
those curves and instead of going back

1427
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,240
immediately you go over to the other one

1428
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,480
all the way down over here and then you

1429
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,880
have this almost eight like

1430
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,000
shape

1431
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and this is basically how we prefer to

1432
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,680
look at these things because they allow

1433
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,839
us to see everything at once

1434
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:40,880
so

1435
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,760
just

1436
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,319
watching this ball going back and forth

1437
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,240
is nice to to look at but it's actually

1438
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,400
very hard to understand things so

1439
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,960
therefore we prefer this face-based

1440
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,079
picture

1441
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,960
but again there's still no chaos in fact

1442
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,280
if you look at that it couldn't look any

1443
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,119
more regular

1444
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,880
so how do we get chaos into the game

1445
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,040
we get chaos into the game by adding

1446
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,359
by adding a so-called external driving

1447
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,280
so instead of having this double well we

1448
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,799
will have this double well and we will

1449
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,720
now start to rock it gently from the

1450
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,880
left to the right

1451
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,119
so you might think okay that's all made

1452
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,040
up nonsense but in fact if you do

1453
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,000
experiments with say lasers or atoms in

1454
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,280
laser fields

1455
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,520
that is some of the the approaches you

1456
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,280
can use to model that

1457
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,359
so i'll show you again what happens we

1458
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,680
have again our ball here and now this

1459
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,240
time the potential will move up and down

1460
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,400
on the left hand on the right and we

1461
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,319
will be watching what this particle is

1462
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,440
doing

1463
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,880
i'll also

1464
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,440
plot in a faint color

1465
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,520
where this potential was originally

1466
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,839
because the rocking motion is is

1467
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,520
periodic so at the end we will come to

1468
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,520
that state again so here we go

1469
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,520
so you see this potential goes down here

1470
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,880
and then it goes

1471
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,720
higher up again it comes down here so

1472
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,240
this is one was one period of the

1473
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,240
driving and it does a few of them and

1474
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,520
you can see that now of course the

1475
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,880
motion of the particle is way more

1476
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,799
complicated because it now is an

1477
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,559
interplay between what the particle is

1478
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,000
doing and what the potential is doing

1479
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,359
again we have the problem that we can't

1480
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,200
really learn much from that it's maybe

1481
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,799
nice to look at or it would be nice to

1482
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,799
look at if i wouldn't be that bad at

1483
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:23,040
programming but we can't really learn

1484
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,559
much from it

1485
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,640
okay so we'll just leave it at that

1486
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,040
and think is there any anything we can

1487
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,400
do and

1488
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,599
plot it in a

1489
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,119
in a form like that

1490
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,839
so we just follow the particle again

1491
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,000
and instead of watching where it goes we

1492
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,880
just

1493
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,680
put the the x and the velocity component

1494
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,200
into the same coordinate system and

1495
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,599
we'll just have a look at how they look

1496
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:46,880
how that looks like

1497
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,240
so

1498
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,680
that is here

1499
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,440
that's an interactive plot

1500
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,280
again in the background are these lines

1501
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,000
we

1502
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,480
saw for the case of no driving so when

1503
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,160
the potential is static these would be

1504
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,839
our solutions

1505
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,160
right remember the static case was your

1506
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,160
particle started here and it just went

1507
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,240
around like this or it went around like

1508
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,760
this like this eight

1509
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,119
or it was over here when it was on the

1510
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:11,920
left hand side now how do

1511
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,720
these

1512
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,559
how do these

1513
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,240
orbits look like or these trajectories

1514
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,920
look like when there is driving so let

1515
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,400
me just start one so if you can see the

1516
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,920
mouse pointer

1517
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,839
it's currently over here i'm going to

1518
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,359
click i'm going to start a trajectory

1519
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:26,240
there

1520
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,400
and just integrate what happens in the

1521
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,720
background and give you all the results

1522
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,520
here

1523
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,440
and that's what you get

1524
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,119
so because of the driving it doesn't

1525
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,599
really lie onto these one-dimensional

1526
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,680
curves anymore and it gets worse

1527
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,119
it does look similar on the other side

1528
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,839
but if we say go here

1529
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,319
there's actually not much resemblance

1530
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,559
anymore so for the time being we might

1531
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:53,359
just

1532
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,039
take these lines in the background away

1533
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,799
because they are not of any help

1534
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,880
and i just want to show you what happens

1535
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,920
by by starting a few more trajectories

1536
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,079
so all the old trajectories eventually

1537
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:05,359
they are just

1538
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,599
colored gray and only the newest

1539
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,400
trajectories is in color

1540
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,240
but as you can see this plot is not as

1541
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,319
helpful as you might think anymore it's

1542
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,000
it's a bit like a drawing of a

1543
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,760
three-year-old really

1544
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,799
so

1545
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,280
there was a famous mathematician called

1546
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,079
ori ponkari and he came up with a thing

1547
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,160
called the poincare section

1548
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,400
so this is one of those cases where less

1549
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,839
is actually more

1550
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,000
so what i'm going to do now

1551
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,760
is i'm going to show you exactly the

1552
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,000
same data as you can see here but a very

1553
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,079
specific subset of it

1554
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,599
so i'm not going to show you all the

1555
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:40,720
orbit

1556
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,319
x and momentum y x and velocity changing

1557
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,680
over time i only give you the points

1558
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,319
at integer multiples of the external

1559
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:51,839
driving so remember the potential does

1560
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,760
something like this

1561
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,839
and every time it's here

1562
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,359
i'm going to give you these these two

1563
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:58,319
values

1564
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,920
and does this again

1565
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,599
snap i'll give you these two values

1566
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,359
snap and i'll give you these two values

1567
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,599
so it's a very tiny subset of all these

1568
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,599
drawings you can see here

1569
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,280
before i do that let me start a few more

1570
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,960
just to convince you that

1571
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,440
that looking at all the data is actually

1572
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,920
a big mess okay and now i'm going to

1573
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,960
remove

1574
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,520
most of them and just leave these two

1575
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,039
these two these points i was talking

1576
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,599
about and then it looks like that

1577
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:28,880
and it's a bit like

1578
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,960
being out in a hut in the woods in the

1579
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,480
night and you go out and you look at the

1580
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,400
stars and ah suddenly everything is

1581
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,599
clear

1582
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,799
so by removing plenty or the majority of

1583
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,559
these points we actually saw

1584
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,319
that that we can see and understand way

1585
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,960
more so there are few initial conditions

1586
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,960
like these here which would fill

1587
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,960
two-dimensional regions

1588
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,039
densely that's what mathematicians call

1589
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,839
them

1590
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,280
and then there are others

1591
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,319
which

1592
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,480
form these one-dimensional curves and it

1593
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,799
turns out that they are what we call

1594
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,960
integrable and they are what we call

1595
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,720
chaotic so if you have two points close

1596
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,839
by and you start them they uh they

1597
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:10,000
essentially diverge exponentially fast

1598
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,680
but now you can actually

1599
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,599
see way more things than you could

1600
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,359
before because everything is so much

1601
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,400
clearer

1602
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,640
so for example we could now start uh

1603
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,760
trajectory up here and we see this blue

1604
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,559
thing

1605
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,319
it pops up all over the place but you

1606
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,160
can actually see way clearer what's

1607
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,119
going on

1608
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,880
um if we put

1609
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,960
the whole trajectory back in i i bet you

1610
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,880
would not have been able to to spot this

1611
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,240
uh in all the

1612
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,119
all the

1613
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,760
cares which happens there

1614
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,599
okay so that was what i wanted to show

1615
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,680
you

1616
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,359
that if you start

1617
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,839
with a simple potential start rocking it

1618
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,160
that you can introduce chaotic dynamics

1619
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,920
but that sometimes

1620
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,200
less is more

1621
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,359
namely by removing most of these points

1622
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,280
you actually arrive at much clearer

1623
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,119
pictures and that is actually something

1624
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,559
you can then use

1625
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,880
to describe for example molecular

1626
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,480
dynamics and external laser fields and

1627
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,720
that's what i'll do for living okay

1628
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,210
thank you very much

1629
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:13,579
[Applause]

1630
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,079
hello mike yeah thank you very much for

1631
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,960
well showing us to create chaos and then

1632
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,359
if you have chaos how to uh still be

1633
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:26,720
able to see stuff inside that chaos that

1634
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,799
was very interesting to note thank you

1635
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,000
for that

1636
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,280
and yeah we do have one more talk coming

1637
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,480
so please don't run uh off immediately

1638
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,440
and now if you've got any questions

1639
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,839
on this talk the there are microphones

1640
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:42,960
in the middle

1641
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,119
please step forward and just ask your

1642
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,799
questions

1643
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,760
and if there are any immediate questions

1644
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,799
or more complicated ones um i hope he

1645
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,799
will still be around

1646
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:58,000
a bit uh for us more detailed talks okay

1647
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,520
yeah

1648
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,839
why

1649
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,240
why doing things like that you mean yeah

1650
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,480
what's the use of it so the the main

1651
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,160
problem you have or you're facing as a

1652
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,720
physicist that your task is to describe

1653
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,680
nature

1654
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,839
and you you can't it's impossible to do

1655
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,079
this with all the details included so

1656
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,000
somehow you need to find models and

1657
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,319
depending on what kind of of physical

1658
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,400
aspects you want to model you will use

1659
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,839
different languages from your

1660
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:26,720
mathematical toolbox and this is a very

1661
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,359
prominent one now chaotic dynamics are

1662
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,280
very very complicated so in order to

1663
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,680
understand how they how they work in

1664
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,039
principle

1665
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,280
it's much better to use simpler models

1666
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,000
first and examine what kind of generic

1667
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,039
behavior

1668
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,880
can show up in them and that's one of

1669
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,440
the simplest cases to look at hence that

1670
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,400
is one thing

1671
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,480
you can use to to get

1672
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,000
to

1673
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,720
to understand it

1674
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,760
hey thanks for the talk much appreciated

1675
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,000
you are way more educated than i am but

1676
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,640
i actually tried looking at the so you

1677
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,920
were talking about the constant that you

1678
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,520
have in the velocity right

1679
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,520
and when you start shaking it velocity

1680
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,039
is actually while obviously changing as

1681
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,160
well right

1682
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,920
would you agree with me that what we're

1683
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,480
looking at is basically going from a

1684
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,319
linear regression model to a non-linear

1685
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,960
regression model here

1686
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,280
no that would be the wrong mathematical

1687
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,160
tool

1688
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,480
to to describe that so the field we are

1689
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,400
looking at here is called

1690
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,799
dynamical systems more specifically

1691
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,119
ordinary differential equations while uh

1692
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,640
these regression models that's more

1693
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,720
statistics and things like that so

1694
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,200
here's no uncertainty this is it is

1695
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,960
chaos but it's completely

1696
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,599
deterministic if i if i choose this

1697
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,440
initial condition here

1698
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,039
it's completely clear what the next

1699
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,960
points will be

1700
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,680
it's just that if i'm an epsilon off so

1701
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,920
10 to the minus 15 or whatever

1702
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,599
then after a few iterations you'll see

1703
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,760
something completely different but

1704
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,680
it has nothing to do with

1705
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,319
with any of that

1706
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,119
yeah okay thank you very much again and

1707
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,839
a big round of applause for teaching us

1708
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,359
chaos in just a few minutes

1709
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,440
okay and then we are coming to our last

1710
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,720
speaker for today um petroleus who is uh

1711
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,760
going to

1712
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,880
uh give us uh a short presentation about

1713
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,759
uh

1714
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,839
his research project which is uh if i

1715
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:25,839
understood correctly about the drones

1716
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:31,000
and using them in sar operations

1717
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,600
yep

1718
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,600
then

1719
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,799
okay

1720
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,040
okay

1721
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,920
okay hello uh yeah my name is

1722
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,080
petrocelius and i'm going to show you

1723
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,759
some

1724
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,880
short intro on the project we as a group

1725
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,679
called searchwing are working on

1726
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,319
as you can see here it's about the drone

1727
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,198
and

1728
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,439
yeah we use it for mario team search and

1729
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:32,839
rescue missions

1730
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:36,479
for um and we help ngos like sea watch

1731
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:37,279
and

1732
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,600
all the others who work in this field to

1733
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,319
um yeah find people in distress and

1734
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,399
rescue them

1735
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,600
so

1736
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,640
just give you an uh brief overview what

1737
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,319
it is about so

1738
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,719
we build these drones mainly for search

1739
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,080
and rescue in the mediterranean sea area

1740
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,800
so as you might know there are still

1741
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,040
people fleeing for various reasons from

1742
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,000
global south mostly to the global north

1743
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,199
and often they do this by c and i put

1744
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,320
here

1745
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,520
a slide or a screenshot of the

1746
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,360
recent data from the

1747
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,960
unhcr where you can see how many people

1748
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,960
flee

1749
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,280
2020 it was 52 000 and 800 people died

1750
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,840
while doing this journey from

1751
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,600
the south to the north and

1752
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,679
this is still not nice that this is

1753
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,640
happening it's basically unacceptable so

1754
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,640
we try to help the ngos to um yeah

1755
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,840
help find the people before they

1756
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,840
drown so and the ngos who work in this

1757
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,040
field i put just a few of them here it's

1758
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,679
a sea watch for example or ci

1759
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:52,640
um

1760
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,199
rescue ship is another one so there's a

1761
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,120
bunch of them and

1762
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,360
yeah from now and then there are new

1763
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,360
ones also emerging and they go to the

1764
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,280
sea uh they search for people in

1765
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,640
distress and uh yeah mostly in the

1766
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,679
mediterranean but also in the atlantic

1767
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,480
and if they find some they rescue them

1768
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,480
and uh bring then hopefully to a part of

1769
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,760
safety

1770
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,280
and where they can um yeah go on land

1771
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,000
um but it's not only the ngos who try to

1772
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,920
find the people it's also governmental

1773
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,320
actors like frontex

1774
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,239
and they also use drones you can see

1775
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,480
them up here they are way bigger than

1776
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,920
the ones we have

1777
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,719
and they fly around and you can see it

1778
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:39,280
here in this kind of patterns

1779
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,880
over the sea and search for the people

1780
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,600
and if they find them they tell these to

1781
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,440
the libyan coast guard

1782
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,600
and then they

1783
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,280
catch these people up and bring them

1784
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,600
back to libya which is

1785
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,760
not legal by international law but they

1786
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,679
do it anyway and

1787
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,520
yeah when they catch them they don't

1788
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,840
treat them very nice of human you can

1789
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,960
see here that they uh yeah basically uh

1790
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,040
beat them with ropes and stuff so it's

1791
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,000
not very nice what they do but yeah we

1792
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,199
as

1793
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,040
this group of

1794
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,679
drone enthusiasts and programmers and

1795
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,679
mechanical engineers we try to build

1796
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,840
these drones and uh

1797
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,320
um yeah i can show you how this works

1798
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,280
actually

1799
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,440
this is a screenshot from a movie i want

1800
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,960
to show you now

1801
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,719
this gives a nice intro on how the

1802
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,360
system works

1803
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,759
okay

1804
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,800
so

1805
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,800
we um

1806
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:41,199
start from uh the ships

1807
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,080
and

1808
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,239
yeah we we're not only starting from the

1809
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,239
big ones i showed you in in in the

1810
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,080
slides we also start from small sailing

1811
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,320
boats like you can see here and this is

1812
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,159
a video material where we were on a

1813
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,280
mission in the mediterranean and on the

1814
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,360
sailing boat and yeah

1815
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,840
here's just some yeah

1816
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,640
how it works so you we have a tablet we

1817
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,679
program in the tablet the trajectory the

1818
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,520
plane has to to fly um it's quite small

1819
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,520
the drone it's quite cheap actually as

1820
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,400
we use

1821
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,120
hobby rc parts which are

1822
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,080
mostly available from off the shelf um

1823
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,199
and

1824
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,600
yeah it's it's uh we have to the thing

1825
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,239
is we we land at the end in the water so

1826
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:25,840
we need to make this whole thing

1827
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,719
waterproof which makes it a bit uh it's

1828
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,000
a bit un software related uh

1829
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,320
problems we had to solve and it was very

1830
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,960
hard for us it took us basically

1831
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,520
four years now to find a

1832
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,000
working systems to to do this um it

1833
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,120
flies quite far 100 kilometers it's it's

1834
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,199
not that much if you consider the whole

1835
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:48,960
mediterranean but it's something at

1836
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,960
least which can help the the ships to

1837
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,400
find the people um we fly at 550 meters

1838
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,640
altitude and we have like roughly 20

1839
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,320
centimeters per pixel resolution which

1840
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,320
is enough to find these uh

1841
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,440
yeah two by ten meter boats

1842
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,760
and we also fly this rescue or this this

1843
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,600
square pattern you just saw and um yeah

1844
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,400
then we take pictures um after we took

1845
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,120
the pictures we land then we get the

1846
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,080
drone on board the ship again and

1847
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,199
there

1848
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:21,920
we analyze the images

1849
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,000
and i think this will also come in a

1850
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,320
second and you can

1851
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,910
see this in a picture

1852
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:29,840
[Music]

1853
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,080
yeah

1854
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,960
let me make fast forward yeah as i told

1855
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,199
you it's waterproof and yeah we

1856
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,560
retrieved the

1857
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,640
drone with a small uh

1858
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,840
yeah

1859
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,520
and then we get it on board and we do

1860
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,120
the analysis which

1861
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,760
is assisted by a computer vision

1862
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,000
algorithm which uh tries to find the

1863
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,840
boats and then starts the images

1864
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,920
so the human still needs to check every

1865
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,239
image but we just sort them because we

1866
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,800
cannot trust those algorithms and

1867
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,040
therefore we always tell the people

1868
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,080
you have still have to watch every image

1869
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,239
okay

1870
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,520
so

1871
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,840
i hope this gave you a small idea how

1872
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,520
the system works in general

1873
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,040
okay

1874
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,920
so i told you we were working hard on

1875
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,159
the the hardware issues we were facing

1876
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:25,600
with the waterproofness and in the end

1877
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,080
we we settled down with a

1878
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,120
3d print but instead of doing it on our

1879
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,719
own which

1880
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,640
wasn't working very well

1881
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,640
there were always holes in the 3d print

1882
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,440
even if you took so much effort to to to

1883
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,880
make it waterproof it's not really

1884
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,440
waterproof if you put it under water for

1885
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,840
some time it's still water coming in so

1886
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
we settled down with an uh laser

1887
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,920
sintering

1888
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,880
box which is was then finally waterproof

1889
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,040
and we put there in all the components

1890
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,440
like gps raspberry pi you can see it on

1891
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,840
the bottom right the green one there the

1892
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,159
two cameras are connected which are on

1893
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,040
the bottom middle side mid mid

1894
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,760
area and we have a telemetry onboard

1895
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,360
it's the antenna which is coming out of

1896
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,159
the the box and we also have a

1897
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,640
wi-fi connection maybe soon but that's

1898
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,040
still in

1899
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,440
development we have the in the on the

1900
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,400
right hand side

1901
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,560
you can see a small board which is the

1902
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,719
autopilot so the drone is flying fully

1903
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,159
automatically

1904
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,560
running uh autopilot auto

1905
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,960
autopilot autopilot

1906
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,280
um yeah i told you we have this boat

1907
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,080
detection algorithm and to give you an

1908
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,400
idea how hard it is as a human to find

1909
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,719
autobots maybe you can now try to

1910
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,480
actually find all the boats in this

1911
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,719
image because it's not so easy i mean

1912
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:47,280
one is quite obvious but do you find any

1913
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,840
other boats

1914
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,080
or how many boats are in it actually

1915
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,719
any bets

1916
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,400
i hear 10 4

1917
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,760
14. all wrong

1918
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,120
it's only two

1919
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,159
but it's

1920
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:08,320
as you can see it's very very hard to

1921
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,640
distinguish all these small boats from

1922
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,640
uh like uh waves and stuff it's it's not

1923
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,960
really easy talks a task especially if

1924
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,600
you're on board a rescue ship for two

1925
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,679
weeks and uh there are high waves uh

1926
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:24,800
all day

1927
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,000
then you're super stressed and you

1928
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,320
cannot really focus on on finding all

1929
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,679
the boats in these roughly 3600 images

1930
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,760
per flight so this is

1931
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,679
so we need some computer to help us on

1932
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,360
this task

1933
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,840
yeah i'm also coming to an end now

1934
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,040
this was just a small intro and

1935
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,600
we might do another self-organized

1936
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,520
session today where i get

1937
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,600
where i can say more details and stuff

1938
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,440
which went wrong and which works quite

1939
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,560
well um we are always trying to find

1940
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,400
more people to to help us

1941
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,760
um on our stuff it's mostly open source

1942
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,080
or yeah it's almost everything is open

1943
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,360
source what we do

1944
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,320
um

1945
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,000
we search people for software for

1946
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,840
hardware and

1947
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,840
yeah on the right hand side i put some

1948
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,640
tasks we recently

1949
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,719
currently have regarding the image

1950
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,640
recognition task or if you find anything

1951
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,080
which

1952
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,840
appeals to you or you want to learn

1953
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,800
maybe also then yeah just hit me up and

1954
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,560
would be very happy to

1955
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,719
talk to you about this stuff

1956
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,920
so um yeah thank you

1957
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,239
maybe one more info regarding the

1958
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,000
self-organized session so it will be

1959
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,560
maybe because my laptop has just died so

1960
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,880
i need to check if i still can do it but

1961
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,199
it should be at seven in the thousand

1962
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,440
one nights

1963
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,120
village just

1964
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,560
to the left to you

1965
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,080
yeah thank you very much for a very

1966
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,560
interesting overview and if

1967
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,040
uh if there's um

1968
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,080
uh well it's about saving people's lives

1969
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,000
so if there's anything that is worth

1970
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,280
your support that's probably their work

1971
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,640
yep um

1972
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,520
for any questions microphones as usual

1973
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,280
are in the middle

1974
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,360
so if you've got questions just about

1975
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,679
please

1976
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,560
hi i was uh thank you for your talk i

1977
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,400
was wondering who's who's funding all

1978
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,520
this

1979
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,520
um currently uh or until

1980
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,320
two months ago it was basically our own

1981
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,640
money from the pockets and now we get

1982
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,480
some funding from

1983
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,800
stephen c notreton so they fund us with

1984
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,679
some money to pay
