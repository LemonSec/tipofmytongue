55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
okay

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,480
yeah thanks so how we got introduced as

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,440
parents to digit

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,959
digitization in schools was basically

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,000
when uh covet started and our kids came

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,599
home with two google accounts uh for for

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,519
each of them naming their pers made in

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,000
their personal names and and basically

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,879
yeah

64
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,280
you know administrating

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,680
you know things uh about them at school

66
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
which was new to us

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,160
um so then uh we um you know asked the

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,519
school you know

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,280
why is this now being done because

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
before that the school had not been

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
digitized that much and basically the

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,159
response we got from the school was well

73
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
the kids need to work with this because

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,959
they need a job after a while

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,599
they are basically safer using google

76
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,239
than using a standalone computer with a

77
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,360
usb

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,319
stick

79
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,200
uh and it is all uh you know privacy

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
compliant and we have a contract with

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
google to keep us safe

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,879
and basically the last comment made me

83
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
think back of my first contract with

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
google when i became a proud user of

85
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
gmail and they said they would never

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
look at my emails to provide me with

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,640
marketing materials and and by now

88
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
they're scavenging every corner of my

89
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,599
inbox to to show me advertisements of

90
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,720
course

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,959
so um the school was actually very

92
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,200
helpful because they said we will delete

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
your kids accounts and we'll make

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,120
aliases for them so they're now named

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,959
after um

96
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,680
you know cartoon figures at school

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,560
uh but still it it is a bit worrisome to

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
us that that this is just being used

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,439
with without a a a clear reason at least

100
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,560
uh to uh to us um

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
and soon we noticed that that more and

102
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,920
more accounts were um were being

103
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,120
made um so at the moment there's about

104
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,519
eight uh sort of digital tools the

105
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
school uses for varying things like

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,480
doing

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,160
school exercises like

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
you know having video metrics about how

109
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
they move around during

110
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,720
gym gym lessons exercise lessons and

111
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
of course you know using google as a as

112
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,600
a general tool also for video meetings

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
uh there's also a fully digitized school

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,479
report uh which you know shows

115
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,800
everything and and and presents

116
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,440
everything around the kids which can be

117
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,919
accessed by not only us but but but

118
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,840
others as well and there's a lot of

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,759
whatsapp use at uh at school at the

120
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,800
moment

121
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,759
um

122
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,479
and and you know a bit of a worry to us

123
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,560
as well is that there's a it seems to be

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,199
a

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,440
collective unawareness of the risks of

126
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,080
uh of using uh all these tools they're

127
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
of course very handy and very practical

128
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,880
but at the same time you really see that

129
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,479
you know school doesn't

130
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,199
really you know lecture the kids on it

131
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,440
by saying for instance you know when

132
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,919
they go through uh what to do when when

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,759
to log into an app they say yes and

134
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,080
accept all cookies and when there was

135
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
one app that

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,880
needed a password they had the list of

137
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,759
all the you know kids in the class and

138
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,440
they made some

139
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
some usernames for them and password and

140
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
they sent the list

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
of the 31 people

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
31 kids in the class to all 31 kids with

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,560
all the passwords and this was a tool

144
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
that was that was also linked to

145
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
you know the general education system in

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
the netherlands so it was uh you know it

147
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
just shows that school is also and very

148
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,919
understandably not really on on top of

149
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,120
things

150
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,479
um

151
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,120
so what did we do well every school in

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
the netherlands has a privacy official

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
and and basically that's a person who

154
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,520
doesn't work for a school but but is a

155
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,919
is a hired lawyer basically who

156
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,520
represents the school when there's

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,800
questions about privacy so we we asked

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,280
him but basically he didn't know

159
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,639
anything about the school because he

160
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,199
probably had 50 schools to to help on

161
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,720
these kind of matters

162
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,759
and

163
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,880
the next step we took was to ask

164
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
or send you know requests to to the

165
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
providers of the of the services digital

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,479
services to the school about what data

167
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,800
was stored of our kids and for what

168
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,199
purpose

169
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
the response was that some of these you

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,639
know parties they they they gave us a

171
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,479
call and they said well we're actually

172
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,400
storing lots of data and are you from

173
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
the media and what should we do because

174
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,720
uh they were a bit panicky but they said

175
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
we will delete all this excess

176
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
information they had years of data

177
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,199
stored well they can only store it for

178
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,039
for months for instance but they were

179
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,960
actually very helpful then there were

180
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,520
other parties who responded by saying

181
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,960
well you have to go to your school

182
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
because we're only the the data

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,360
processor of this data and then there

184
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,160
was google who just never gave a reply

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,800
at all so we were we were in sort of a

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,120
situation where school was doing this

187
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
and some other parties were pointing at

188
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,360
the school some parties who did actually

189
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
respond said they were sort of breaching

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,840
breaching it but try to amend it and

191
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,680
then the biggest one google

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,720
was a bit of a question mark

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
yeah thanks so

194
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,960
you know basically because of that we we

195
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
were actually quite uh quite concerned

196
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,400
because

197
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,919
you know first of all

198
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,520
you know the school

199
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,599
should be a very safe place for kids

200
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,080
also for the data but it's also a very

201
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,680
good place for

202
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,919
parties to potentially gather data you

203
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,840
know if if these kids are filling in

204
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
everything if they have to fill in what

205
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,680
they're afraid of if they had to do

206
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,000
exercises on it there's a lot of data

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,479
being collected from these kids and you

208
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,520
just want to protect them against uh

209
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
parties that are just collecting all the

210
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,319
data to to create profiles because with

211
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
these profiles you never know

212
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
what they'll actually be doing with it

213
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,039
um and they you know the only thing

214
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
google i think promises is they won't

215
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
use it for marketing but there's

216
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,400
there's of course they can change it

217
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,479
one-sided and then at the same time you

218
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,759
know there's lots of other things they

219
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,680
might use it for

220
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
and we would like our kids to have to

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
write a resume the next time they want a

222
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,960
job instead of uh you know employers

223
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,560
just googling them

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
um and there might also a bit of a be a

225
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
bit of a risk of a self-fulfilling

226
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
prophecy you know if you if you have a

227
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,399
profile that is really you know this kid

228
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,640
is good at that then you might actually

229
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,760
be steered by it or whatever to to get

230
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
more involved with that and yeah yeah

231
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
and you also don't want that then

232
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
there's of course vendor locking because

233
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,000
when a school is using a certain tool

234
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,720
for a long time you know that's cool

235
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,800
like me i still have my gmail account i

236
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
uh i'm uh

237
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
so the school will probably use that

238
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,160
service for for a long time and actually

239
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,360
you know they can one one-sidedly

240
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,080
change the terms of use which is which

241
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
is something they could use to actually

242
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
work these profiles a bit more and

243
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,640
extract more value out of it because

244
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,200
they they offer this service

245
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,320
for almost nothing it is it is i think

246
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,440
10 euros per kid to use the software and

247
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
to have sufficient computers in a in in

248
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,839
a class to be to be using this which

249
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,160
cannot be the cost to google of offering

250
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,920
this service i believe

251
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,880
um

252
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
and i think it's it's a it's a basic

253
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
right for kids to to make their own

254
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,560
mistakes but also to be forgotten

255
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
especially at at that age

256
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
um

257
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,120
yeah and and we also think that

258
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,440
you know digitization in in education

259
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,560
maybe

260
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
researched a bit more before being used

261
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,959
at such an extensive scale because we

262
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,399
think face-to-face

263
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,120
education is something that might really

264
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
work work well

265
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,200
and the school yeah like i said is is

266
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
very understandably also not really on

267
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
top of things you know so they they

268
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,600
teach kids about the dangers of social

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,240
media and and you know things like i

270
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
don't know sexting or people making

271
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,959
issues but but the danger of using

272
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,360
digital services without really knowing

273
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
what is being shared is is not really

274
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,279
something that is uh done and and

275
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,720
there's lots of cool things that kids

276
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
could do with digital stuff like

277
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,600
programming

278
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,800
you know uh and and and and just you

279
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,640
know being more creative which is which

280
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,880
is not really done yet at school so we

281
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,000
think uh

282
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
yeah we we were a bit concerned and

283
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
that's how we sort of joined the

284
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,040
coalition for uh uh honest digital

285
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,760
education which yeah yeah

286
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
some people

287
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,000
people came together um we started on

288
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,399
the forum of freedom internet there were

289
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,079
lots of people that were worried about

290
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,680
what's going on in schools and where the

291
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
data was going and who had access and

292
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,839
why

293
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,079
but instead of all being angry

294
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,760
we decided to well

295
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,839
just let's do something let's try to fix

296
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,560
it

297
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,240
and from there we started with the

298
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,880
coalition for fair digital education

299
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,959
that's the indus coalition for ireland

300
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,959
unfortunately fortunately we're not

301
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,390
alone

302
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,880
[Music]

303
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,160
can you do the

304
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,360
clicky

305
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,079
feedback we have quite some

306
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,680
organizations that are supporting us in

307
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,079
this in this mission to

308
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,480
to take back the educational system from

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,200
from big tech basically

310
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
i'm not going to name them all but some

311
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,199
ex

312
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,079
and just a few examples that uh

313
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
for instance free software foundation

314
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,440
that is quite quite involved

315
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,040
freedom internet because we started on

316
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
the on the forum of

317
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,959
freedom internet and

318
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,200
a couple of

319
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
a while ago we launched our petition on

320
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,239
the conference of public spaces

321
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,560
well first something about the dutch

322
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,079
digitals

323
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,880
not

324
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
about the dutch

325
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,920
educational system because it's slightly

326
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,560
different than uh in the most european

327
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
countries

328
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,320
we have in the netherlands we have the

329
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,480
freedom of education that's basically

330
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
that the school does pay for the

331
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
for the school the government is paying

332
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
for the schools but the schools organize

333
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,800
themselves or basically it's a way for

334
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,680
confessionalists to do their own kind of

335
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,399
indoctrination

336
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,519
um sometimes i have sources in

337
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,680
links to sources in this documentation

338
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,279
in this presentation that are not in

339
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,760
english but you can use a service like

340
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,480
depot for that

341
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
okay what's wrong with surveillance

342
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,200
capitalism well a lot

343
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
is basically a threat to our democracy

344
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
if we want to have a free society

345
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,600
a free and liberal liberal this society

346
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,519
and democratic society

347
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,000
we cannot have surveillance capitalism

348
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
it's a problem that's growing it's

349
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,600
feeding uh polarization

350
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,920
algorithms are optimized for for for

351
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,320
engagement instead of so they try to

352
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
check your intention as long as possible

353
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,519
entire business models based upon

354
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
collecting collecting harvesting data

355
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,920
extracting conclusions about

356
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
i'm sorry making conclusions about

357
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,519
the data they gathered and combined and

358
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,040
all together

359
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,959
and what's also wrong is it's a

360
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,680
privatization of a collective effort let

361
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,959
me explain that if we all together uh

362
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,720
train some kind of

363
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,680
training algorithm

364
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
then the result of that training should

365
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,079
be belong in the public domain and not

366
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,000
uh be part of

367
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,040
some kind of big corporate

368
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,120
and also the long-term consequences for

369
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,670
kids are not very clear

370
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,740
[Music]

371
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,199
vector clouds are

372
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,959
far from fish software

373
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,639
you can't really see what's happening in

374
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,360
the in the cloud

375
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
i'm sorry

376
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,839
um

377
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
they're not used

378
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,199
you can't

379
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,519
okay free software has a gives you three

380
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,959
four freedoms none of those four

381
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
freedoms are available for in the cloud

382
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,639
because you can't download the software

383
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,800
you can't use it for any any purpose you

384
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,680
can't modify it you can't

385
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,240
you can't adapt it and redistribute it

386
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
if you want to want to have all these

387
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
possibilities we should be stopped using

388
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,279
a big tech class

389
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,399
also important reminder there is no

390
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
cloud just just computers of someone

391
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,560
else and you can run capacity there and

392
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,680
deploy

393
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,519
some software or get some default

394
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,000
services

395
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,079
yeah but there's no real cloud it's in

396
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,440
the end it's just computer somewhere

397
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,680
else

398
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,920
[Music]

399
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,639
okay let me do a quick introduction of

400
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,399
the gdpr because that's quite an

401
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,279
important topic in this

402
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,920
in this matter

403
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,920
for processing data you have

404
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,519
six

405
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,240
legal grounds for which you can

406
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,800
process data first is consent that is if

407
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,759
you agree to

408
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
that your data is used for a certain

409
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,519
purpose the problem with consent is that

410
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,600
you can always withdraw at any moment so

411
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,199
that's not a

412
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
not a very useful basis to process data

413
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,279
if you want if you

414
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,199
if you basically have your school you

415
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,040
can't certainly stop processing so

416
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
that's why schools never ask for for

417
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
consent

418
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,720
the second one is if we make an

419
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,639
agreement

420
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,639
for instance if uh i'm gonna work as a

421
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,320
network designer if i make a design for

422
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,519
you

423
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,040
then i can send you an invoice i don't

424
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,480
need to have your

425
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,040
uh consent to to to be able to send the

426
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,000
send the invoice to you

427
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,599
excuse me

428
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,759
there's also

429
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,079
lots of laws that make that require that

430
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,040
you

431
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
send data

432
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,399
fourth is

433
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,639
vital interest if you're dying somewhere

434
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
and don't need to ask your consent to

435
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,959
check your blood type or some

436
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,800
something like that

437
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,199
um there's common interest that's mainly

438
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,600
government that's using that for uh for

439
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,240
for processing data for instance if a

440
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,000
municipality wants to hand cameras in

441
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
the public space for security that's

442
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
come based upon the common

443
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
interest

444
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,399
and you have the legitimate interest

445
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,959
that is if i make a balance between your

446
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,560
privacy and my

447
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,639
my interest for instance if i run a web

448
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,600
server it produces logs i can keep those

449
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
locks because that's

450
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,439
in my interest to be able to do

451
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,199
troubleshooting and stuff like that that

452
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,039
can be based upon legitimate interest

453
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,559
but a problem with surveillance

454
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,520
capitalism is that complying is not a

455
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
real business interest you can make more

456
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,359
money if you do not comply and try to

457
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,678
stretch the gdpr as far as possible

458
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,200
i see mainly three large problems with

459
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,840
the gdpr first of all

460
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,559
there's the consent

461
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,320
what basically comes down is that you

462
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
have all this annoying cookie banners

463
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,280
that you have to click on

464
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
okay or you're being tricked in clicking

465
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,960
on ok and if you if you would want to

466
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,400
read it

467
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,360
there's a lot of legally legalized uh

468
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,480
stuff

469
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,840
that's very hard to read and you don't

470
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
have the time

471
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
and even if you have the time is the

472
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,640
is

473
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,480
they're not very transparent in what's

474
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,640
actually done so

475
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,799
it's difficult to see what is this uh

476
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,559
what what the consequences of it are

477
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,640
authorities are very understaffed and

478
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,640
underfunded to properly enforce the gdpr

479
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
and what is important in uh in schools

480
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,320
with

481
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,919
the gdpr is that your parents are

482
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,919
allowed to know almost everything until

483
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,160
your age of 16.

484
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,120
so

485
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,600
can you do it next

486
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,160
um

487
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,679
well the enforcement

488
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,960
authorities are

489
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,559
are under understaffed it's not that

490
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
they don't want to enforce but they

491
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,440
don't have the budget they don't have

492
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,640
the staff

493
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
and in my opinion they should also be

494
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
more clever in automating things on how

495
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,760
they uh

496
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,480
i mean you can for nice examples of the

497
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
security cameras that everybody just

498
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
looks up points at the public streets

499
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
that's not allowed to do that on the

500
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
gdpr especially not if you did not

501
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,320
properly secure it it's a chinese camera

502
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,600
material

503
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,919
but what other authority

504
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,320
authorities are doing is responding to

505
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,000
individual complaint about the specific

506
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,960
camera

507
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,360
well you have on openstreetmap you have

508
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
thousands of cameras that are already

509
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,240
there and you can see that uh

510
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,000
that they're pointing on the on the

511
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
street you can automate that you can

512
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
send everybody automated to warning but

513
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,120
your your camera is not compliant

514
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,080
[Music]

515
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,799
um another very important thing is

516
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,520
privacy by design that's part of the

517
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,799
gdpr

518
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,840
but it's not enforced at all

519
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,960
i mean

520
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
you can't call all the google services

521
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,559
privacy by design

522
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,640
i mean their data extraction and

523
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,480
profiling by design

524
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,679
and then try to make it make a

525
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,559
make a

526
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,840
rich

527
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,600
the theoretical

528
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,240
documents to make it seem compliant to

529
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
the gdpr but it's not

530
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,919
it cannot be because it's not privacy by

531
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,080
design privacy by design is that you

532
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
collect

533
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
only data you really need

534
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,280
delete it when you don't

535
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,080
don't need it anymore

536
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,840
and protect it very very well

537
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,400
another nice example is those

538
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
advertising ids they promise in a legal

539
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,200
document they won't be building profiles

540
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,919
but in schools even the

541
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,000
chromebooks and microsoft computers they

542
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,640
still have advertising id

543
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,919
you can

544
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,320
reset it if you do that

545
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,480
which but maybe someone occasionally

546
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,360
does but yeah the profiling just

547
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,918
continues

548
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,159
luckily we're not alone in this uh in

549
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,799
this battle against uh

550
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,440
for for for better privacy enforcement

551
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,120
there's none of your business the

552
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,600
organization by mark schrems they're

553
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,200
still doing a tremendous job in

554
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,440
using automated tools also automated

555
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,360
tools to basically

556
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,080
have here the cookie cookie banners this

557
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,679
is a cookie

558
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,360
banner with a with a dark pattern

559
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
there's a

560
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,600
highlighted green button that you're

561
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,200
supposed to click immediately because

562
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,440
that's the most easy solution and if you

563
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,039
want to reject it you first have to open

564
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,200
the policy and then maybe do another

565
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,760
dozen clicks as opposed to this is the

566
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,919
way you should do it if you use cookies

567
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,320
for more than strictly necessary

568
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
you just click on reject all if you

569
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,080
don't like to have that

570
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
but this the the fun thing about this

571
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
project is they automated it they sent

572
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,880
down they sent thousands of described

573
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,400
the most popular

574
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,120
websites in the india that are used in

575
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,840
the eu and send them automated warnings

576
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
for your your cookie banner is not

577
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,080
compliant

578
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,039
and consent

579
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,159
is a nice uh button so you get again uh

580
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,440
for instance

581
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,360
let's stick to the cookie banner example

582
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,840
if you open the

583
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,559
the the terms and conditions of the

584
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,559
privacy statements you get

585
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,600
often very complicated to read very long

586
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,919
documents with a lot of blah blah

587
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,760
you you don't have the time if you have

588
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
the time you probably don't have to you

589
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,559
really just

590
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,880
you um

591
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
legal knowledge to fully understand it

592
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,600
and maybe you don't have the technical

593
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,480
uh

594
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,240
understanding of what exactly can be

595
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,520
done with data so what do you do

596
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,320
you click the accept burden

597
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,360
like everybody does because you can't

598
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,280
read all of those documents it's too too

599
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,720
much

600
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,240
and they made it very difficult to uh

601
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
to read all the stuff

602
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,120
i'll just grab a bit of water

603
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,240
what are some shortcuts you can take

604
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
if you read a

605
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
privacy statement there's a few things

606
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,640
you should be looking at

607
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
first thing is

608
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,080
we don't use the data for well i don't

609
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,840
care what you're not doing i want to

610
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,679
know what you are doing because if you

611
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,679
don't

612
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,799
uh

613
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,240
the the things they've described that

614
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,960
they're not doing that's always the very

615
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,039
bad thing that that that you uh think is

616
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,720
very good that they're not doing it so

617
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,919
you're

618
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,640
you're

619
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,600
you're feeling a bit more comfortable

620
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,039
another nice one is for example

621
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,200
we use the data for example to provide

622
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,120
you this website

623
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,480
no one's going to object that

624
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,840
but

625
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,520
the thing is that

626
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,440
this is not complete

627
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,039
it's just an example to make you feel

628
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,919
good

629
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,200
but the other things are not told

630
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,640
and also a nice one is in the end

631
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,520
probably if uh you've all seen that

632
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,679
uh this statement can change all that

633
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,760
can change any time

634
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,679
so if it can change any time you've been

635
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,080
reading it and then it says

636
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,960
it can it can change every time so

637
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,320
what's the point in reading it the

638
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,600
moment i click it away it could be

639
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,520
changed

640
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,120
and i needed to check again and again

641
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,039
and again if you change it but they

642
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,880
should be informing me that something

643
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
has changed

644
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,520
um another one is uh selected this we

645
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,440
don't sell your data we only share it

646
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
with selected business partners you can

647
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,080
translate that as just anyone who wants

648
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,320
to sell it wants to buy it

649
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,960
so that's bad

650
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,279
fortunately there's also examples that

651
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,200
do good in how the

652
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
uh

653
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,400
our privacy statement looks like a good

654
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,480
privacy statement is short simple and

655
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,120
understandable

656
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,600
it comes down to we use your data to

657
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,279
reuse your data to provide you this in

658
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,320
this service that's it

659
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,760
well there's a few companies that have

660
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,919
nice examples about that i won't be

661
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,559
standing in front of that

662
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,120
one i love one one that i love really

663
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,039
much is uh

664
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,880
is this one it's an open cut that's a

665
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,640
security scanning tool

666
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,279
that's uh renault winter

667
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,320
in

668
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,960
in

669
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,000
corona pandemic made to scan all the

670
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,520
testing streets for

671
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,559
for compliance and for security

672
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,240
this is the entire

673
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
privacy statement of the website about

674
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,159
this tool

675
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,080
it's so short it just fits in two

676
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,400
languages on a single slide

677
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,159
basically it's in dutch it's a one-liner

678
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,000
in english it's it's became became two

679
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,279
lines but

680
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
that's really how you should do it don't

681
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,000
collect more data than you need

682
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
and then think really good about what

683
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,279
what you actually need not

684
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,880
collecting things that might come in

685
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,159
handy

686
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,919
then the gdpr age

687
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,520
it's legal if you're under 16 it's legal

688
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,360
that all your parents know everything

689
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,480
but if you ask a kid

690
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,760
if he likes it if ask a 13 14 year old

691
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,520
if he likes it that the that his parents

692
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,360
are immediately informed he was late in

693
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
school they don't make his homework

694
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,240
forgot his book et cetera

695
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,480
but the netherlands 80 percent of the

696
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,120
secondary schools use magister that's a

697
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,720
tool to track

698
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,400
if you're not late made your homework

699
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,039
book for cotton all your grades etc and

700
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
they have a very handy app for parents

701
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,200
that you can immediately ping if

702
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,320
something

703
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,120
some new information is added

704
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,799
well

705
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
and default setting is that parents can

706
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,400
see everything only skulls

707
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
school really needs to

708
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,760
change this default setting to not

709
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,360
informing the parents immediately if

710
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,919
they want to have that

711
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,840
but legally speaking there's no problem

712
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,799
because you're under 16.

713
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,679
um

714
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
something a little bit more on the old

715
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,240
machister is basically a student or a

716
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,159
pupil tracking system with a big

717
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,279
centralized database

718
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,039
the problem with with this very big

719
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,520
centralized database is that

720
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,360
um

721
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,480
it's

722
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,919
it's basically

723
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,919
the information of an entire generation

724
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,559
and their school behavior is in one

725
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,159
database so if you want to know

726
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,080
something about someone

727
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,000
you know it's in that database probably

728
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,159
so

729
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,919
there's all kinds of foreign uh

730
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,520
three letter agencies that are very

731
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,360
interested in knowing

732
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,200
very much about

733
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,919
specific individuals individuals in

734
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,000
from country

735
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,120
i can

736
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,760
one back please

737
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,960
so

738
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,279
the question you should be asking is not

739
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,360
the chance that this interest falls on

740
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,720
your kid it's maybe very small but

741
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,200
um

742
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,279
in the entire population there will be

743
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,279
kids that are that will attract

744
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,120
attention maybe because they've become a

745
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,200
terrorist or a criminal but

746
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,279
maybe they because they become a

747
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,679
politician or a negotiator

748
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,840
or a ceo of some company then suddenly

749
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,039
they have

750
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,120
the interest of secret services from

751
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,050
abroad

752
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,119
[Music]

753
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,679
[Music]

754
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,760
is 80

755
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,360
apart from privacy in the data

756
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,039
collection

757
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,200
and the centralization

758
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
it's also a huge fender lock-in it's

759
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
quite difficult to migrate to some kind

760
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
of kind of other system and it's hugely

761
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,880
overpriced

762
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,520
if you look at the market share

763
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,559
that's around 70 to 80 percent

764
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,600
but we have 900 000 uh kids that are

765
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
going to secondary school if you

766
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,080
calculate that with the price per year

767
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,918
that they're doing that's 12 million

768
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,039
per year

769
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,480
so

770
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,399
imagine if those schools would put this

771
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,240
money together and run the development

772
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,080
team instead of

773
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,559
keep paying licenses year after year

774
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,200
after year that with prices that keep

775
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,240
increasing and increasing

776
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,120
well we talked a lot about privacy now

777
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,240
but privacy is a lot is is very

778
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,320
important

779
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,559
public value but there's more public

780
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,559
values so please discuss with your

781
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,320
neighbor what other public values there

782
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,440
are then

783
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,760
then only privacy can you take two

784
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,879
minutes to really think about that

785
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,559
so

786
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,960
uh

787
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,520
anyone who wants to share some

788
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,559
anyone wants to share

789
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,720
other public failures that are uh

790
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,240
important to have in schools

791
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,640
you want to learn from it

792
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,919
yeah you want to study the code and

793
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,440
learn from so that's transparency you

794
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,640
want to see what's happening in the

795
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,519
cloud good anyone else

796
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,159
political views

797
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,640
political views

798
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,760
yeah i said political views because

799
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
children are immersed in uh certain

800
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,640
ideas and

801
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,320
yeah and i don't want anyone to know

802
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,399
that but that's again privacy uh again i

803
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,840
won't

804
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
anyone

805
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,799
else

806
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,720
also need to go on because we are

807
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,919
equality yeah that's a good one this one

808
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,200
is on the list here

809
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,799
but they need

810
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,480
public domain if you create something

811
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,240
if you if you train an algorithm you do

812
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,840
that with a million people then the

813
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
results of the algorithm that should be

814
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,639
public domain

815
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,279
also autonomy is very important how can

816
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,200
you be yourself if you wonder what this

817
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,880
algorithm is learning about you i mean

818
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,640
you go to school to learn that you as a

819
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,120
as a student that you learn

820
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,799
but not that the algorithm is learning

821
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,399
about you that's the other way around

822
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,760
also equality there's a lot of

823
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,480
adaptive learning systems but they

824
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,559
mainly work very well for

825
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,480
children that are already motivated and

826
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,320
very good in self-disciplined and

827
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,519
working

828
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,360
not for the other ones because there is

829
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,640
so you increase the the the gap between

830
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,840
the already motivated good good students

831
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
versus the one that needs a need a

832
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,840
little help and a bit of a push

833
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,440
um it's also

834
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,039
if all this knowledge and all this power

835
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,480
for the entire generation is in uh

836
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,240
is in the hands of a few

837
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,919
if for a very few uh small group

838
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,880
and then that's a threat to democracy

839
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,039
if you know so much about so many people

840
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,120
it's very easy to manipulate to

841
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,880
transport uh

842
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
bump around fake news to gain their

843
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
attention to hold their intention to

844
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,799
push their attention to where you want

845
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,879
to have it as a organization

846
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,840
so who owns the spell

847
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,519
checker i'd say if it's public effort it

848
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,720
should be public benefit

849
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,880
so google and microsoft both have a

850
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,320
really good spelling checker but it

851
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
became so good because they harvested

852
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,039
all our corrections

853
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,519
so why isn't it the public domain spell

854
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,919
checker

855
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,360
schools should be a safe space you

856
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,279
should be you should be feel free you

857
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,720
should not be wondering what

858
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,640
what the algorithm is learning about you

859
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
i'm going to for the time i'm going to

860
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,919
skip a few slides

861
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,679
democracy i'm not going to skip that's a

862
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,200
very important one

863
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,520
the people that stormed the capital on

864
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,119
6th of january

865
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,440
those were people people were using

866
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,119
facebook groups they were using youtube

867
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,560
and youtube

868
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,719
also provides you with a next more

869
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,800
radical more uh

870
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,520
uh

871
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,199
movie as soon as you're interested in a

872
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,040
sudden uh

873
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,399
subject you continue uh

874
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,000
it will continue to provide you with

875
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,918
more and more of this uh

876
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,560
on the on this subject you're just going

877
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,879
into

878
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,399
transparency we've already had

879
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,560
in summary gdpr is good but it should be

880
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,679
enforced

881
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,440
and it's not enough because it's not the

882
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,520
only public fail you have

883
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,000
privacy is important and that's what the

884
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,239
gdpr is doing a good thing but we should

885
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,479
have

886
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,119
schools should look at the entire

887
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,359
package of public values not only

888
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,560
privacy and not only gdpr compliance

889
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,839
it matters what you teach children if

890
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,160
you teach children to use

891
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,680
all those services of surveillance

892
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,400
capitalists then that's what they'll use

893
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,359
as soon as even if you within the school

894
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,960
make sure that everything is legally

895
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,920
compliant and you assume that they even

896
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,200
although they're in the business of

897
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,240
stretching the gdpr and expanding their

898
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,760
space to use data as much as possible

899
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,920
as soon as school goes to pick up their

900
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,240
phone

901
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
and accept any terms and conditions that

902
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,359
are that are connected to that and now

903
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,800
they won't read the policies then

904
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,160
because i learned in school that these

905
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,440
are good services

906
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,480
this is what you can use

907
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,839
[Music]

908
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,440
i'm going to skip this one as well

909
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,680
kenneth nets also having quite some good

910
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,040
recommendations on how you can use

911
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,040
google microsoft products in school

912
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
but it's also very impractical for a

913
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,599
school

914
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,119
i mean um

915
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,720
then you have a computer that can do all

916
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,640
those fantastic things and we as a

917
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,079
population made for instance the

918
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,839
spelling check are very good but then

919
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,760
you read the recommendations of

920
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,920
afghanistan on how to use it privacy

921
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,599
friendly and then you cannot use the

922
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,960
spelling checker

923
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,040
i mean that's absurd we made it and now

924
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,960
we can't even use it because

925
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,040
then our privacy will be violated and

926
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,640
it's not according to the gdpr

927
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,720
another one is for microsoft

928
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,560
you must make sure that in the entire

929
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,400
school nobody is going to install a

930
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,160
mobile app

931
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,960
you should only use the desktop

932
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,160
these are recommendations from

933
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,839
from canada's net on how you can work

934
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,040
gdpr compliance so that's not the way we

935
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,520
should be going

936
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,200
well are schools nuts that they give all

937
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,000
the data of the children away no

938
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
they don't have the

939
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,560
time knowledge and money to build their

940
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,160
own environment so we should be helping

941
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,799
them with that

942
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,800
and the good thing is we don't have to

943
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
start from scratch because there's lots

944
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
and lots of very good open source tools

945
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,480
the only thing is that they're

946
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
they're not yet integrated in complete

947
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,599
package that can go to school

948
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,680
this is an example of uh

949
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,040
of german organization universion

950
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,119
to do identity access management and

951
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,720
they link to lots of other open source

952
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,598
tools so you can

953
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,800
you can you can it's really doable to

954
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,240
base your

955
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,640
digital system completely upon open

956
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,720
source tools

957
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,240
this is another example that they'll

958
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,839
skip

959
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,359
so

960
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,599
what i want to do

961
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,119
is make sure that out of all these

962
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,880
building blocks we get to get it

963
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,119
together and make a nice package that we

964
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,800
solve the problem for the school make it

965
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,960
easy that they can get a service to get

966
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,920
service and the sla and support and

967
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,800
integration and training for a fixed

968
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,599
price for per

969
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,560
per student or per pupil

970
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,839
well we have three ways of doing that

971
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,400
first is um well let's just build it

972
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,160
let's show it on a few schools that it

973
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,480
is possible and doable

974
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,000
and then a

975
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,640
lobby for political political attention

976
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,119
to get get support for this

977
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,119
and also legal by

978
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,040
make sure making sure that

979
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,839
gdpr is properly enforced

980
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,119
well how we're going to build that it's

981
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,960
a matter of looking abroad i mean in

982
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,119
germany in luxembourg in france there

983
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,960
are four fantastic

984
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,079
produ

985
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,440
deployments with

986
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,520
with next cloud but also other open

987
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,760
source tools that are used in school on

988
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,359
a very large scale

989
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,359
so it's possible and doable

990
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,560
roughly there are four parts to a school

991
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,160
and it environment you have the generic

992
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,440
generic cloud environment

993
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,000
you have the student administration you

994
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,720
have the hardware in class and you have

995
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,839
the educational material

996
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,839
currently we have we're doing a pilot in

997
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,760
two schools in amsterdam there's our

998
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,240
primary schools they have a next next

999
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,520
cloud as a

1000
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,240
as a idea environment and all the

1001
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,880
communication with with parents is

1002
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,920
using signal for that

1003
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,240
next cloud is done by one of our

1004
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,319
supporters with from the next cloud

1005
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,359
that's it

1006
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,720
so next up

1007
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,720
is

1008
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,280
we have a petition on um

1009
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,200
digital underwise

1010
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,359
spontaneous you can scan scan this qr

1011
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,640
code or go to the url directly i'll

1012
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,520
give you a bigger one

1013
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,599
sorry was there a question

1014
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,920
okay

1015
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,119
but there's also other good news on the

1016
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,319
legal

1017
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,960
legal side of things last week denmark

1018
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,240
has forbidden

1019
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
the use of google products in google

1020
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,560
workspace in the municipality of

1021
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,200
elsinger but they've done that on a very

1022
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,359
generic base

1023
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,440
the ground for this is that data

1024
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,240
transfers from europe to usa are not

1025
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,640
allowed and that's applicable for

1026
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,400
a lot of other

1027
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,240
of these

1028
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,880
surveillance capitalists

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,800
also

1030
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,520
office 365 is the authorities who said

1031
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,599
that that's not usable for in schools in

1032
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,560

1033

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,000
you have to read things before you click

1052
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,359
and

1053
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,640
most important

1054
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,280
if you are if you have a school or work

1055
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
for school

1056
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,880
let the school join

1057
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
say as a school that we want to have a

1058
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,800
digital environment that's based upon

1059
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,200
public values

1060
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,079
so

1061
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,280
anyone has a question

1062
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,380
[Applause]

1063
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,000
[Music]

1064
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,640
i think enforcement is a

1065
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,359
large part of the whole gdpr are

1066
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,440
you willing to work for the

1067
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,920
authentic

1068
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,760
as what as a lawyer or

1069
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,480
as a techie as a person who want to

1070
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,400
automate

1071
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,119
the stuff you talked about

1072
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,440
i'll consider it

1073
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,359
and the second question is shouldn't we

1074
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,799
just hack machester

1075
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,800
ah but hacking that's illegal

1076
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,119
it force that uh it would give a nice

1077
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,800
candle yes

1078
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,960
all right thanks for talk uh

1079
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,280
do you think it is possible in now in

1080
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,599
five years to have open source solutions

1081
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,400
and

1082
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,480
service providers that

1083
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,400
are willing to

1084
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,119
uh yeah more in in privacy matter and

1085
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,440
and provide schools with to correct

1086
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,760
solutions to

1087
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,970
have the children

1088
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,400
[Music]

1089
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,359
well they better get started now

1090
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,480
because in denmark those schools there

1091
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,040
they have two weeks to ditch google

1092
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,680
and not years when two weeks

1093
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
imagine your school you have everything

1094
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,920
on the google workspace and authorities

1095
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,760
say ah now you can't use it and in two

1096
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,119
weeks you should have deleted all your

1097
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,640
data

1098
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,760
so

1099
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,839
it's very wise to start now

1100
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,160
yeah there are open source solutions

1101
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,079
that provide the same

1102
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,560
possibilities as google

1103
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,640
and microsoft solutions too it will not

1104
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,200
be immediately on par but if you look at

1105
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:25,920
the

1106
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,200
next

1107
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,119
for instance nexcloud

1108
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,560
yeah you have uh

1109
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,000
you have a cloud environment where you

1110
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,400
can work work together and you can have

1111
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,040
lots of plugins for for schools

1112
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
it's doable there's all in germany there

1113
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,800
are already schools working i mean

1114
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,240
there's hundreds of thousands of

1115
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
students that are being migrated from

1116
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,440
office 365 to next cloud

1117
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,839
okay thank you yeah it's possible

1118
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,760
would it be a good idea to teach the

1119
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,599
teachers

1120
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,720
that's a very good idea yeah can can the

1121
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,079
hackers help

1122
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,400
to if they have children on school that

1123
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,839
they

1124
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,040
give the teachers a short course in in

1125
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,800
things like this

1126
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,520
there's an organization in

1127
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,680
austria that has a very german name that

1128
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,319
cannot go that's exactly doing this

1129
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,280
teacher

1130
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,119
one of the things sorry

1131
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,280
then i'm finished one of the things

1132
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,079
which should be clarified is that open

1133
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,160
source is not free

1134
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,800
it does cost money yeah

1135
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,200
it's not gratis it's free it's free it's

1136
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,119
in freedom but not just free isn't no

1137
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,119
money that's true now you have to pay

1138
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,119
for the people who develop things but

1139
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,720
it's open for for improvements

1140
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,760
so

1141
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,520
that's a big difference they think that

1142
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,040
they get

1143
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,119
everything free but it's not true

1144
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,079
so um let me just jump in here so that

1145
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,359
what you're looking for is cause

1146
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,359
marchule

1147
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,079
chaos does schools they go into schools

1148
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,040
and teach teachers and kids and parents

1149
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,680
about all things online et cetera et

1150
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,480
cetera like whom do you trust on the web

1151
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,319
what how much information one do you

1152
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,079

1153
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,040

board of schools says we are going to

1159
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,920
base everything upon these public values

1160
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,920
and not only privacy but also

1161
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,680

1166
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,880
question thanks for the presentation um

1167
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,200
when it comes to climate change a lot of

1168
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,440
youngsters are very much aware that it's

1169
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,119
about their future

1170
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,920
are you aware of any pupil driven

1171
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,200
efforts to

1172
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,920
make this statement of yours

1173
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,000
and do it in public do it in their

1174
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,240
schools do it at a

1175
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,359
well

1176
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,720
theoretical court i don't know

1177
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,280
not organized but

1178
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,119
i think that would be a very powerful

1179
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,560
statement

1180
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,400
but yeah if you can help me

1181
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,960
to i i mean i talk to my own kids but uh

1182
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,920
usually only to to warn them about uh

1183
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,480
the situation now but uh don't hear much

1184
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,960
other initiatives uh from that that are

1185
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,359
coming from uh from case

1186
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,200
okay thanks

1187
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,040
next question please we we have a few

1188
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,440
minutes i want to get all in

1189
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,839
i was wondering if legally

1190
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:34,640
it's

1191
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,800
uh the students or their parents can

1192
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,400
refuse the use of chromebooks or

1193
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,280
microsoft online stuff

1194
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,599
for schools or for extras

1195
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,000
activities just outside of schools

1196
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,760
is there a legal basis where they could

1197
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,520
say no i don't want to create a google

1198
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,440
account or no because then you're

1199
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,000
that's only possible if you would be

1200
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,480
based upon consent but they just make an

1201
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,200
agreement to provide id services and

1202
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,040
they have a processing agreement with

1203
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,440
those providers of which they claim that

1204
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,800
it's legally or all okay so as a parent

1205
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
you have nothing to say in it

1206
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,960
unless you go to court and

1207
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,160
proceed

1208
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,280
all the way until that's uh yeah now you

1209
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,040
have to take your school to court but

1210
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,920
that's not a really nice solution

1211
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,559
so the parents have to agree to the use

1212
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,359
of google services when putting their

1213
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,599
children to school or no they don't the

1214
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,680
parents do not have to agree because the

1215
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,118
school makes a agreement

1216
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,720
now well that as a as a parent you have

1217
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,760
agreed

1218
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,839
that the school provides everything they

1219
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,640
need for education and that is of course

1220
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,920
a very broad um you know understanding

1221
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,720
and then the school says we need google

1222
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,920
services for education and by that you

1223
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,680
have consented at the beginning of the

1224
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,440
year when you have enrolled so the

1225
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,240
school should make it of public before

1226
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,319
people register their kids there that

1227
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,400
they will be their data will be sent to

1228
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,319
google should that be

1229
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,800
explicit when people register their kids

1230
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,720
to school

1231
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,720
it's uh you know with our kids

1232
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,880
you know when they were at school they

1233
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,119
introduced google and they introduced

1234
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,040
seven other apps that

1235
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
you know so it's uh then difficult and

1236
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,400
they say we need this for our education

1237
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,480
so it's difficult yeah and i do have to

1238
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,920
interject here because we're running

1239
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,839
enough time please come up to the

1240
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,160
speakers afterwards uh grab a drink at

1241
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,839

1242
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,400
