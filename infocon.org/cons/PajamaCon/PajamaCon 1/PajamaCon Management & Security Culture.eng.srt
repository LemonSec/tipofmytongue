00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,920
some seen a very similar quote um

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,079
said to speak from the heart because i

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,600
don't necessarily

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,520
stick to slides the best um i like

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,399
um interaction even though this topic

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,600
isn't super interactive per se

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,520
um so yeah so

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,120
management and security culture and

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
actually touches upon what you know a

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,839
lot of

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,760
what chloe said and also what some of

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,320
what danielle had touched upon

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,239
so my educational background is in

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,439
business

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:11,280
um to give you an example

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,119
but i wasn't so great at you know

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,479
i didn't jive so well with the wall

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,680
street type culture

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,280
in new york being a business person

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,479
and i learned the importance of

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,000
culture through that experience less of

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,320
a suit and tie type of

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,759
hand shape um you know how do you do

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,439
more than like

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,000
um alice bob and you know mallory or

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,798
um sometimes they use a different

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,840
terminal

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,840
yeah anyway um so

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,040
i work a lot with startups and i wanted

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,880
to to share some stories about

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,799
how hr and all the steps of the

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,360
processes with the tight-knit

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,439
connect tight-knit group has to do with

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,320
um

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,880
productivity and security and how they

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,079
go hand-in-hand very much as decisions

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,119
continue to be made

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,759
from the ground up because things could

52
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,038
very well

53
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,480
completely fail in every aspect of a

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,399
startup

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,840
so um so it starts with hiring

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,440
um a lot of it is from staff retention

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
you got to be able to get along with

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,079
them but at the same time

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,080
not enough care to to fear pissing them

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,319
off to the point where

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,239
you will not be honest with each other

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,119
and you will not be

63
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,319
transparent and anyone who does anything

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,920
with you know devsak ops or any sort of

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,200
project management will know

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,599
how important continuous feedback is

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,958
not only for you know technical and

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,440
security metrics but

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:55,200
also for business metrics and

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,400
team productivity metrics so

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,440
a lot of that kind of transferred

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,239
to learning that um so

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,720
a lot of hr and recruitment sometimes is

74
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,560
it

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,680
outsourced to um you know start up

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,800
job boards for roles that you know a

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,440
given ceo

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,560
can't fill on with within their network

79
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,920
and that eliminates you know

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,879
some of the trust and some of the

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,958
incentives

82
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,319
to do a good job for the startup rather

83
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,599
than going for

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,879
just a set salary which is there

85
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,720
because humans are humans and especially

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,280
with remote work which is obviously more

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,239
prevalent during covid

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
and all of that has to you know affects

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,360
decision makes things in general it

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,640
affects developers

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,879
you know tendency to listen to security

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,559
advice from the security expert whether

93
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,040
it's an official role

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,840
or whether it's just kind of a volunteer

95
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,599
member of the

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,080
team stepping in to become the

97
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,518
security champion is often the term i've

98
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,959
heard

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,400
and um so a lot

100
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:17,040
can really kind of go wrong

101
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:22,079
just on that front and of itself

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:25,759
and so again it starts with

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,199
recruitment i don't know how many of you

104
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
have ever worked with

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,600
something just completely from the

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,280
ground up a startup or even just

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,479
a volunteer project that's not security

108
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,799
specific

109
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,280
and somebody will just say you do the

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,800
security and not know what they meant

111
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,239
that person you know as a manager

112
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
would would then at least have to listen

113
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,000
to the person with the security

114
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,400
knowledge how

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,680
you know when they try to explain what

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,919
that means

117
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040
and gently you know correct any

118
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,000
misunderstandings

119
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,080
on anybody's points and also again take

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,039
feedback and try to be on the same page

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:12,240
with the developers or with

122
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:16,400
um whatever other role

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:20,080
it is for a given task at hand

124
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,120
and because at the end of the day

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,520
the human element being a factor which

126
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
is

127
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,198
i often find you know here said

128
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,240
insecurity as far as

129
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,800
team dynamics is also

130
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,360
the same as far as getting really

131
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
anything

132
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,440
accomplished so which which draws upon

133
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,280
mental health

134
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,639
too as chloe said so

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,599
again understanding what you don't

136
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,080
understand for any given role

137
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,520
and continuing to check in so every

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,800
other aspect of project

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,039
management is of uh most important

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,400
in making secure development decisions

141
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,440
secure

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,638
you know other operations monitoring

143
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:09,600
monitoring and measuring accordingly

144
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,600
and also um

145
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,198
you know um

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,520
and also all of any

147
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
all of testing especially when it has to

148
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,799
be done in a very

149
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,799
inexpensive lightweight manner

150
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,198
and so some of the management specific

151
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
con concepts that i i've applied are

152
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,479
management structures um i don't know if

153
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,000
any of you are familiar

154
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,280
with the inverted pyramid

155
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,120
which is rather than a top-down approach

156
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
so i'll start with the top-down approach

157
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,080
um so

158
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,880
top-down approach is a manager

159
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,758
has everyone working under him or her

160
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,080
reporting to that to that person in some

161
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,680
sort of hierarchy

162
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,800
and an inverted pyramid

163
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,039
is when people

164
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
and you know the lower downs were doing

165
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,599
more specific

166
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,800
roles kind of have

167
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,919
say in every process to kind of

168
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,360
guide management in a nutshell

169
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,960
and some combination of the two

170
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,520
somewhere in between i feel like

171
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,599
you know and deciding on a project on a

172
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,080
per project basis

173
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:37,360
is really key because every every um

174
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,560
security secure development

175
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,520
process really is you know

176
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,120
is collaborative especially when

177
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,120
everyone's wearing multiple hats

178
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,599
not intended but

179
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:02,560
so secured um

180
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,599
and getting hands-on and displaying care

181
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,840
empathy is often measured

182
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,800
mentioned as one of the human ele the

183
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,039
important

184
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:17,680
human elements in devsecops

185
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,080
um but it's also facilitating

186
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
cheap talk and you know kind of

187
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,758
communication just for the

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
sake of communication so that there's

189
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,599
organic

190
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
flow and organic free-flowing thoughts

191
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,080
just as far as culture

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,680
because it works you know any social

193
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,800
scientific factors

194
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:42,000
just having a you know an

195
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:46,160
open culture of flowful conversation

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,760
in every regard again with with trust

197
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,360
um and you know it's obviously

198
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,519
kind of different when everyone's in

199
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,839
different departments i've never really

200
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,920
worked in a large corporation it's

201
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,959
always been smaller teams

202
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,079
but it's it's

203
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:08,079
it's very very important

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:12,880
and really any opportunity for

205
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:15,839
for feedback or or further cooperation

206
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,839
is very important making sure everyone's

207
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,240
on the same page

208
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,320
to some extent where possible as long as

209
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,800
there are

210
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,720
skills again especially for a bunch of

211
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,680
unknowns like a startup

212
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,600
you really um need people to be willing

213
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,719
to

214
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:39,440
continuously learn as technology

215
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,760
decision making may evolve a lot

216
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,760
and

217
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:52,080
again you know know what they don't know

218
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:56,000
and help each other out

219
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,760
because you don't want unhappy employees

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,200
who won't communicate when there's a

221
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,040
problem

222
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,800
and in a non-security problem might lead

223
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:11,040
to a security problem eventually

224
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:15,040
if if um if things just kind of

225
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:19,839
go out of control chaotically

226
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,839
and it's so

227
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:28,560
um it's so

228
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:33,839
variable per each scenario

229
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,839
um so

230
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,399
one one needs to adapt for that so

231
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,399
again the importance of commitment to

232
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,040
learning commitment to wanting to teach

233
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,160
each other

234
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,839
and commitment for managers

235
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,439
to be just part of the team

236
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,800
just hearing everybody out and

237
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,480
facilitating collaboration

238
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,640
and there are more you know specific

239
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,200
managerial terms but at the end of the

240
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,319
day

241
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,680
you want to make sure that

242
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
you know all of the agile principles as

243
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,800
far as

244
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,199
delivery to the customer plus internal

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,079
because everything affects the product

246
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,320
everything

247
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,319
affects the the security being a big

248
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,760
part of it

249
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:28,240
also facilitating mentorship internally

250
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:31,680
and externally is very important

251
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,640
um a lot of what these types of

252
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,680
communities

253
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,760
are there for is to get

254
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,959
some you know other people's experiences

255
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,240
and learn from other people's

256
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,279
experiences

257
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,240
and diversity of thought that you can

258
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,880
then

259
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,680
bring to your team and teams and

260
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,320
managers should encourage that

261
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,439
i'm not saying funding conferences per

262
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,320
se because

263
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,399
you s some teams can't afford it again

264
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,320
especially um

265
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,560
very early stage startups

266
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,560
but

267
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,680
you really want to encourage

268
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,680
growth and encourage

269
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,440
them to learn from whoever they can and

270
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
bring that back to the team as opposed

271
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
to just keeping themselves

272
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,839
for themselves and who's to say that you

273
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,839
know that they will go

274
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,440
and optimize learning opportunities that

275
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,360
are offered

276
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,760
but again that that kind of falls under

277
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,560
the category of hiring

278
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
and i had

279
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,040
and really like how to facilitate that

280
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,560
again is so variable you literally just

281
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,760
have to learn

282
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,839
per case you kind of have to do do your

283
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,360
recon and very abstract qualitative

284
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:59,040
open ways and

285
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,680
which which kind of um aided my decision

286
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,880
to

287
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,160
not not use the slide deck that i had

288
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,399
put together for a similar topic

289
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,399
but um

290
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,360
yeah i mean and i think oddly enough i

291
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,440
think

292
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,639
that a very social gathering where there

293
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,680
are games and

294
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,880
that that um d and d resembling game was

295
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,560
quite brilliantly done by the way um i i

296
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,639
just learned it was d because

297
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,719
i i didn't i never played that but i

298
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,680
looked up those character names that i

299
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:40,959
hadn't heard of

300
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,359
but again free-flowing thoughts i'm not

301
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,399
saying that it has to be a virtual bar

302
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,440
crawl per se

303
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,639
but having everybody be friendly

304
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,839
and open as a starting point

305
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,399
is actually measurable

306
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,360
it actually matters it actually matters

307
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,880
again as chloe said

308
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,480
um if a manager won't give you

309
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,920
what you need for your mental health

310
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,240
which will then affect

311
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
everything in terms of the work you do

312
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,240
then

313
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,680
you want to take your talent elsewhere

314
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,160
you want to take your commitment

315
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,800
everywhere

316
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,839
you want to take that combination of you

317
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,920
elsewhere

318
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,360
and their opportunities and then you go

319
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,360
back to

320
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,040
some open community and you meet someone

321
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,040
else and

322
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,079
you know you really do have a choice and

323
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,519
in a way that's a

324
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,560
big big um silver lining as far as

325
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,320
defcon having and all you know um hacker

326
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,880
summer camp and all of this going

327
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,839
virtual is that it eliminates certain

328
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,079
access barriers

329
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,839
um and

330
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,920
i usually suggest that people who have

331
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,519
um specific questions reach out to me by

332
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,040
message

333
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,839
um because again managing anything or

334
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,920
answering any questions in

335
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,320
specific is um

336
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,519
is is always important and i really like

337
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,839
to have

338
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,720
uh one-on-one conversation like i can

339
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,199
put my

340
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,839
twitter handle in the chat actually i

341
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,839
did that for an earlier talk too

342
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,600
and just again continue to learn and

343
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,560
continue to bounce ideas

344
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,160
off of each other in any role i know

345
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,160

everything's kind of free

351
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,839
free flow flowing and

352
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,480
management should not be something scary

353
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,079
it should be

354
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:55,839
something ingrained with the rest of

355
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,839

easier

373

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,199

382
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,520
um managing in such a chaos is

383
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,880
is a big thing and you you should

384
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,879
you should provide yourself in that

385
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,480
because that's what's going to really

386
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,079

393
