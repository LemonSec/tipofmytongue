1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,240
and uh next up i'm going to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,240
try and play a video because the

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,040
brian has brian

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,240
linuxing i'm kind of wondering if he's

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
picked the last name if

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,439
the last name linuxing is real or if

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,160
it's because he's

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,560
something he put there because of uh his

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,880
linux presentation but either way

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,919
i'm gonna try and get his video going

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,759
and share it out

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,680
to everyone i can preempt it if you want

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,360
what was that you all hear me i can

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,040
preempt it if you want

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,600
the reason is very simple i have an

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,399
irish surname and no one can pronounce

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,000
it

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,480
oh it's a funny thing about england

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,320
and ireland they you know don't really

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,800
sort of always gel together

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,000
now you can see my avatar from two

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,239
months ago

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,039
you get to actually see the full monty

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:03,519
now as i look like rip van winkle

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,340
there we are avatar

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,640
rip van winkle

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,400
[Music]

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,439
avatar rip van winkle

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,280
yes so um part of the reason is i've

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,839
given chris

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,439
i obviously do a lot of linux and we're

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,640
going to keep this really brief

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,600
i've condensed the presentation into a

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,640
streaming video because it's easier for

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,759
everyone

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,360
less prone to mistakes and everything

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,280
and uh i am on rather slow internet so

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,039
it never works anyway

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,560
so chris is going to stream it now

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,159
in a moment he's really going to be very

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,159
clever at this and yeah it's going to be

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
seamless and then i'm going to hang

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,119
around for the questions

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:55,840
if there are any perfect it'll

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,840
start streaming in a moment good

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
a very good evening to everyone on the

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,439
west coast of america

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,439
there we are you see so i'm gonna shut

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
up

50
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,200
share screen

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,239
where is my

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:37,839

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,840

well

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,959
so while chris is getting that ready

57
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,159
i'll tell you a fun story about

58

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,759
since the time when bill gates had hair

132
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,520
and richard nixon was in the white house

133
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,720
i started coding when i was a child

134
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,280
did basic and then

135
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,120
in the late 70s started professionally

136
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,039
to do

137
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,080
fortran cobol algol and i think about

138
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,199
14 languages in total

139
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,639

146
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,280
i've worked in finance all the complex

147
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,400
places you'd want to go

148
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,280
all the difficult places all the tricky

149
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,679
bits

150
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,599
when there wasn't google to consult

151
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
there was no stack overflow

152
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,919
and you just had to get on with it and

153
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,120
know your onions

154
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,159
in 2016 i founded linuxing in london

155
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,440
which has turned into the largest

156
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:59,440
free and inclusive linux group in

157
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,960

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
of kids and their parents picking up

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,279
tech and enjoying it

173
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,599
it's something i really enjoy obviously

174
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,680
i'm a freelance it manager

175
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,440
i can organize your it systems if you

176
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,479
pay me but let's crack on with the

177
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,080
presentation i've done operating systems

178
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,760
since i was a youngster 24 plus i forget

179
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,560
exactly the number this is a wide

180
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,600
selection

181
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,640
from big systems to small systems

182
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,000
i've done more windows than i have here

183
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,000
and now i tend to prefer linux because

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
it's comparatively trouble free less

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,640
aggravation

186
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,480
i started doing linux in 93

187
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,519
windows in 84. i can bore you for hours

188
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,920
on windows linux whatever you'd like

189
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,880
i can sort systems out but i really like

190
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,680
doing outreach on linux and teaching

191
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,880
people

192
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:41,040
how easy it is and how productive it is

193
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,640
linux is everywhere now

194
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,000
on your android phone in the world's

195
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,160
biggest supercomputers

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,320
if you have 200 million dollars

197
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,480
and you build a supercomputer linux

198
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
is going to be the only choice of

199
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,519
operating system

200
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:05,040
that you'll pick and why

201
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,360
because it works microsoft run it

202
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,399
facebook run it when you run a film on

203
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,839
netflix

204
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,040
it's running linux but more importantly

205
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,440
with linux you've got

206
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,519
choice you've got variety you're not

207
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,600
just stuck with one operating system

208
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,519
that's a bit cranky that wants you to

209
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,880
work a certain way

210
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,279
distro watch lists 274

211
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,480
live linux distributions as of this

212
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,600
month

213
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,200
so if you want you can play

214
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,079
with many of these different types

215
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,200
they're clustered in family types some

216
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,880
are very similar

217
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
if you learn skills on one particular

218
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,079
version of linux it'll hold you in good

219
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,519
stead on the others

220
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,519
but if you don't particularly like a

221
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
particular

222
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,480
distribution the arrangement of the

223
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,360
icons the graphics don't

224
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,160
support you or support applications that

225
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
you want

226
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,760
you can change you can have variety

227
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,000
again linux has plenty of choice and

228
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,600
it's fast

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,440
this evening's topic we're going to look

230
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,440
at the topic of hardening linux

231
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,600
what obstacles can exist how to preempt

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,079
them then we'll crack on with two

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,200
technical

234
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:22,399
demos let's consider

235
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,360
a dilemma imagine hypothetically you are

236
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,240
charged with

237
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
the security of a very large production

238
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,440
system

239
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,800
it could comprise one machine

240
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,959
it could comprise a hundred

241
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,599
two hundred you don't know

242
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,800
you've been told you've got to secure it

243
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,240
but no one can tell you

244
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,680
how secure it is already

245
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
you've got to be careful when you touch

246
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,839
it

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,279
if you touch it do you break it if you

248
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,920
break it

249
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,439
does that affect production there's lots

250
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,760
and lots of issues

251
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,880
when it comes to production systems in

252
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,480
computing

253
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:09,200
they could be running here

254
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,240
as in this supercomputer of old

255
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,240
nuclear simulations they could be

256
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,519
running

257
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:22,399
websites they could be running

258
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:25,040
revenue for charities

259
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,880
production systems are the key systems

260
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,199
in i.t

261
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,519
they're the ones with the most uptime

262
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:36,399
they're the ones which should be

263
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,399
caressed looked after and secured

264
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:45,839
but it's tricky we've got to consider

265
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,920
how and what type of it systems work

266
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,079
to understand that question in the first

267
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,279
instance

268
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,839
so you've decided you're going to

269
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,399
develop

270
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,040
a production system for the sake of

271
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,440
argument

272
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,800
it's a banking system you have a

273
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,079
development cluster

274
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,680
it comprises 100 nodes you employ dozens

275
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,680
and dozens of programmers

276
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,959
they develop the code they need

277
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,199
compilers they need utilities

278
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,959
they simulate what they can they then

279
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,320
pass it on to a qa

280
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,399
cluster that cluster then

281
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,120
simulates the transactions as they would

282
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,279
find in the production environment

283
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,880
but they're only simulated much stricter

284
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,639
than the development environment

285
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,079
but still not a whole production

286
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,639
environment

287
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,599
you then run to a banking production

288
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,639
system

289
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,680
there's no compilers no no extra

290
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,240
utilities

291
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,319
it's locked down you want nothing extra

292
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,199
on that system that could

293
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
cause a breach help a breach or help

294
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,920
anyone

295
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,560
gain access to it so in practice there's

296
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,959
different

297
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:58,079
levels of accessibility

298
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:03,279
usability in the type of systems

299
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:07,359
that we encounter in computing

300
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,959
so back to where we are

301
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,440
you have to audit all of these machines

302
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,079
how do you do it manually that's what we

303
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,480
used to do

304
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,079
in the 90s and it was a tedious process

305
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,199
we would have a checklist we would have

306
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,680
a mental

307
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,279
picture of how a good system worked and

308
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,279
we would work through that now

309
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,360
weeks and weeks will pass eventually we

310
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,319
will produce a report

311
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,959
it may be completely accurate it might

312
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,079
have missed stuff

313
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,599
humans are very fallible

314
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,920
when you're dealing with hundreds and

315
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,440
hundreds of systems it's very easy to

316
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,680
make a mistake

317
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,800
and so now we want to go towards

318
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,800
automated tools

319
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,040
that's your predicament you're on your

320
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,839
own what do you do

321
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,040
you need to audit a production machine

322
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,040
and by auditing it

323
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,560
you're going to find problems you're

324
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,519
going to then suggest

325
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,599
how those problems can be fixed and over

326
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,920
the passage of time

327
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,880
when they're implemented your linux

328
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,240
system will become

329
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,240
harder and harder to crack

330
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:25,360
but it's very difficult to know

331
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:28,639
where to start you need an ally

332
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,680
and your ally in this case is

333
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,920
linus linus is one

334
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,319
of many many linux security talks

335
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,439
a lot of them are proprietary a lot of

336
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,120
them are closed source

337
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,120
a lot of them are incredibly expensive

338
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,839
they may work they may not work in your

339
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,600
environment they might take

340
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,959
an hour to set up they might take two

341
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,959
days you don't know

342
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:01,279
linus has the benefit of being quick

343
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,279
open source and accessible

344
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
you can get it working very quickly you

345
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,680
can order the system very quickly

346
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,279
you get the feedback you then know what

347
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,920
you can do to harden

348
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,920
that machine

349
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,319
but the question is why do we want to

350
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,480
harden linux

351
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,839
isn't it secure ironically

352
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,120
linux is used by the fbi the

353
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,720
chinese state has mandated it

354
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,680
the nsa major security organizations use

355
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
it

356
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,000
and it is secure by design and by

357
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,639
separation of privilege

358
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,360
users can't in general damage a linux

359
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,199
system

360
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,720
but misconfiguration is

361
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,560
a problem back to where we were

362
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,839
you're a developer you have to get some

363
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,839
code into the production system

364
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,560
you may cut corners you may

365
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,880
be pushed for deadlines you may just

366
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,839
make a mistake you may misconfigure

367
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,520
something that works on the development

368
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,720
machine and then gets pushed over

369
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,400
to the production machine

370
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,280
it's very easy for that to happen

371
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,280
and it has happened

372
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,640
so we want to look out for

373
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,599
misconfiguration

374
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,640
and linus will help us do that we're

375
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:30,240
going to do two technical demonstrations

376
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,200
it's very easy to do and get

377
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,160
linus installed we're going to do it on

378
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,120
a standard

379
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:43,039
ubuntu 2004 system and then on a lovely

380
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,600
jetson xavier nx from nvidia

381
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,559
which is effectively running a

382
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,678
derivative

383
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,678
of ubuntu 1804

384
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,840
the only requirement in this instance to

385
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,679
get going is to have git installed on

386
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,720
the machine

387
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,160
there are other ways of installing it

388
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,760
but this shows how quickly you can do

389
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,280
this

390
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,240
it's very trouble-free it's very easy

391
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,840
and as you'll see there it's four lines

392
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,679
we're going to run it from a standard

393
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,918
linux account not a privileged account

394
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,320
not one with root privilege

395
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,120
and there's a reason for that we want to

396
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,480
run

397
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,600
a very short and accessible report

398
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,720
the root version of it is extremely

399
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,240
thorough

400
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,600
but it does take a bit of time so

401
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,520
if we read down what we're going to do

402
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
we're going to get clone it we're going

403
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,160
to

404
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
drop into the directory then we're going

405
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,240
to check

406
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:49,200
the version we're running typically

407
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,200
it can come installed on a linux system

408
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,679
from the supplier or oem

409
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,200
or in this case canonicals repos

410
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,919
the difficulty is the versions they have

411
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,600
can be

412
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,400
slightly out of date the one we're going

413
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,159
to be using

414
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,240
is the most up-to-date version it has

415
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,559
all the goodies and michael

416
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,320
the author of it assures me that there's

417
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,960
been a year's work

418
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,200
put into it to improve it make it very

419
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,320
user-friendly make it very informative

420
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,520
and that's the one we're going to

421
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:39,840
recommend so now we're going to crack on

422
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:39,840
and do the technical demos

423
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,000
firstly we ssh

424
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,240
to

425
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,240
a small

426
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:07,840
jets and nano

427
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,240
now if we look at the third line we can

428
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,280
see it's running

429
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,559
on the arm architecture

430
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:35,840
and it looks like a plain

431
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:35,840
linux system let's double check it

432
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,840
so we're running 1804.4

433
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:58,320
and you can see we're running it on an

434
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:01,678
arm processor what a wonderful thing

435
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,280
let's grab that and now

436
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,280
we're going to install

437
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,840
takes a few seconds really

438
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,200
we're executing it making sure we

439
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,960
execute it

440
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,640
from that directory we're in

441
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,440
check the version version is okay

442
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,440
version three

443
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,840
and now

444
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,959
we're going to audit the system but what

445
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,480
we're going to do

446
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,480
we could run it interactively

447
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,000
we can run it here interactively or we

448
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,760
can pipe it to a file

449
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,159
that's what i think we should do in this

450
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,280
instance

451
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:14,320
because we can then step through

452
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:27,840
the individual reports and look at them

453
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:27,840
give it a sensible name

454
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,640
now you can see the obvious error

455
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,080
there i should have put the time command

456
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,320
in front of the

457
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,879
dot slash in practice this will take two

458
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,879
minutes to come through

459
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,919
and then we can step through

460
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,720
and look at all the details

461
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:59,520
it gives us a thing to bear in mind

462
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,919
about linus is that it runs on the

463
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,120
biggest of systems

464
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,400
so if you were fortunate to manage

465
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,439
a supercomputer you can

466
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,039
download it install it run it up

467
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,799
it'll work there or if you have a

468
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,240
raspberry pi and you want to check the

469
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,120
configuration

470
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,120
you can do the same

471
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
talking to michael he tells me that

472
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,159
every order

473
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,600
is unique so it will scan your machine

474
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,039
it won't run

475
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,719
a lot of junk it runs across

476
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,360
a plethora of distributions obviously

477
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,280
from

478
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,479
ubuntu debian centos susa

479
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,480
fedora red hat even

480
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,600
freebsd it runs across

481
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,760
all of them and it produces a very

482
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,559
detailed report

483
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,440
which you can then take to management

484
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,480
and this is the key

485
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
this is the key part here when you're

486
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,960
auditing systems

487
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,320
you've got to have evidence to prove

488
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,520
what you think

489
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,240
is wrong you just can't simply say

490
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,039
xyz you know that's probably wrong you

491
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,520
could be right

492
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,559
you need strong evidence you need

493
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,720
authoritative

494
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:21,760
evidence this gives you this so

495
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,480
we do the audit we take it back to

496
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,559
management

497
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,000
we get the buy-in of management we get

498
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,360
the buy-in of the

499
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,679
technical teams there will be resistance

500
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,879
there's no denying that because once

501
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
you've got

502
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,480
this report it's going to tell you

503
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,679
things are wrong

504
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,159
they may be wrong on purpose they may be

505
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,760
done in a particular way because that's

506
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,880
how your application works

507
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,320
there may also be oversights but

508
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,360
remember

509
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,360
everything's not just technology it's

510
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,799
human interactions so when you come back

511
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,600
with a report

512
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,639
you want to convince people that this is

513
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,760
sensible

514
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,240
this is doable and the changes make the

515
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,039
system secure and better for everyone

516
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,279
that's the way to harden your systems

517
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,840
and this is the way

518
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,840
to examine them so we're going to look

519
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,840
at this report here

520
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,600
it tells us non-privileged mode

521
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,600
if we did a sudo before

522
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,879
the execution it would ask for a

523
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,120
password

524
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,000
it would then run and it would scan

525
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,000
everything

526
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,679
and it would be immensely comprehensive

527
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,679
i recommend running the non-privileged

528
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,520
mode initially just to get yourself

529
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,159
a feel for the application when i ran it

530
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,440
on this machine yesterday the

531
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,679
non-privileged

532
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,480
took two minutes the privileged 30

533
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,919
minutes

534
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,000
still very quick and

535
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,000
you can see it gives us information

536
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,679
about the whole of the machine it tells

537
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,679
us the architecture

538
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:06,799
what's actually there what isn't there

539
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,799
and we can

540
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,400
go down ever so slightly you're going to

541
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,918
see it will

542
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,960
tell you if it misses things you can see

543
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,080
there it tells you

544
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,080
there's no audit tools

545
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,840
it tells you you've got i've got

546
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
promiscuous interfaces

547
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,000
if something is a potential problem it

548
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,320
tends to flag it up

549
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,600
in red

550
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,600
or as you saw there

551
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,640
it said week

552
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,158
so you're going to take this report

553
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,559
you're going to sit down

554
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,159
you're going to analyze it you're going

555
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,678
to talk to all the staff

556
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,320
locally and you're going to say these

557
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,320
are issues

558
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,880
which ones can we tidy up how can we

559
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:07,039
make our system

560
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:08,799
better now as we go on

561
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,200
this is where it gets really interesting

562
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,559
go down

563
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,240
look at the suggestions the suggestions

564
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,678
are lovely

565
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,919
the suggestions are informative they

566
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,760
tell us things that we don't know

567
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,760
we could spend a week a day

568
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,159
a couple of fortnights a couple of

569
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,760
months auditing a single machine

570
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,360
and not come up with this information

571
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,720
this is precious this is

572
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,678
just in the standard

573
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,440
non-root mode the root version of this

574
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,080
will give you a cornucopia of

575
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
information

576
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,840
you see absolutely lovely

577
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,960
that's what you want it gives you advice

578
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,679
levels

579
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,720
on ssh how to harden it absolutely

580
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,039
brilliant

581
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,039
so that is on a

582
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:08,720
jetson ubuntu ubuntu installation

583
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,720
of all things

584
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,559
from scratch not been changed around so

585
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,719
you can see that

586
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,320
even on a new system there are ways to

587
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,919
improve things

588
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,200
so what we're going to do now we're

589
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,440
going to quickly go over

590
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,440
to

591
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,399
another ubuntu system

592
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,640
and install it over there and have a

593
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,559
look

594
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:59,840
so we can see there we're running on a

595
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:59,840
an intel 64-bit implementation

596
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,960
the latest wonderful

597
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,440
released version of ubuntu long term

598
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,440
support

599
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,840
there's nothing additional on this

600
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:19,279
particular machine

601
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,279
it's a fairly old desktop as you can see

602
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,200
it's a dual core

603
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,960
64-bit fairly slow fairly usable

604
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:41,120
you see i'd already done it once before

605
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:45,039
so let's go in now

606
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,039
and we're going to get rid of the past

607
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,679
old version it's very simple to get rid

608
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,679
of

609
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,080
i recommend being a bit careful if you

610
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,199
do these commands on your own

611
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,480
but it's beautiful because

612
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,919
if you're on a production machine you

613
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,600
don't need to install much it's a

614
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,480
directory

615
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,678
you can have someone standing over your

616
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,760
shoulder

617
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,640
you can install the software run it and

618
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:23,840
then take off the report then remove it

619
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:23,840
you know the system's then secure

620
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:37,840
again very quick a couple of seconds to

621
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,840
come down

622
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,240
and once it comes down we're going to

623
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:51,840
run it in the interactive mode

624
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,840
it's very simple very easy

625
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,840
version three as we can see

626
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,600
you're stuck here you want to know what

627
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,799
are the options

628
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:21,840
and there are plenty oops a daisy

629
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,760
there we are so you can order a system

630
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,559
all the docker file there's lots and

631
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,440
lots of show commands

632
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:32,000
lots of immense goodies i thoroughly

633
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,600
recommend working your way through them

634
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,519
in the short instance we're going to

635
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,000
just do the

636
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,000
audit

637
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:50,960
now comparing the two systems as we ran

638
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,279
if i ran this in non-interactive mode

639
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,039
and piped it to a file

640
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,720
it would take about a minute

641
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:05,760
the jetson xavier nx

642
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,760
is about half the speed on this

643
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:14,000
now if you're running in aws

644
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,799
or a big cluster

645
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,799
it's going to be

646
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,559
much much faster so we can see it's

647
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,760
working through things it's checking

648
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,600
things as it goes on

649
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,279
warnings what's there what it doesn't

650
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,000
find what it likes what it doesn't like

651
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,519
that's what you want to take away that's

652
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
what you're taking away you're taking

653
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,120
away the condensed information

654
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,880
of how to harden your linux system

655
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,239
you're then going to use that in your

656
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,240
organization to win the management over

657
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,440
you're then going to use it to sell to

658
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,519
the technical

659
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,679
teams that it will make their life

660
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,840
easier

661
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,720
less aggravation systems that tend to be

662
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,760
secure

663
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,440
tend to have less crashes

664
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,799
but it's a struggle there's no denying

665
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,840
that it's a struggle

666
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,279
but you need hard evidence you can't

667
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,678
simply say

668
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,559
the system's insecure you need something

669
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,360
to back you up

670
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,720
and this is the perfect tool for that as

671
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,000
i said it's open source

672
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:20,320
it's free and if we skip back here

673
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,480
ever so slightly we can see

674
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,240
it gives us lots and lots of lovely

675
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,600
suggestions as to how to increase

676
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,600
the security on this system

677
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:43,120
that's how you harden a linux system

678
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,799
you audit them you use tools

679
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,039
you make sure you've got buy-in from

680
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,840
people

681
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,799
and you do the changes very slowly very

682
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,480
methodically

683
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,158
and after a period of time your linux

684
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,279
systems are wonderful

685
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,279
if they're not already

686
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,760
so

687
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:09,440
back to the slides that's where we are

688
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,440
that's how you do it it's very simple

689
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,800
not complicated

690
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,918
collate the reports look for something

691
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,359
serious hopefully you had the my the

692
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,879
management buy-in beforehand but even if

693
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,639
you hadn't

694
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,639
you use the report to do that

695
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,799
you should tell them the insecure

696
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,678
systems

697
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,159
lose money millions and millions of

698
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,960
pounds

699
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,639
are lost by companies when they're

700
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,119
breached

701
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,119
techies will be a bit resistant

702
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,960
there'll be a lot of changes

703
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,359
so you want to do small wins you want to

704
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,679
buy in the senior technical staff

705
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,679
you want to do things very slowly very

706
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,800
methodically

707
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,599
you want to do things

708
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,640
which if implemented and there's a

709
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,720
problem you can roll

710
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,799
back you've got to look out for cultures

711
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,078
don't assume a change is naturally going

712
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,240
to work

713
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,400
after a change has been implemented been

714
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,680
bedded down

715
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,480
ordered again look to tidy up try to get

716
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,759
metrics on

717
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,800
how you're doing and also hardening

718
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,359
of linux is not just technology

719
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,359
it's people

720
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:33,040
and if you suggest changes

721
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,000
they may feel stressed so you've got to

722
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,279
win them over

723
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,160
and say aren't they going to be more

724
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,240
stressed

725
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,839
if the systems they've been working on

726
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,839
are broken into

727
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,078
the tool that you're using

728
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,240
is one of the best in the world it's won

729
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,560
numerous prizes it's open source

730
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,598
you can look at it you can view the

731
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,880
source

732
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,839
code you can work out how it works

733
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,880
you can talk to the author on twitter

734
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,880
he's very accessible

735
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,839
you can grab hold of a system and

736
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,680
improve it

737
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:16,078
and i recommend you do this

738
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,160
these are the lovely links if you want

739
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,839
more nice tools
