1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,319
i'm also looking forward to our next

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
item

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,480
we're gonna be learning about dealing

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,960
with burnout from chloe

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,960
and i don't know about chloe's last name

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,160
she's gonna have to say it for us

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,160
i know it's really hard but if it's miss

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,279
doggy i know it looks like it and you're

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,720
like what

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,560
is that mess doggy yeah yeah

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,000
i always do this game where people try

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,160
to guess where it's from

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,119
so usually the common ones i get is is

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,280
it italian or japanese

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,239
and it's neither that's that's the fun

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
one

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,000
all right let's do this okay you guys

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,279
i'm gonna share my screen if that's

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,520
possible

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,160
chris i have permission i do have

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,520
permission yes

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,519
all right can you all see my screen

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,719
yes okay cool all right so the title is

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,480
active balance but to be honest the

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
reason why it's called active balance is

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,680
because

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,320
one where balance is off between our

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,559
life and our personal life

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,159
then we have a problem and usually

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,720
that's when we start noticing we're

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,080
burned out

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,080
i don't really need to dive into the

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,400
slide but you guys know who i am i

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,280
hope but if not like my name is chloe

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,360
masay

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,600
and uh you might know me from point

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,799
three or we are hackers formerly known

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,479
as women hackers

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,680
or woesec all right so

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,520
this is what i want you to do we're

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
going to do some visioning

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,798
so i want you to imagine you're driving

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,960
in your car

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,640
and while you're driving in your car

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,600
you're going to be merging into another

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,119
lane

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,960
now there's a part of you that doesn't

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,159
want to look in the side

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,280
mirror you're like well if i don't look

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
in the side mirror

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,640
then you know maybe i'll get an accent

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,240
then i don't have to do that assignment

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,439
or maybe i don't need to do that project

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,280
and this is a type of this is when you

55
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,639
have a huge warning sign that you

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,320
are dealing with an extreme burnout

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
another example is when you start

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,119
noticing if you are burned out

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
it used to take you a few minutes to

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,479
send an email but now it's taking you

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,679
like 10 minutes sometimes an hour

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
sometimes days

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,800
and then your inbox is so flooded that

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,239
you just can't do it anymore

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,480
or better yet when you have these

66
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,520
situations where you have friends and

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
family

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,959
and colleagues that are trying to reach

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,560
you but you

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,680
press ignore or you don't text back

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,080
right away

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
and usually it's because you're busy but

73
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,400
there's also a party that feels like

74
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,720
it's another task talking to this person

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
is going to be another task for you

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160
or you feel like they're going to

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,079
request something from you

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,040
and you don't have any more to give at

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,239
this point you just feel kind of trapped

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,160
and feel really really stuck

81
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,760
and then there's emotions that associate

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,799
with burnout where you can feel

83
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,120
very sad too soundly very angry i know

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,680
whenever i look at trump's tweets i

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,480
literally

86
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
want to throw my phone really hard but

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,840
the thing is

88
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,359
is like the sudden emotion of anger and

89
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,280
sadness is something that we're all

90
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,120
dealing with right now especially during

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,040
a pandemic and pandemics bring out this

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,959
they bring out these fears it makes us

93
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,760
feel trapped it makes us feel

94
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
empty to a certain extent we feel like

95
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,560
we

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
have no control in our life and usually

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,480
that feeling

98
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,879
of lacking of control it drains

99
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,399
us it drains our energy and emotional

100
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,399
burnout is real

101
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,239
it's just like regular burnout but it's

102
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,000
more emotions involved versus a work

103
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,519
or sometimes you procrastinate sometimes

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,040
we will like push out dates

105
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
we'll be like oh yeah i need to get that

106
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,200
done well let me see here

107
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,560
at the last days is actually in two days

108
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
okay i don't need to get it done

109
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,959
and so you wait till the very last

110
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,000
minute or sometimes you're like you'll

111
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
extend the time

112
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,798
but usually the the one sign that we all

113
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,439
know is that

114
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,280
it's very strange we just no matter how

115
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,400
much sleep we get we just feel so

116
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,599
exhausted we feel

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
so tired and this is the most common

118
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,480
trait

119
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,560
of burnout now i want to just let you

120
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,599
know that sometimes it might be good to

121
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,439
get your

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,079
vitals checked for example i felt really

123
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,238
low

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,280
in energy and i'm like this doesn't feel

125
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,358
like me usually

126
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,320
so i want to go and get blood check for

127
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,560
iron

128
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,120
um because i'm a vegan it sucks

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,360
sometimes because you have low iron

130
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
um or you sometimes you'll have vitamin

131
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
b deficiencies

132
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,160
so i got checked and my iron levels were

133
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,280
a little bit low started taking iron

134
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,560
felt much better

135
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,599
so i really recommend that on top of

136
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,240
taking

137
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
precautions and taking care of yourself

138
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,320
with burnout also get checked out

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
by your doctor to make sure that your

140
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,560
vitamins are all okay

141
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,880
and that your body is healthy

142
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,840
so overall burn out what it is like it's

143
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,800
like as if

144
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,239
you are a device yourself and you are at

145
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
five percent or less

146
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,960
of a battery charge meaning you're not

147
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
able to function fully you don't feel

148
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,159
fully

149
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,359
functional you just feel kind of stuck

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
in one place

151
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,240
and you just can't keep giving

152
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,919
and i just want to let you guys know i'm

153
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,320
not a therapist at all

154
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,719
but i have worked with therapists to try

155
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
to help others deal with burnout because

156
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
in the infosec community especially the

157
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,080
hacker community

158
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,520
so many of us are actually really burned

159
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,719
out and it's because

160
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,000
we're an industry that works 24 7.

161
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,759
that's when industries have that so we

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
don't know when we're on call we're

163
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,560
constantly having to feel like we're on

164
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,160
the edge

165
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,320
so keep that in mind but with the

166
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,919
pandemic things have escalated

167
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,320
a lot because we're dealing with a lot

168
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,198
of emotions right now

169
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,080
especially in the us when we're turning

170
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,199

172
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,000
guys to know that you're not alone

173
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,639
during this i

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,639
don't feel like

175
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:07,840
now the next thing is

176
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,560
thank you okay so what is burnout so out

177
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,720
to save emotional

178
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,960
physical mental exhaustion caused by

179
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,400
excessive and prolonged stress it occurs

180
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,719
when you feel overwhelmed emotionally

181
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,719
drained and unable to meet

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,919
constant demands now to know about

183
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,319
stress is

184
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,520
digesting stress and burnout is that

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,000
with stress you're like

186
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,400
okay if i have this glass of red wine or

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,960
i have a bubble bath or if i go for a

188
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
walk

189
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
i'm going to feel a little bit better

190
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,919
with burnout you could do

191
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,560
all those things collectively and still

192
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,639
not feel

193
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,400
better that's the difference between

194
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,000
burnout burnout is when you have

195
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,159
an over you've overreached your capacity

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,080
stress is like you know sometimes

197
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,560
there's a healthy stress involved

198
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
where you just are on your toes but just

199
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
note that there's two very different

200
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,800
things

201
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,639
now there's a quiz link right there that

202
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
you can check out

203
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
the burnout index is a really helpful

204
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,080
quiz if you need to find out if you are

205
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
burned out or not

206
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,840
but i just want to let you guys know

207
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,039
that if you enjoy your job and the work

208
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
that you do

209
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,400
that quiz is not going to probably be as

210
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,159
applicable to you

211
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,919
it's a good quiz to see whether or not

212
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,919
you are happy with your job

213
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,280
and if you are dealing with burnout or

214
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,758
if you don't like your job and you're

215
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,758
dealing with burnout

216
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,080
now usually when we say how to prevent

217
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,960
burnout exercise eat balance diet

218
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,039
practice good sleep habits ask for help

219
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,198
that's wonderful except that we can't

220
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,479
really go out and about that much and i

221
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,400
don't know if anyone has tried running

222
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,919
with a mask on it's really hard but you

223
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,679
have to do it

224
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,198
um eating a balanced diet can be

225
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,720
challenging too when your emotions are

226
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,120
all over the place

227
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,120
we tend to either binge eat or we just

228
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,800
we're so overly anxious we can't even

229
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,360
think of eating we skip meals because

230
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,639
we're not even thinking about it

231
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,639
also dealing with good sleep habits

232
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,080
how do we do that if we're constantly

233
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,919
stressed

234
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,000
stressed out about our daily life or we

235
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,039
have to do things that just keep going

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,080
over and over and above our head

237
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,280
and asking for help is great too but i

238
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,919
want to talk it too

239
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,599
a little bit further these are just

240
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,840
little simple things that you can do

241
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,960
but in reality it's not good enough

242
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,318
especially during this time

243
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,718
so the first thing you need to do is

244
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,000
have self-awareness you need to check in

245
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,440
with yourself

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,240
if you're feeling like you're taking

247
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,599
more than usual to complete a task or

248
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,159
project or an email maybe think about

249
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,360
maybe taking a break the other thing to

250
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,519
do is like if you

251
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,720
sleep and you just don't feel so tired

252
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,040
still

253
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
maybe that's another one sometimes

254
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,640
self-awareness comes when we certainly

255
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,320
see ourselves drinking a little bit more

256
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,360
than our usual

257
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,600
that's one way but or also if we are

258
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,519
drinking more caffeine than usual

259
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
so having that self-awareness of like

260
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,800
where you're standing how your energy

261
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,000
levels are if you're feeling like the

262
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,479
sense of like i just

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,839
don't know what's going on with me it's

264
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,560
really important to keep yourself in

265
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,839
check

266
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,839
and the best way how do i do that

267
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,720
believe it or not is uh through

268
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,880
journaling

269
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,480
so you can journal every day or you can

270
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,839
journal you know

271
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,000
once a week whatever you can do

272
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,880
i really really recommend that because

273
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,360
you'll see

274
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,920
certain trends in your writing where

275
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,320
you'll

276
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,920
say the exact same situation over and

277
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,480
over and over and you want to keep an

278
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,160
eye on that in case if you need to get

279
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
some assistance on that

280
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,199
or for you to have a better

281
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,720
understanding of what's really happening

282
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,240
deep down inside because

283
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,000
we're so overwhelmed with so many things

284
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,760
happening all the time

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,680
and we have constant distractions all

286
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,720
the time that we don't really know how

287
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,040
to check in with ourselves

288
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
so journaling is really good some people

289
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,640
they meditate

290
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,480
um to do it um so just keep that in mind

291
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,720
now a lot of you guys know that i will

292
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
take breaks where you won't hear from me

293
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,079
for like

294
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,839
a day or two and the reason for that is

295
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,279
because i do device breaks

296
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,440
or i call a tech detox i'm not saying

297
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,439
throw your phones out the window or

298
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
throw it on the ground like this

299
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
and by the way this is amazing music

300
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,440
video but

301
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,800
the thing is to know about this part is

302
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
that yes there's going to be moments

303
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,760
where you want to throw your phone

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
because you just can't take it anymore

305
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,839
you're frustrated

306
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,640
but just please take a break what i mean

307
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,079
by that is

308
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,959
once a week take a break that means

309
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,279
no infosec once a week that means one

310
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,560
whole day dedicated to no infosec and

311
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,920
there's a reason for that

312
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,239
because infosec is 24 7. twitter's 24 7.

313
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,279
most of your social media is 24 7 emails

314
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
are 24 7.

315
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,279
you never get a break and we also need

316
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,440
to have a life outside of

317
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,200
infosec because when we're not having a

318
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,040
life outside of infosec

319
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
our balance is going to be off and we're

320
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,000
going to feel overworked we're going to

321
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,720
feel overwhelmed because we're in the

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
same

323
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,800
area all the time so it's really

324
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,680
important to take a break

325
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,199
and turning off your devices getting off

326
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,279
of social media and everything

327
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,640
once a week is really important you do

328
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,680
for a few hours

329
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,000
to six to eight hours or for a day

330
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,359
um depending how bad your burnout is or

331
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,040
the feelings you're starting to have i

332
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,720
highly recommend doing

333
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,599
one day per week if you can if not do

334
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,600
you know

335
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,120
a chunk of time but let your loved ones

336
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,720
know that you are going to be turning

337
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,680
your phone off and devices off and

338
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,800
you'll be unreachable during that time

339
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,760
i really recommend this for you to

340
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,120
be okay with yourself during this time

341
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,000
now if you're starting to feel like

342
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,680
you're really overly

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
exhausted and everything like that and

344
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,519
you know you have burnout

345
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
you need to take more than one day off

346
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,320
so you need to tell

347
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,680
your manager unfortunately that you need

348
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,720
to take some time off but we'll dive

349
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,760
into that in a bit later

350
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,959
write it down i cannot say this enough i

351
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,519
know a lot of people are like

352
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,719
but chloe i don't like to do lists they

353
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,560
scare me because i see

354
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,079
all the things i need to do that's

355
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,680
exactly the problem right

356
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,120
that lets you know really how much

357
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
you've taken on

358
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,200
but it's okay because when you cross it

359
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,440
out it feels amazing

360
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,760
and i do i have a you know i have my

361
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,200
to-do list i take it everywhere i go

362
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
well in the house because i'm not going

363
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
outside but i take it everywhere that

364
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,800
you go

365
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,800
in your home so if something pops in

366
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,240
you're like oh i have to do this or that

367
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,839
that you can free the room and your

368
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,279
brain for other things

369
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,360
this is really good if you're dealing

370
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,079
with insomnia or having problems falling

371
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
asleep

372
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,599
or having problems keeping asleep during

373
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
the night

374
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,760
have your to-do list by your bed and

375
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,720
then make notes of anything that comes

376
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,639
to your mind because usually what

377
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,360
happens is when we lay on our pillow and

378
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,480
we're like

379
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,519
oh i need to send that email at oh

380
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,800
i forgot i forgot to call that person

381
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,959
and you're gonna think about it the

382
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,319
thing is put on a piece of paper and

383
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,119
then forget about it

384
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,519
and look at it later and if you want the

385
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,200
a good way how to refresh your memory is

386
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
in the morning when you're ready to look

387
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,880
at your to-do list

388
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,480
and um think of what are things you need

389
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,079
to prioritize and which ones you don't

390
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,440
you can either highlight them or you can

391
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,120
do it in a different color

392
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,639
but whatever works best for you but i

393
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,079
recommend doing it for like

394
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,480
for your work and personal and you can

395
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,719
have it on the same page if you want

396
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,000
now this is the part where it's going to

397
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
be tricky

398
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,959
because a lot of times when people are

399
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
burned out it's because they're unhappy

400
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,680
at their work

401
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,040
or they're unhappy of the things going

402
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,199
on around them

403
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,480
and so it's a time to reevaluate your

404
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,880
life

405
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,959
and so i just want to let you know for

406
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,800
all the people that are underrepresented

407
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,479
in their office or in their jobs or

408
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,479
whatnot

409
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,880
you're going to be more burned out and

410
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,320
burned out a lot faster than most folks

411
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,839
and the reason for that is that

412
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,880
underrepresented people they usually

413
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,000
take on 2.5 times more of the work

414
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,560
than the people that are usually

415
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,639
represented in the space or on the team

416
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,319
you're going to be taking on more roles

417
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
and this is actually something that's

418
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
common across

419
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,040
everyone is that sometimes some of us

420
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,560
are taking on multiple

421
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,560
jobs or multiple hats multiple roles

422
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,279
different things tasks that were never

423
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,399
part of your job but you have to put on

424
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,399
and that's something that's going to

425
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
burn you out so fast

426
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,920
so it's really important to have these

427
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,600
one-on-ones with your manager

428
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,399
if you're a manager yourself set up a

429
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,720
101 that's like 15 minutes to 30 minutes

430
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,959
per week with each of your employees

431
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,560
it is so important that you do that

432
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,000
because then you guys can go over the

433
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,479
list of items that need to be done

434
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and help prioritize it but also if

435
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,680
you're a manager and you've noticed that

436
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,959
the performance level has changed

437
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,959
the emails are not as fast or response

438
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,359
or they're they're late or whatnot on

439
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,719
the assignments please keep in mind

440
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,360
that that person might be dealing with

441
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,680
burnout it's also really good

442
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,600
if you are an employer to push for your

443
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,399
company to have a mental health day

444
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,079
so basically having one day a month that

445
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,480
your employees can do whatever they want

446
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,199
if it is to spend for personal time they

447
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,760
can do so

448
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,439
or to work and invest on their own self

449
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,399
and their education or whatever makes

450
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,480
them happy

451
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,320
but to have that one day once a month

452
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,120
for them to unplug and i recommend

453
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,320
a friday or a monday so then they can

454
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,480
have a three-day weekend

455
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,240
it really does show a great employee

456
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,920
appreciation and it shows that you're

457
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,279
investing in their mental health during

458
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,760
this time

459
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,760
now if you don't have a manager that

460
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,519
you're able to have these conversations

461
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,920
and you really need to take time off

462
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,360
and you feel guilty if you take time off

463
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,199
i'm sorry to tell you this

464
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,279
but you're gonna you have to take time

465
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,880
off because if you don't take time off

466
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,040
you're gonna make things worse for your

467
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,959
team you're gonna

468
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,599
fall behind in your work you're not

469
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,359
gonna be good on your a game

470
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,360
when you are burned out so it's really

471
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,680
really important for you to take a break

472
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
and take a step back and what i mean by

473
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,319
break take a few days

474
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,079
off and tell your employer and you take

475
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,000
a few days off they should

476
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,120
be respectful of that and if they have a

477
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,720
problem with that

478
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
i think it's time for you to look

479
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
elsewhere because

480
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,480
every company should invest in their

481
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,199
people especially their security team

482
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,000
because without a good security team

483
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,479
or a security team that feels like the

484
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,959
company is invested in them

485
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
it's so important because if you have

486
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,239
people that are burned out on your

487
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,719
security team you're more likely to deal

488
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,440
with

489
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,279
situations of burnout and that is going

490
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,399
to be really really bad for you because

491
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,240
without a good security team guess what

492
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,160
not investing in your security or your

493
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,199
security team you won't have a product

494
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,719
and you might lose

495
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,279
your company because you've lost your

496
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
customers trust so it's really important

497
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,480
is to push forward for yourself for

498
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,040
mental health

499
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,360
so main takeaways when you're feeling

500
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,399
overwhelmed do a device detox once again

501
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,880
you won't want to do

502
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,480
this for a few hours you you know a

503
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,839
whole day or even more

504
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,839
of a couple days so if you're feeling

505
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,680
really burned out and even if you take

506
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,560
one day off and it wasn't enough

507
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,479
take three sometimes it might be good

508
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,119
just to take a week

509
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,880
or two weeks depending how bad it is

510
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,000
when you feel overwhelmed invest in

511
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,640
yourself i do mean

512
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,640
this if you don't invest in yourself who

513
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,319
else is going to invest in you

514
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,760
so think of that when you feel

515
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,799
overwhelmed ask for help it's so

516
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,879
important to have

517
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,639
a good relationship with your manager or

518
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,640
your office or your team

519
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,720
or your family or your friends if you

520
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
need help you need to go to them

521
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,240
and also there's incredible

522
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,520
organizations in infosec that have your

523
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,760
back if you need help

524
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,720
in anything when you feel overwhelmed

525
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,520
write it down i cannot i cannot push

526
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
this enough

527
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,639
it's so important to have a to-do list

528
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,160
it will help you

529
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,400
when it comes to coordinating anything

530
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,679
and prioritizing and we all know about

531
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,679
prioritizing risk

532
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,080
right so write it down also journal it

533
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,799
last but not least take a break like i

534
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,678
said you need to take a break

535
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,520
every week right now take a few hours

536
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,559
off to a whole day

537
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,280
as with your device detox but also

538
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,440
enforce

539
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,200
your work hours so at times where you

540
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,640
feel like you have like

541
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,520
no like your work hours are terrible and

542
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,000
like so bad i want you to keep that in

543
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,120
mind

544
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,240
okay that's like

545
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,239
let's see here if you're working push

546
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,320
for certain hours on your calendar

547
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,679
and then if anyone goes beyond that

548
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,159
remind them

549
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,000
that these are your set hours and if

550
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,400
it's in a case an emergency or urgent

551
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,120
thing

552
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
or they need something from you to let

553
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,159
you know in

554
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,959
advance and every company should respect

555
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,200
that

556
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,520
you need to do that emails keep a paper

557
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,559
keep a paper trail it will protect you

558
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
legally

559
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,678
to make sure that you are being

560
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,840
protected yourself

561
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,200
and yes sometimes hr is not going to be

562
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,120
there for you so i really recommend

563
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,440
having a relationship with your manager

564
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,559
or someone else in the company that is

565
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,320
an executive

566
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,039
to be able to push forward for these

567
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,559
things and put yourself first because no

568
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,559
one else is going to

569
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,039
you cannot take care of another person

570
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,799
or a company or a team or anything

571
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,160
if you're not taking care of yourself

572
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,160
because if you're burned out

573
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,520
you are going to be failing other people

574
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,600
around you

575
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,440
when you feel overwhelmed no you're not

576
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,678
alone i want you guys to know that

577
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,440
you should never feel alone right now we

578
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,799
have a wonderful infosec community that

579
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,880
has your back

580
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,879
and there's so many great organizations

581
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,000
that are here for you and people

582
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,559
inside infosec that can actually mentor

583
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,520
you

584
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,559
that can also talk to you and recommend

585
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,200
resources for you

586
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,678
but most importantly always ask this

587
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,000
question

588
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,520
am i balancing my work and personal life

589
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,360
and if you're not

590
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,960
you need to take steps to fix it because

591
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,918
that means you're heading into burnout

592
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,000
or you already

593
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,520

this hat

610
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,280
yeah that doesn't look like one you'll

611
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,719
bring to vegas next year

612
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,879
oh well this was the one who was

613
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,799
supposed to go to vegas with me

614
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,280
um yeah oh well it's pretty hot there

615
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,960
it is it is but sometimes those casinos

616
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,760
are really cold so always have a jacket

617
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,120
with me

618
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,640
and then when i step outside i'm like

619
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,719
i'm gonna catch a cold going in like

620
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,760
this really hot dry to like really

621
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,880
really cold weather

622
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,720
but yeah um

623
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,640
but if anyone has any questions i'm here

624
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,559
anyone at this time but if you feel

625
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,520
uncomfortable it's okay you can always

626
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,678
dm me too

627
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,799
i understand mental health is a hard one

628
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,799
to talk about publicly

629
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,120
i i'm really glad you're able to build a

630
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,799
mental health talk into our schedule

631
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,600
just because it's so important to

632
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,600
everyone and

633
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,199
it's something that doesn't get talked

634
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,960
about enough

635
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,280
and probably provided some people some

636
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,919
inspiration on how they can

637
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,158
move forward in a positive direction

638
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,600
yeah i mean i've dealt with burnout on

639
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,159
and off

640
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,158
since i've entered infosec so it'll come

641
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,480
in waves and i'll be like okay that's it

642
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,760
i'm

643
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,720
taking a break for like three days

644
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,919
um but yeah it's really hard sometimes

645
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,400
especially right now

646
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,520
you're kind of feeling stuck at home and

647
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,960
you're like when is

648
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,360

dave each day by

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,200
its own and that's the hardest part for

653
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,880
humans we like to feel controlled

654
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:15,360
like we're in control somehow but yeah
