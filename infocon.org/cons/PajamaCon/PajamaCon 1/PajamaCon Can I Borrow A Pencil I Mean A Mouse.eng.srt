okay sarah mann is next

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,040
and she is going to be presenting

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:17,840
uh can i borrow a pencil i mean a mouse

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,880
which is basically a

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,720
well there's the details we'll let sarah

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,400
get up chris uh basically

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,598
rant slash therapy session um

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
so i'm sarah mann um i'm gonna be

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,480
talking about

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
you know access and equity that's going

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,078
on right now um in

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,920
the inner city school district i work in

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,840
especially considering that they are

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
planning on opening schools

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,520
uh in the fall even in the midst of

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,959
kobed so

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,000
first of all uh a little bit about me

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,239
is um that's my dad jeff mann you might

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440
recognize his twitter handle as at mr

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,559
jeff mann

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,959
um i am in my eighth year

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,599
of teaching overall i taught four years

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,479
of math in

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
pg county maryland and i'll be entering

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,520
my fourth year teaching

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,400
math and science in west philadelphia um

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
and i have earned my master's in

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,880
education and curriculum

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,479
uh and instructional technology

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,000
and forgive me i'm used to talking to 10

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,960
year olds not adults

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,159
so if i have some slip ups you'll have

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,679
to forgive me

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,560
um and i'm also very excited about the

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
opportunity to

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,240
share a little bit about my life as a

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,640
teacher but i think now that zoe said it

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,839
i'm going to call myself a chaos manager

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,240
because that's more of a fitting title

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,479
um

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,000
so i'm just going to go over these few

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,280
questions that have been rolling around

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,360
in my head and

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
probably every other teacher's head with

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,799
all of this uh

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,199
activity that's been going on um namely

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,000
why are schools even considering going

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
back

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
and what kind of supplies and materials

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,280
are we going to be

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,119
needing especially since most supplies

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
and materials come from

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,318
the teachers and the parents not from

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,599
the district

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,238
so um why even think about going back to

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,359
school

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,959
the short answer is the digital divide

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,800
and if you're not aware what the digital

59
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,000
divide is it is basically

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,800
the digital halves versus have nots so

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,480
according to the 2018 survey that the

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,520
school district put out about

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,319
45 percent of students between

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
third and fifth grade have access to

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,679
internet at home

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,840
through a computer 45 so

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,200
this inequity in access to wi-fi

68
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,319
or you know even a hard cable in

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,319
to internet is a significant barrier

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,359
for students to be able to continue

71
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,359
their learning from home

72
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,040
the only reason i'm able to uh is

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,560
because the laptop

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,480
that i'm currently talking to you on was

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,879
provided to me by the district

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,399
and i make enough teacher money to pay

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,679
for my own internet

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,760
so um while 45

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,040
of students are unable to connect at

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,359
home

81
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,679
70 percent of teachers in the district

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,720
according to the same survey

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,959
view that technology access is

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,560
not an issue when at school

85
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,319
and it's not a barrier to student

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,640
learning in the building

87
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,679
so basically if the students are at

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,399
school

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,640
like my beautiful babies here um they

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,200
have far more access to

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,720
the available materials that they need

92
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,440
to be successful

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,799
um by the provision of either the

94
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,079
district the teachers

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,680
and in a few small cases the parents

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,959
so basically teachers and schools

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,760
act as that bridge in the digital divide

98
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,120
so it's not a you know concept a problem

99
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,159
of

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
poor and rich it's you know they have

101
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,879
money for

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,560
supplies versus they don't have money

103
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,319
for supplies it's

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,200
they don't have access money to buy

105
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,560
wi-fi routers connect to a monthly

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,359
subscription

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,639
travel to a library that has a hot spot

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,720
some of these kids

109
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,079
you know they don't have cars the buses

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
stop running

111
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,759
um so school is being thought of

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,440
as this really really important bridge

113
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,560
to even getting kids

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,520
on a computer on online so

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,360
moving into the future the question is

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,039
will students be in school

117
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,919
or will they be distance learning at

118
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,040
home and the short answer is yes

119
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,799
both so as far as i understand

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,479
based on the recent documents that have

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,400
come out in the district

122
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,840
we are going to be moving to a hybrid

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,400
learning model where

124
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,679
students are in front of the teacher for

125
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,599
two days a week

126
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
and distance learning at home for three

127
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,919
days a week and in some extreme cases

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,600
for the very littles students with

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,919
severe disabilities um

130
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,199
physical or learning are going to be in

131
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,359
face to face for

132
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,400
uh all day all week full-time

133
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,840
face-to-face so

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,840
this has so many questions implications

135
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,280
concerns that have been coming up

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,198
because how are we going to

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,638
continue learning face-to-face while

138
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,080
we're mitigating a

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,240
potentially deadly virus so

140
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:33,919
all of that is one side of the concern

141
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,919
the other side of the concern is

142
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,679
what materials what supplies are we

143
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,120
going to need

144
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,840
and what supplies are going to be

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,639
provided so

146
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,320
uh thinking about in-person learning in

147
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,759
the upcoming year it's the same

148
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,599
as the previous years only probably

149
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,240
double or triple the amount that we'll

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
need

151
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,880
so thinking about in person learning

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,400
there's a need for every student to have

153
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,159
a personal supply of

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,440
basic supplies so instead of a class set

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,919
of 20 white boards and 20 scissors

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
and a pencil cup that you know you pass

157
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,159
out and then collect at the end of the

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,679
day

159
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,039
i'm going to need personally about 60

160
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,960
individual sets of pencil pouches

161
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,520
pencils scissors glue sticks colored

162
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,120
pencils personal pencil sharpeners

163
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,440
because they can't be sharing

164
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,960
erasers tissue pouches because they

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,319
can't be getting up walking around

166
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,159
walking to the tissue box they need

167
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,440
their own in their pocket

168
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,479
hand sanitizers all of the things so and

169
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,160
that's just

170
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,400
basic supplies in the classroom the

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,680
other main concern is for the distance

172
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,440
learning portion

173
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,440
uh laptops were distributed to the

174
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,759
students about

175
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,120
a few million dollars was allocated to

176
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,199
buy enough

177
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
chromebooks for all of the students in

178
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,680
the district

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,199
um but after they have a laptop

180
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
do they have wi-fi do they have

181
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,479
headphones do they have

182
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,120
a place to sit and do their work some

183
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,560
families of eight share a one bedroom

184
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,680
one bathroom apartment

185
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,280
and there is no place to go to

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,440
listen to the teacher uh give a talk so

187
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,719
while they're dealing with that even i

188
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,240
here in my house

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,720
am wishing i had an ipad

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,360
because i had to write on my notebook

191
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,400
paper

192
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,960
in front of my screen on how to

193
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,120
convert metric units of distance and

194
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,799
capacity and all of that so

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,560
the difference in materials what we need

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,479
at school and what we did at home

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,520
is growing um

198
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:45,520
so will the district provide

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,639
these supplies for us probably not

200
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,919
since in the past most of the supplies

201
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,120
that teachers use they buy themselves

202
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,159
so this is kind of a common knowledge

203
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,759
teacher thing here we have a

204
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,039
government-funded classroom versus a

205
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,400
teacher-funding classroom

206
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,039
if you go into a classroom and you see

207
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,400
anything that's in color

208
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,039
a teacher bought it so in my uh

209
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,719
teaching history i've had to i have

210
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,240
fundraised

211
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,199
and some of that fundraising money has

212
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
gone to uh colored printer ink so that i

213
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,360
could make

214
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,000
signs and color-coded worksheets and

215
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,360
help

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,960
so uh there's two figures on here

217
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,479
that i wanted to point out the first is

218
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,638
that the average classroom budget

219
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,640
provided to teachers by the district

220
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,039
is 212. in my case it's 100

221
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,000
and then the other figure is that on

222
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,120
average

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,799
teachers spend 740 a year out of pocket

224
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
on classroom supplies

225
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,000
and i'm not sure if this is just

226
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,839
school-based supplies

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,360
or all of the other supplies that

228
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,519
teachers provide

229
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,800
for example snacks water bottles

230
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,800
backpacks uniform shirts

231
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,920
buses field trip money all of those

232
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,519
things

233
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,079
so since most of the stuff is provided

234
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,080
uh by us i want to give you my personal

235
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,080
example of living in philadelphia so

236
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,760
my first year teaching in philly was

237
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,120
2017 to 18 years

238
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,519
and this is what i walked into so

239
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,720
i had all of my materials that i brought

240
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,680
with me from maryland

241
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
most of which were provided by donations

242
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,920
from teachers who were retiring

243
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,640
because a paper basket works just as

244
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,560
well

245
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,080
um year after year that's what the

246
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,959
yellow green and red thing in the back

247
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,680
is

248
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,359
um but this was my 100 allotment i think

249
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,640
that this year i bought

250
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,080
contact paper masking tape

251
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,920
um a box of

252
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
tape like actual like sticky tape to put

253
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,439
all my stuff on

254
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,040
and i did buy some shower curtains to

255
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
hang in the computer closet

256
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,360
so the only thing in this room that was

257
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,480
provided by the actual district was

258
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,040
my teacher laptop one student laptop

259
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,600
per student so i have a cart of about 30

260
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
desks

261
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
chairs a smart board and a box of copy

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,640
paper

263
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,640
so basically in the district give you

264
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,279
100 a box of copy paper and a

265
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,480
thumbs up for good luck um so after my

266
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,040
first year here

267
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,760
recognizing that this room needed a lot

268
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,079
of work

269
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,040
this doesn't represent a space that i

270
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,120
would want to live in

271
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,560
and as zoe was saying the manager's

272
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
responsibility is to make sure everyone

273
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,518
that's working in that space feels

274
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,279
comfortable

275
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,240
so if that's my role i decided i needed

276
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,600
to fundraise

277
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,320
i could spend and i have spent 500 700

278
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,279
800

279
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,519
of my own money but i started thinking

280
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,279
there's got to be people that

281
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,040
want to help in this situation that

282
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,839
aren't aware of it or don't have

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,319
a way of helping so over the last two

284
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,600
years

285
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,160
i have gofundme fundraised and i've

286
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
raised

287
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,240
around fifteen hundred dollars for my

288
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,000
classroom so this is what it looks like

289
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,480
now

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,600
um aside from again the desk and chairs

291
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,040
which were

292
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,320
thankfully upgraded by the district um

293
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,279
i have been able to paint the terrible

294
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,640
dark

295
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,040
prison blue off of my walls

296
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,480
i've been able to get laminating pouches

297
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,120
and colored paper

298
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,000
and pencil caddies all of the supplies

299
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,480
tons of pencils a classroom library

300
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
which

301
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,839
i have students go you teach math why do

302
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,200
you have books i said well

303
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,680
mathematicians know how to read too

304
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,519
science materials you know dirt

305
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,279
measuring cups

306
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,680
graduated cylinders all of those things

307
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,040
folders lanyards for hall passes the

308
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,640
school district requires that we have

309
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,000
hall passes but they don't tell us

310
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,399
how to make them so we have to come up

311
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
with them ourselves i chose lanyards

312
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:49,279
um but anyways i could talk about

313
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,399
what i don't have for ages so i'll focus

314
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,600
on the positive

315
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,320
um this was able to happen because

316
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,920
of the generous donations of everybody

317
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,120
i've spoken to over the last couple of

318
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,880
years saying

319
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,480
you know don't you think somebody should

320
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,880
just be able to get a pencil

321
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,880
if they need a pencil so uh

322
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,479
in addition to all of this this year

323
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,079
moving into covid

324
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,560
uh 19 times these deaths won't work like

325
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,000
this

326
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,399
i could probably only fit two or three

327
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,399
kids at these desks um

328
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,959
they have to be sanitized clorox wipes

329
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:28,320
tissues hand sanitizer all those things

330
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,760
so um here's what happened in the uh

331
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,600
distance learning that i had so my

332
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,959
classroom went from like

333
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,680
25 kids per session to about six per

334
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,880
session

335
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,000
that's that 45 um

336
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,680
and i just thought that this meme

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,880
matched my classroom perfectly so i went

338
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,120
with it

339
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,639
um but basically the school district

340
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
itself is figuring out chromebook

341
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,360
distribution

342
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:55,360
and wi-fi hotspots and

343
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,360
safety protocols and guidelines and

344
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,480
while they're doing all that i'm left

345
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,720
thinking okay

346
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:06,079
how do i put all of that on top of

347
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,880
making sure that i maintain an equitable

348
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,040
and accessible learning environment for

349
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,720
10 year olds in west philadelphia

350
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:18,560
who may not have access to

351
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,720
wi-fi chromebook clean clothes

352
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,800
pencils notebooks all of that stuff so

353
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,959
with the main concern now being safety

354
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,240
and sanitation

355
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,839
the question that um keeps popping up in

356
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,839
my head is

357
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,600
if the district hasn't previously

358
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,079
supplied everything i need to run a

359
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,079
classroom

360
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,240
what's going to change now how are they

361
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,320
going to provide it now

362
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,240
what is going to be the catalyst that

363
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,920
makes them go oh in addition to these

364
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,639
hand sanitizers maybe we need to throw

365
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,319
them some

366
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,480
expo markers so if they do provide a

367
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,519
wall of it the next question is

368
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,920
is that going to be enough so

369
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,519
either way if i'm going to be in the

370
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,319
classroom i'm not going to be taking any

371
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,760
chances

372
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,440
so my students deserve a clean

373
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,120
safe learning environment with

374
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,160
everything that they need at their

375
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,639
fingertips in order to be successful so

376
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,880
i'm buying it i am buying the clorox

377
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,480
wipes i'm hoarding the hand sanitizer

378
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,920
i scooped it all in my classroom last

379
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,199
year before i left

380
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,719
um and of course all the other random

381
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,000
bunch of stuff that students need

382
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,839
throughout the day

383
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,320
they go through a lot of granola bars um

384
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,880
anyways so

385
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,720
um this is why i fundraise this is why i

386
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
reach out to communities that have a

387
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,600
strong belief in

388
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
educating the next generation those kids

389
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,839
that

390
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,440
are gonna enjoy math enjoy technology

391
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,079
want to get their hands in something in

392
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,519
science

393
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,560
and um this is also where you

394
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,600
can be a big help i know that the one of

395
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,239
the reasons my

396
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,199
gofundmes have been so successful in the

397
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,760
past is because of this community which

398
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
is why

399
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,000
i was invited to speak here um chris

400
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,040
tweeted out my response

401
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,560
my gofundme and about 30 minutes later

402
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,519
a very generous donor donated 350

403
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,719
capped off my whole gofundme and i was

404
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,240
set for the school year

405
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,519
so um that's my

406
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,120
uh story that's my mindset going into

407
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,160

408
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480

i have three other wish lists from three

417

other teachers in my school building

418
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,639
because if they're not giving it to me

419
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,880
they're not giving it to them either

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,160

425
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:09,839
uh checking them out and then

426
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:09,839

429
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,399
sarah thanks for having me i really

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,959
appreciate the opportunity

431
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,600
i i think that it's kind of eye-opening

432
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,199
you know here in british columbia canada

433
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,000
i think the schools are a little better

434
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,800
funded not amazing or world-class

435
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,120
but better i think as we have people

436
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,319
watching from around the world

437
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,680
probably used to teachers not needing to

438
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,519
buy supplies for the classroom

439
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,040
