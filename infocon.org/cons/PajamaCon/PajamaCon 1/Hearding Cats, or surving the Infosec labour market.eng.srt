very happy years

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,280
um i didn't have to worry about security

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,319
but

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,239
but the main thing was

62
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,760
actually building building great user

63
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,000
experiences and not

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,679
not security at the heart of it um

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,560
seven years ago i i i moved back

66

um in the next couple of months i'll be

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,159
returning to the labor market because

75
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:13,519
uh the corona crisis resulted in

76
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,480
even worse financial situation than the

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,480
company

78
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
apparently has been in for for quite a

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,560
while so um

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,879
um somewhere at the end of this year

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,319
i'll be looking for other work and i'm

82
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,920
skipping ahead um and and finding myself

83
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,319
yeah figuring out what has changed in

84
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,399
the past seven years

85
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,000
which was the last point in time that

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,959
i've been actively searching for new

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,120
work

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
um and i figured out not much has

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,040
changed um

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,680
recruiters reach out uh um to you on

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,159
for jobs that you're overqualified for

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,040
uh or or well under qualified

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,679
um hiring managers that haven't got a

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,959
clue what

95
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,239
uh you know what they need what skills

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
people need

97
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,040
um and i've seen this before in uh and

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,599
in the past years with friends of me who

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
work

100
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,439
freelance or i had to look for other

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,798
jobs because they were working in toxic

102
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,159
companies for

103
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,599
really poor management and i see that

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,720
it's it's

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,680
i actually for the past 10 20 years

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
i don't see much change in terms of how

107
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,120

your ass

134
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,360
activity for a hiring manager instead of

actually doing what you love

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,520
and working working on things that

137
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,679
actually not only help a company or an

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,799
organization work for grow but also grow

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680

141
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,120
and and

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,960
interesting working life um

143
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,280
so um

144
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,318
having looked at the um uh you know

145
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,638
where i need to be

146
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,600
myself uh in a couple of months from now

147
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,400
i decided to see if i can find another

148
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,160
way

149
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,159
to to turn the tables essentially

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,759
because the

151
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,479
the talent i was talking to chris

152
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,600
recently about this as well

153
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,680
there's so much talent out there

154
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,199
you guys are capable of doing amazing

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,840
things

156
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,120
yet if you are entering the market if

157
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,919
you're looking for a job

158
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,360
what i see is is is recruiters who are

159
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,960
looking for

160
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,840
uh you know um feeling in impossible

161
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,599
uh positions because of all the skills

162
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,799
that the people think

163
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,800
a single individual should possess um

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,960
and actually the recruiters and the

165
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,199
hiring managers are having

166
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,799
an issue understanding and translating

167
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,400
their actual needs into

168
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,039
uh a sane resume and pulling the people

169
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,840
in

170
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
that they that actually can make a

171
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,919
difference

172
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,800
if we move away from um

173
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,198
skills-based tvs where all they want to

174
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
see

175
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,319
is which type of firewall you've been

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,758
able to configure

177
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,520
um or you know

178
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,759
what other technologies you've been

179
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,560
supporting to shove into all kinds of

180
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,720
companies you've worked for in the past

181
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:30,160
so um

182
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,280
what if we would be able to

183
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,520
change this and actually start to

184
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,280
uh use the skills and the knowledge we

185
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,400
have and the insights to

186
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,599
uh to create a future where we're more

187
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,960
in control

188
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:49,680
of why we're hired

189
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,758
and we're getting out of the hands of

190
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,400
the recruiters with the firms that are

191
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,440
now just scorching

192
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,039
linkedin and and scraping resumes

193
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,719
to see if they can make a little bit of

194
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,159
a margin on a tariff or a shitty

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,319
compliance job at an

196
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
insurance company or a banking company

197
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,479
or any other

198
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,759
other company so i um

199
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,080
i firmly believe that we have

200
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,840
and we should be much more capable to to

201
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,800
actually trigger that change

202
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,960
um and create a world where we're firmly

203
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,800
in control of that

204
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,799
so while i'm looking for my next job um

205
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,080
i'm i'm i'm currently investigating what

206
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,360
we can do about this

207
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,199
you know which um kind of platforms can

208
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,240
we build and create out to create

209
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
ourselves

210
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,479
uh to change the job market uh in favor

211
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,279
of ourselves

212
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,000
um because i think we need to step up

213
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,040
and get more

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,279
back into uh control of our future

215
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,719
and um and and the work we're doing and

216
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,600
the value we can add

217
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,440
um to any company with the qualities we

218
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,760
uh we jointly possess

219
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:01,200
so um i promise it would be short

220
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,160
um but i think this is uh the word the

221
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,800
world is ours

222
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,040
and uh and i think we should take it so

223
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
if you have any ideas or interested just

224
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,599
hit me up on

225
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,000

226
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,920

227
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
evangelist

228
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,000

229
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,279
u.s with the same name i gained a couple

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,279
of followers due to that

231
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,360
they left as well because i'm working in

for sex or like to swear a lot

233
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,880

uh and what type of work we're doing um

240
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,760

that's that's that's happens often uh

267
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,680
just when i'm listening to what you're

268
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,600
saying i'm wondering i'm going to do a

269
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,359
thank you to all the speakers and the

270
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,640
sponsors

271
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,640
and uh i'm wondering if everyone who

272
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
participates wants to

273
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,839
add their linkedin and the profile so

274
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,360
that we can connect

275
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,360
the pajama con people

276
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,560
so i guess we'll get the thread going

277
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
we'll see who connects up but

278
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,640
uh maybe we can build a bit of a career

279
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,240
network within the people who attended i

280
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,839
know a lot of them aren't on

281
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,600
the call anymore because different

282
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,279
people are in different time zones so it

283
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,680
but we'll try and get things moving

284
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,680
forward

285
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,680
excellent
