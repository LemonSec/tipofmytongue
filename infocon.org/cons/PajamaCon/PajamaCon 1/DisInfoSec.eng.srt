part of this fundraiser so i have i

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,360
think about 10 minutes to

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,880
talk about the symposium so

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:19,280
the genesis of this info set

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,839
was right after the covet 19 pandemic

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,840
got

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,280
serious in north america like around

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,600
mid-march and

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,360
all of a sudden people in our community

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,280
were talking about

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,479
doing online events and

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,920
of course the many hats club

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,039
and you know cyber sex stew and

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,040
you know beer con

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,399
um cyber sex stew

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,119
and company host these really great

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
many hats club events constantly i've

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,240
been

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,159
honored to be a part of a few of them

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,320
and a part of uh

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,640
on one which was a lot of fun december

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,639
uh he started talking about doing some

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,760
more online streaming events

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,238
and then someone else in the industry

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,760
who i

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,840
really look up to leslie carhart had her

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,319
pancakes caught

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,040
and i found out about pancakes con a

56
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,399
little late on twitter but it was before

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,400
the event happened

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
and i was like yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,319
reserve a spot so i can

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,440
attend and both rooms

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,720
both virtual rooms for pancakes con

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,800
we're all reserved

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,480
and i was so disappointed

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,080
so then i thought why don't i do my own

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,480
event

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
and you know and i thought that's crazy

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,040
kim you

68
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,440
do your own event you've never done

69
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,400
anything like that before

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
but i pushed myself and i sent out a

71
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,080
tweet saying hey

72
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,079
if we did an online cyber security event

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,800
but featured disabled speakers

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,239
would you be interested because i'm

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,680
disabled so

76
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,760
i figured by focusing on featuring

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840
disabled speakers

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,159
i could differentiate my event from the

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,159
other events

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,480
and i get that tweet got like an

81
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,760
overwhelming response it got like

82
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,119
hundreds of likes and retweets so

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,399
wow i guess maybe i should do it then so

84
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,319
quite honestly i've never done any like

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,280
i participated

86
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,640
in online streaming events like this one

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,920
but i had never been the administrator

88
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,119
of any event like that and honestly

89
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,920
beyond the scope

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,360
of the work that i'm paid to do i don't

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,640
know what the f i'm doing

92
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,680
i know i know writing i know research i

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,518
know

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,959
anything pertaining to writing and

95
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,080
research and

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,959
cyber security but i knew nothing

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,959
about streaming a video event so

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,839
i you know i got you know chris you

99
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,519
offered to help

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,959
um but basically i had to figure it out

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,720
myself

102
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,519
um i had a lot of encouragement i set up

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,080
a

104
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,199
web page i reserved the defeat this

105
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,919
infosec.tech domain

106
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
and i plugged a github web page on it

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,440
and i opened up for calls for proposals

108
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,039
and there were a few that came in

109
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,000
now i'm quite well versed

110
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,840
in disability culture not just cyber

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,199
security culture

112
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,599
in disability culture

113
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,120
if someone tells you they're disabled we

114
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
take you at your word we don't

115
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
we're not like i want to see medical

116
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,919
documentation

117
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,880
or anything like that so

118
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,080
i just i let people who self-identified

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,199
as being disabled

120
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,320
any disability you know

121
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,840
physical cognitive

122
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,479
you name it if anyone considers it to be

123
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,359
a disability

124
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,359
and if you

125
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,680
if you either work in this industry or

126
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,759
you've studied

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,199
information security and you have

128
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,280
something to say

129
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,320
then the culture proposals were open to

130
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,520
you

131
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,960
and i got some really really great calls

132
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:43,039
for proposals i got like tanya janka

133
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,239
i got i got jessica schultz but

134
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,919
she ended up not being able to present

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,520
because of things that were going on in

136
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,680
minneapolis

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,758
um i can go to the website here

138
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,919
there were a lot of great presenters

139
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,680
there was a guy named b

140
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,280
who was talking about neurodiversity

141
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,240
and agriculture we had michael middlemen

142
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,559
and andrea downing spencer hundley we

143
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,160
had

144
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,360
thinker we had cerani mcneal and asher

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,560
lee

146
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,400
and that was of you know i there were

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
some technical difficulties with the

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,400
early presentations as you're gonna

149
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,720
probably see on youtube

150
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,318
but i was really impressed with all the

151
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,400
content that everyone had it was

152
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,520
absolutely stellar

153
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,000
and especially like tanya janka as you

154
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,359
know is

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,600
is an old pro so

156
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
so the event happened saturday it was

157
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,120
originally going to be saturday june

158
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,319
13th

159
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,600
and then right at the end of may early

160
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,319
june

161
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,160
everyone was distracted by what was

162
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,199
going on in the world with

163
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
black lives matter with george floyd's

164
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,520
murder

165
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,599
and i thought how about we reschedule

166
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,639
this to give people a little more

167
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,080
space and people on twitter seem to

168
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,080
think that was a good idea

169
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,919
so i rescheduled to july 11th

170
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,840
and that was actually pretty good too

171
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,120
because it gave me some more time

172
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,440
to figure out how the f i was going to

173
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,800
do an online streaming event

174
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,800
so it gave me some more preparation time

175
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
and i basically figured out everything

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,520
myself

177
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,120
i bought like a paid zoom account so i

178
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,080
could host a lot of different people in

179
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
the same room

180
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,400
and be sure that the session would be

181
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,080
encrypted

182
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,198
i know zoom has well-known

183
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,520
vulnerabilities but in the end i decided

184
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,240
that it would be the most pragmatic

185
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,240
choice

186
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,319
for streaming platforms we went with

187
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,680
that um

188
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:55,520
i decided to live stream this infosec

189
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,240
on both youtube and twitch

190
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,878
so i set up those accounts properly i it

191
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,080
i figured out how to use obs studio

192
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,759
just very basically and use that with

193
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,520
restream and i

194
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,840
tested the various technicalities i

195
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,479
spent 120 of my own money on a webcam

196
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,119
because uh with all this people working

197
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,039
from home

198
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,639
and using zoom stuff the price of

199
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,840
webcams have gone up

200
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,319
so well i'm glad i got a webcam you know

201
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,599
that was

202
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,479
that was a good investment in the

203
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,719
peripheral and

204
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,758
i thought that it would also be good

205
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,399
even though

206
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,440
the event was free for anyone to attend

207
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,839
if we

208
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,919
did a fundraiser did a fundraiser for

209
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,640
organizations that are run by

210
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,640
disabled people because in the

211
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,760
disability community

212
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,880
we usually find that when organizations

213
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,920
are not run by disabled people

214
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
but they're presumably existing to help

215
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,000
disabled people

216
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
they don't tend to help us at all they

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,959
tend to

218
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,480
have a harmful effect so it was very

219
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,000
important to me

220
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,000
that the funds that we raised went to

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,560
organizations run by disabled people so

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,120
i'm a little biased because i'm autistic

223
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,680
i i

224
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
choose chose two organizations run by

225
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,160
autistic people

226
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,399
the autistic self-advocacy network and

227
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,920
the autistic women non-binary network

228
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,040
but i thought

229
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,599
i should also support an org that helps

230
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,800
people

231
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,600
with all disabilities so

232
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,760
i did a lot of research and so

233
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,279
organization number three ended up being

234
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,760
the council of canadians with

235
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,800
disabilities

236
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,200
and the fundraiser was very modestly

237
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,479
successful we raised about

238
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,320
seven hundred dollars so now i

239
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,560
i'm splitting that between the three

240
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,920
organizations

241
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,119
and i can see you know even though early

242
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
on there were some technical

243
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,399
difficulties

244
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,399
i considered the event to be a success

245
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,040
and obviously i've

246
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,760
learned things from running this infosec

247
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,000
so

248
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,040
if we do it again in six months to a

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,079
year

250
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,279
i'll note i'm doing a little bit better

251
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,560
so if you missed the event

252
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,079
if you go to disinfosec.tech there's a

253
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,439
link where you can find

254
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,319
the youtube playlist that i created

255
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,839
and you can watch the whole six and a

256
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,120
half hour event

257
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:37,200
divided into nine videos

258
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,920
and if you want to find out about

259
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,000
any future this infosec events i

260
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,199
strongly recommend that you visit the

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,160
website and

262
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,360
sign up for the mailing list and any

263
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,760
important updates

264
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,279
will be included in that mailing list

265
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,279
and there's a sad peek at you

266
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
so yeah i would consider it to be a

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,920
success so

268
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,440
i'm considering hosting the next one

269
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,439
either in january

270
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,120
2021 or july 2021

271
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,800
so we'll see how it goes whether it's an

272
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,760
every six month thing or

273
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,760
or a yearly thing

274
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,000
and that's all i have to say unless

275
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,000
anyone has any questions

276
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,680
does anyone want to unmute and ask

277
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
questions of

278
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,920
kim

279
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,880
i'll ask a question do you think that uh

280
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,920
this lovely copic pandemic

281
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,800
has um

282
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,360
enabled a lot more people especially in

283
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,359
the disabled community to

284
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,440
feel comfortable going online and

285
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,680
attending various conferences because i

286
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,120
know at least from my point of view

287
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,079
um it was almost four years i was in and

288
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,360
out of a wheelchair

289
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,239
so me visiting a conference was very

290
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,880
difficult

291
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,519
and i wish that there was more online

292
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,439
stuff so do you think that it's helped

293
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,040
yeah that is an absolutely excellent

294
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,200
question and

295
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,439
yeah i mean i'm not physically disabled

296
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,040
but people in our community who are

297
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,360
physically disabled

298
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,599
especially wheelchair users or people

299
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,720
with chronic fatigue syndrome

300
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,680
or conditions like that definitely not

301
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
having to go

302
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,439
to another city and stay in a hotel and

303
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,839
face

304
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,200
a venue that's possibly not wheelchair

305
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,800
accessible

306
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,880
that's a big bonus and

307
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,479
people don't need as much energy to

308
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,040
participate in vents

309
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,959
from home if they have chronic fatigue

310
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
syndrome or chronic pain or something

311
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,800
like that

312
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,599
um i'm comfortable with

313
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,959
talking to people online and video

314
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,079
streaming for an extended period of time

315
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,439
uh sometimes

316
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,839
if people have social anxiety it might

317
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,800
help if they can talk to

318
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,600
500 people without seeing what they look

319
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,439
like

320
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,160
so they feel like they're just in the

321
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,440
comfort of their own home

322
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,199
yeah i i would say that yeah

323
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,959
generally speaking having the event

324
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
online does make it more accessible to

325
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,800
disabled people

326
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,320
and there are a lot of disabled cyber

327
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,839
security professionals

328
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,839
so that's a plus

329
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,120
okay well i i want to congratulate

330
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,760
tim for running such an awesome event

331
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
and

332
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,120
hopefully everyone signs up for our

333
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,399
mailing list so you can

334
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,399
