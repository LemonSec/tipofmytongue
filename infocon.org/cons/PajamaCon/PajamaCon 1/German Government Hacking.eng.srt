1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
operations and other just we're talking

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,920
about

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,439
cia fbi uh a lot of coordination he's

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,440
basically doing their job trying to do

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,160
their job to get the data for criminal

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,160
investigations

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,080
and um with that over to you

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,279
yeah so the first fun fact is

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:31,839
we're german and we do beer but

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,840
so don't expect it too much

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,320
yeah all right all right so

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
um the german constitutional court

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,799
actually put a lot of

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,840
um safeguards in place uh for limiting

15
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,320
law enforcement from

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,600
basically uh trying to do their job and

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,559
conduct government hacking

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,679
so in 2016 the government agencies

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,759
finally

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,080
were done with their first kind of own

21
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,479
hacking software that they could use

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,679
to get all the data of the criminals but

23
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,360
because of the restrictions of the

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,000
constitutional court they ended up with

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,400
a

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
government hacking software trojan

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
malware

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
that could only convert record skype

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,439
conversations

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
and only on windows platforms so as

31
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,960
millions of euros and dollars went into

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,439
a malware that could do one thing record

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,000
skype conversations that's all a lot

34
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,119
more

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,360
nothing more fun

36
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
fact number three is um the

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,799
self-programmed remote

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,000
forensic software built by the federal

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
office for

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,759
criminal investigation to infiltrate was

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,158
so bad

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,240
that the national cyber security agency

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,240
which is actually working to defend

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,399
against any such software

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,119
had to support write the code and secure

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,598
the software at the servers

47
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,560
the support was supposed to be kept

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,040
under the waiter

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,800
as the image could be damaged and

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,000
obviously what happened

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,720
everyone found out and now um there's

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,879
those trust

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,120
issues between companies and civil

54
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,879
society and the cyber security agency

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,879
which is supposed to

56
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:32,160
defend uh against everything so

57
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,239
not so helpful fun fact number four

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,000
in 2017 the german government actually

59
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,720
set up its own entire agency

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
which was dedicated only to buy and

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,599
research and

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,879
program tools for hacking and big data

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,720
analysis and stuff

64
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,720
and they are supposed to give those

65
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,959
tools to other law enforcement agencies

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,319
and

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,040
security agencies in germany um problem

68
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,879
is

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,440
they so far have not succeeded in

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,079
developing buying or doing anything

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,879
remotely useful as of terms for hacking

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
tools for

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,079
other police agencies and

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
which is why the security agencies are

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,319
not very happy with all the resources

76
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,359
that went into that agency since 2017

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,200
because it has delivered zilch nothing

78
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,599
nada but then again on the plus side

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,319
after two years so 2019 it was finally

80
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
operational

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,079
only took two years to make it

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,399
operational and uh by the way it has

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,560
like

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:32,159
only 100 stats it took them two years to

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:36,319
hire 100 120 staff

86
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,239
so another fun fact um in 2014

87
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,359
germany's federal office for criminal

88
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,000
investigation

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
hacked the secure telegram messengers

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,799
accounts of

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,080
eight persons the users of these

92
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,319
accounts were suspects

93
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,239
in ongoing criminal investigations

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,359
against extremist right-wing

95
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,200
groups um the hack allowed them

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,040
to access the entire history of the

97
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
non-encrypted chats including media

98
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,120
files connected to the accounts

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,439
as well as new messages in real time

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
the hack used a mixed mixture of

101
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,560
features and flaws in the messenger and

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,159
account design

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,280
and it was a whole lot of work to get

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,280
there involved also the

105
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,200
telecommunication provider

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,279
and then the data that was obtained in

107
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,238
the hack together with other pieces of

108
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,478
evidence

109
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,239
was then presented in the court that

110
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,520
eventually convicted the suspects

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,520
in spring 2017 but there was additional

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
human intelligence information from the

113
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
domestic intelligence services as well

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
as

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,599
compelling evidence obtained through

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,080
conventional wiretapping

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,440
so the latter actually led to the

118
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,120
evidence of

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
led to the evidence that was then the

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,040
basis for the indictment

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
so the whole thing was probably

122
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,600
redundant

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,800
in fact number six so we are now having

124
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
a couple of laws on the table in

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
in germany and if all those laws pass

126
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,479
through the parliament and autumn this

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,919
year which hopefully they don't

128
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,080
um they will enable security agencies to

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,599
mandate telecommunication providers and

130
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,479
service providers and over the top

131
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,919
services

132
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,599
such as whatsapp that's how they are

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,280
defined

134
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,000
to deliver malware directly

135
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,520
to the users so you're gonna get

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
poisoned what's up updates

137
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,960
specifically only created for you with a

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,440
nice backdoor

139
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,799
and even better because they can involve

140
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,160
the internet service providers and they

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,360
work together with our

142
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,440
beautiful finfisher company in munich

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,759
they can actually they can actually set

144
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,360
up proxies that automatically deliver

145
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,320
that malware whenever

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,800
the users go to a certain website and

147
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,280
conduct

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,919
a beautiful man in the middle my way

149
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,520
delivery

150
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,520
we are so excited about that

151
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,919
so fun fact number seven um it has never

152
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,759
really been evaluated

153
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,039
rather government hacking led to any

154
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
real successes

155
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
in lowering or preventing crimes

156
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,039
nevertheless

157
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,800
their state level legislations and

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,440
federal legislations

159
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,840
are still being proposed that eventually

160
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,840
all security agencies should just do it

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,160
fun fact number eight uh right the

162
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,759
current status quo is that every

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,360
government agency in germany can do with

164
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,479
vulnerabilities whatever they want they

165
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,240
don't have to give it to the cyber

166
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,960
security agency they don't

167
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,160
have to give it to the vendor they don't

168
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
have to give it to anyone they can do

169
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,520
whatever they want sometimes

170
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,758
they can just keep it in the basement or

171
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,560
in the safe locked up and not talk about

172
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
it for years um but the funny thing is

173
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,160
no one wants to change that

174
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,440
uh there's processes that we've been

175
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
talking about for three years right now

176
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,319
which we want to establish also based on

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,039
the american vulnerabilities equities

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,199
process

179
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,039
but uh neither most of the civil society

180
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,720
groups uh nor industry

181
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,318
nor government agencies actually wants

182
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,840
that and they don't want to change the

183
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960
status quo even though the status quo is

184
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,479
basically horribly

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,039
horrible for everyone uh law enforcement

186
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,159
cyber security agencies uh civil society

187
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,159
but no one wants to change it

188
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,800
so fact number nine even though the

189
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,080
focus of those legislations that we've

190
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
been mentioning

191
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,000
are more focused on domestic and

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,759
national security

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,680
the cyber security policies and

194
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,639
strategies that are being communicated

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680
are actually super defense oriented

196
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,160
aiming to achieve

197
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,520
it security and resilience for society

198
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,199
and businesses

199
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,799
in 2017 um the german government even

200
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,880
proposed in the agenda

201
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,080
uh to have the goal to become the crypto

202
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,039
country number one

203
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,560
in the world so the german government

204
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,400
doesn't seem to understand that

205
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,319
government hacking does not necessarily

206
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,000
increase ig security

207
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
or in general they should maybe learn

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,720
more about their cyber stuff and

209
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,319
differentiate a little bit more

210
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
so if you know things like we're really

211
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,199
disorganized and nothing is working in

212
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,400
germany and government hacking is kind

213
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,199
of a mess here

214
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,638
you're right but as we are very german

215
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,840
of course we have a great

216
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,759
structure and a perfect organization

217
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,159
when it comes to cyber security

218
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,440
so uh you and i spends the last hour to

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
draw your little picture

220
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,719
of how the german cyber security

221
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,800
architecture looks like and

222
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
that's how it looked like uh so on the

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
top in the blue you see the european

224
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,240
level institutions which are connected

225
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,039
to the gray level which are the federal

226
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,919
institutions

227
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,000
which are connected to the purple ones

228
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,680
which is the state level institutions

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,280
we haven't come down to the local level

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,599
yet because we were running out of time

231
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,960
but that's gonna be most probably next

232
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,960
so if ever you think

233
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,479
cyber security in germany is not working

234
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:41,838
yeah that might have

235
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:41,838
something to do with that

236
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:55,839
like that

237
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,640
can you guys hear the cyber cyber or not

238
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,800
christian could you hear the

239
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,800
last video

240
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,399
ah so maybe we just post the link into

241
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
the chat groups then

242
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,080
okay it's a video of

243
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,319
politicians saying cyber because they

244
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,440
all want a cyber

245
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,440
without really knowing

246
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:43,200
so does anyone have any questions for

247
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:51,839
julia and and sven

248
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:55,440
you'll have to unmute yourselves to add

249
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,120
so the two of you don't think that uh

250
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,160
the german government uh especially with

251
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
uh the lovely jubbly who does what and

252
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,719
whatever

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,240
have the capabilities currently like the

254
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,240
dutch government do for hacking

255
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,439
so for for i i i mean for law

256
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,120
enforcement uh

257
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
no most probably gonna end up buying

258
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,519
some stuff from finfish or celebrate or

259
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:27,120
nso maybe not who knows um

260
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,240
the military also not

261
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,720
uh we're yet unsure about the

262
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,760
capabilities of the

263
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,360
foreign intelligence service it's

264
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,000
something that we don't know a lot about

265
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,720
it but honestly from what i've heard

266
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
i don't think so

267
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,959
for those who don't know uh the dutch

268
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,160
government was the first government that

269
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,959
um put in writing that uh they had the

270
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,839
right to

271
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
hack into any device anywhere in the

272
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
world

273
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,600
as long as a dutch prosecutor signed off

274
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,199
on it

275
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,519
so it could be an i.t iot or ics system

276
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,720
and they do a lot of hacking into for

277
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,240
example

278
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,720
cctv systems to get

279
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,920
footage of criminals or nation-states

280
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,200
the absolute proof of them hacking into

281
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,199
various government systems

282
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,479
so i just want to give another minute

283
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,120
for

284
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,120
questions

285
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,839
is there anyone else who has any other

286
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,839
questions

287
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,640
yeah i see the question in the chat

288
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,319
about maximator which is the uh

289
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,000
the company which was set up between i

290
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,160
think the u.s and german intelligence

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,560
agencies to develop a crypto tool which

292
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,279
was

293
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,880
a great crypto tool because it was uh

294
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,720
only secure

295
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,399
for certain people and for other

296
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,519
governments they sold an insecure

297
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,399
version

298
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,839
um and let the germans and the americans

299
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,720
have access to all the communications

300
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,320
running through it

301
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,240
and the great thing is we even sold it

302
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,560
to some of our allies

303
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,600
um yeah that was kind of uh that was

304
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,959
kind of story here

305
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,079
earlier this year um i don't i don't

306
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,079
think we can repeat that

307
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,880
and on the other question if we have

308
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,279
like um the u.s cyber command

309
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,200
we do have a unit that's also horizontal

310
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,120
so pulling everything everyone who works

311
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,480
on information security

312
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,839
across the military but their

313
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,839
responsibilities to defend their own

314
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
systems

315
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,120
yeah and then maybe spend correct me if

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,839
i'm wrong

317
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,000
but i think technically or theoretically

318
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,900
if parliament signs off if they are

319
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,160
going into um

320
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,920
[Music]

321
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,079
into war then with with any country

322
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,199
and if they're sent there then they

323
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,000
could use

324
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,250
offensive tools there as well but i

325
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,920
don't know of any competitive cases

326
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,920
[Music]

327
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,959
uh yeah so so you need a parliamentary

328
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,040
mandate

329
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,160
for military operations uh afghanistan

330
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,719
was one thing that's the only thing we

331
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,680
know

332
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,560
that in afghanistan the um german

333
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,680
military cyber operation unit took down

334
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,599
some cell phone provider

335
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,319
a telecommunication provider but that's

336
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,320
the only thing we know

337
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,959
any last questions

338
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,040
okay i'd like to everyone who has their

339
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,439
camera on or microphone unlocked give a

340
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,839
big

341
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,839
hand of applause to julian smith

342
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,530
[Applause]
