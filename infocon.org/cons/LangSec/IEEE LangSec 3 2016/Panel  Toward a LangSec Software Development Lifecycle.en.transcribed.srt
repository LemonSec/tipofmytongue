1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
of course what we do about this is we

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,500
want people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who write software to</font>

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,620
actually think in these terms before

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,719
they're a weird machines there emergent

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:20,330
machines make it out and so today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:24,509
have a few themes a few recurring themes

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:30,359
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put into questions and I</font>

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:35,270
wonderful<font color="#CCCCCC"> could discuss them so what do</font>

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:43,170
we do how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lasik closer to</font>

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:46,410
filter yo my cycle right what did what

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:51,410
did make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for other kinds</font>

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:55,468
of solid software development practices

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:01:00,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">pre-check in chips right you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't check</font>

14
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,489
in if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks bad right and there are</font>

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,700
people who try to score code before

16
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,009
champion to tell the programmer<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you</font>

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:13,350
really really perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not be</font>

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:16,920
checking this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in are you sure but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh can</font>

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:20,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of code metrics that are a part</font>

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:27,240
of a complete charity breakfast checking

21
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:31,439
right what role does machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning</font>

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,199
play in this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard from two</font>

23
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,929
machine learning efforts today and in

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,420
both there is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> being learned</font>

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,840
about the data now machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning is</font>

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,270
notoriously hard to use in production

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,350
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps the score is derived from it</font>

28
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,939
the metrics direct from it are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:02:02,130
match because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people try to people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

30
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:04,579
to establish one chicken how much

31
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,250
technical depth you might be introducing

32
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:09,660
with all of your data data is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll find</font>

33
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,520
out is that this

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:18,690
the code if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> screw up your input data</font>

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,570
format your code will for sure be on

36
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:27,690
salvageable as we saw with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntp case</font>

37
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:30,600
and you know how can we reduce that

38
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,760
computing power that we're grunting to

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,000
the attackers may be through some sort

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,149
of step down<font color="#E5E5E5"> EMS where you cut out the</font>

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,240
main Turing complete piece as Rick was

42
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:47,370
explaining and then instead of useless

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:51,300
use the VMS SZ still down power a

44
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:54,560
step-down transformer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to protect the</font>

45
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:59,550
rest to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that computational power</font>

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,070
to isolate the attacker from so who

47
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:06,270
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the phone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

48
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:10,680
defecate or more one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these or share</font>

49
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:15,810
some ideas among these not just maybe

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll toss about an angry so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think if</font>

51
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,600
you want answers to these questions you

52
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,090
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to very clearly articulate to</font>

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,190
developers what guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

54
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,209
get out of adopting a particular

55
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,940
framework to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool you know just as</font>

56
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:34,980
a concrete example here what then

57
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,930
yeah I think actually earlier what that

58
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,019
damn i'm going to get from having or

59
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,630
using something like credible how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

60
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:48,480
going to say what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> votes has</font>

61
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:50,970
eliminated and so their velvet<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

62
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,910
things need to be concrete to me because

63
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,650
otherwise your largest telling them hey

64
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,570
use formal methods and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll be better</font>

65
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,300
and safer oh but<font color="#CCCCCC"> four methods are hard</font>

66
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,269
as Matheny all those excuse we've heard

67
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:08,190
so to me that's that's kind of the core

68
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:10,680
thing that hasn't been articulated yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

69
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,320
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this thought is an important</font>

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,310
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to apply it specifically that</font>

71
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,798
first point and

72
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are discussing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier about cold</font>

73
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,989
mornings I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any nothing metric</font>

74
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,630
we can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with that is likely to</font>

75
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,580
guide us towards good<font color="#E5E5E5"> code but not</font>

76
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,070
guarantee you guys toward zip code where

77
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a real possibility that there's</font>

78
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,469
a good reason to do things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this weird</font>

79
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:39,080
way it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up creating false</font>

80
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,139
positives and more noise and more

81
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,150
resistance to conformity to whatever you

82
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:46,639
automated tools are the checker quality

83
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,799
rather than accomplishing our goal so I

84
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,440
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

85
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,960
work on is if we can say oh we want to

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">improve code in this way we have to come</font>

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,750
up with a code metric that's going to

88
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:03,888
have a negligible or actually ideally 0

89
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:06,380
false negative rate so that our fault

90
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,810
mother realistic so that so that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

91
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,090
report something to a programmer this is

92
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">something is helping a programmer to do</font>

93
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,219
what he or she<font color="#CCCCCC"> is trying to do rather</font>

94
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,139
than something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is distraction or</font>

95
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,030
yet just<font color="#CCCCCC"> now they're going to jump</font>

96
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,430
through or just none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the place where</font>

97
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:27,799
I put a comment in so that so that they

98
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:29,910
could be exploited later well the other

99
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:35,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">times do that babe you should</font>

100
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:38,040
as mentioned earlier the keynote coffee

101
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,469
is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be doing the right thing</font>

102
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,560
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier so that you know</font>

103
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,930
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> both methods you need five people</font>

104
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,250
as opposed to 50 or by writing in

105
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,890
grabbing a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you copy one</font>

106
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">software you're committing down fraction</font>

107
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,969
and these are things that are actually

108
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,530
wanted level and you don't even need to

109
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,270
necessarily make me how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

110
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,669
saying oh yes security everything is

111
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,310
going to be scary but you can say okay

112
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:09,030
it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the first place and you</font>

113
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:12,440
also get security excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> people talked</font>

114
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:17,969
about today are also<font color="#CCCCCC"> quantified I think</font>

115
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:21,129
how hard is how awkward is his team

116
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:25,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">include penetration</font>

117
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:28,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's incredibly valuable that trick and</font>

118
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:30,529
I mean it is something we can do we can

119
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,029
obtain from static<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis and that's</font>

120
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:34,580
something that can go to code coverage

121
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:37,039
at works you're you're definitely right

122
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,459
that it's easier to do these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

123
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the correct way but the part that that</font>

124
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:44,599
doesn't connect with is that the skill

125
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,369
required to do that and domain elephant

126
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,979
bar do that is to feel about higher and

127
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:50,839
it's much higher part of a higher people

128
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">are people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that it is to hire</font>

129
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:55,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that kid and parser and make</font>

130
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:57,740
something sort of work about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

131
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,599
outdoors yeah you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concrete</font>

132
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of this like I work with people</font>

133
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">who are afraid of an apple and then</font>

134
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,179
they're afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> antler because the</font>

135
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:13,309
visitor pattern is when they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

136
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:16,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">much like I I little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt this at work</font>

137
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:20,059
i chained seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years on using other and</font>

138
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:23,300
building code to walk our streets and

139
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:24,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's once you get it it's something but</font>

140
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">its total is what I think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

141
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:35,050
and it's not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can easily go</font>

142
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">just hire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for 25 necessarily</font>

143
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:46,610

who have these skills and convincing

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,620
people to develop these skills is also

155
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,960
difficult thing but what step in that

156
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,480
direction might be is we can take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

looking at lots of different types of

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:52,700
we can somehow quantify that actually

167
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,310
across the board we have numbers hard

168

numbers rather than oh I know a guy who

knows a guy who have this experience we

<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons I think that you've seen the</font>

cryptography a specialized domain much

186
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:41,119
like me you ought to make parsers is

187
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:43,639
that there have been a lot of bugs that

188
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,319
have been very clearly mapped to a

189
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:46,879
cryptographic failing that could only

190
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:49,939

191
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,439
and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's certainly things</font>

192
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:52,998
that we've heard today have demonstrated

that we have a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools now in</font>

certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the trend is</font>

198
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:07,759
unfortunately heading but what we need

199
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:09,350
to do is I think continue to work on the

200
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,379
winning<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearts and minds battle that we</font>

vulnerability like these in MTP we do

203
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:19,939
more than simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> states here is some</font>

funny

Lang sec type failing was responsible

209
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,069
for this by being inducted into the

point in internet time this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever I</font>

this and to the NSF and when I feel to

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:17,730
group I need the responses but the

crypto is it as a lot less Krypton

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> every application has taken put</font>

it yeah every application has to do a

256
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:57,389

these sort of arguments to traditional

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,510
like it's a domain-specific language and

00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,720
they take a whole bunch of code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,569
correctly maybe also simpler to validate

that it's actually functioning right so

272
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:37,410
yeah so one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font>

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,959
themselves into quite overloaded data

288
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:43,830
that controls code that controls

289
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:48,810
execution so um we probably and if you

290
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:52,830
can sleep of translating a lasik

291

<font color="#CCCCCC">same lines of please send us a note</font>

293
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:08,249
after all we need this this area

294
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,610
succeeds by communicate and if you have

295
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:17,220
the right average if you have the right

296
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:20,670
slogan we want to hear from you so ah

297
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,100
but what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

298
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:27,269
who do work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry what would it</font>

303
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:45,629
but rather here is a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works</font>

304
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:52,079
with other lists<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the grammar in a</font>

305

306
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,979
industry hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not the only one</font>

307
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,709
I hate this to the extent that I

308
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,129
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're getting at it's a</font>

309
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:07,649
question of 41 most penetration testers

310
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:09,509
are unaware of these principles and so

311
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:12,209
it would be extremely odd for a

312
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,829
penetration tester to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> even unless</font>

313
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:15,599
they can find a beer<font color="#CCCCCC"> mission even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

314
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:18,149
much as why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the case that this</font>

315
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,529
input grabber happens tutorial eat too

316
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,329
much less complaining about shotgun

317
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">cursors because unless they find the</font>

318
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:27,149
vulnerability they usually will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

319
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,579
fighting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it might be useful to</font>

320
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,250
try to work with someone like<font color="#E5E5E5"> miter to</font>

get as<font color="#CCCCCC"> w/e</font>

322
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,050
if there isn't anyone I certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

323
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,550
find one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> word for it last and that</font>

324
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be the reference database that we</font>

326
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,070
these sorts of things written into

327
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,620
standards so that there would be some

328
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,660
power to compel once<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients to actually</font>

329
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,120
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of thing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way</font>

330
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,180
that I can say it is deprecated shall

331
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,850
one as a few months ago must stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

332
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,040
it that's very persuasive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can't</font>

333
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,380
really dude same thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> one second so</font>

334
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,420
it never ends up you more than an

335
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,640
informational level 80 this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

336
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:08,569
we kind of look at so make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

337
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,480
reportable finding yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the sort</font>

338
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,760
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea you know you put a show</font>

339
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,150
that bar sir basically should be a

340
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,650
recordable finding well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

341
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:24,800
doing it an efficient test level every

342
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,420
bit too late because<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that point the</font>

343
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,450
shotgun pulse has already been written

344
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,980
it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard argument to make</font>

345
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:36,140
to say oh you should rewrite your

346
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,580
software from scratch because also the

347
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,490
reason image<font color="#E5E5E5"> though is that the</font>

348
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,770
penetration testing tends to be what

349
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,890
drives the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development that secure to</font>

350
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,139
all the life cycle it does get<font color="#E5E5E5"> invented</font>

351
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,400
in such a way that it makes it easier

352
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,060
for the company to pass penetration

353
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:56,210
choices well in the industries that well

354
00:17:53,060 --> 00:18:00,620
but the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective approach might be</font>

355
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:02,930
to have to get it into a development

356
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,060
mindset of them the way you pass an

357
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:10,150
input is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're right</font>

358
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:12,010
and ideally build the<font color="#CCCCCC"> library's maybe to</font>

359
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,050
some extent make pasta generators will

360
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">approachable or friendly go out there</font>

361
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,980
tell people about the right to tutorials

362
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,730
make the boring bill integration etc

363
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,410
straightforward enough that people will

364
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,110
actually do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they won't think I</font>

365
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,630
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open up another and queer thing</font>

366
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:33,129
but oh I can read this blog post once on

367
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:35,980
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use and toy use these awesome</font>

368
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,540
generator frameworks and there are now

369
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,740
to save time<font color="#E5E5E5"> every time I write a</font>

370
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:44,800
program so we're liking not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDs but</font>

371
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:48,040
tw's but blog posts as well whatever it

372
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:52,600
is so on the topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of making these</font>

373
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:56,680
things like reportable you know blog

374
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,020
posts like there's a big weight that I

375
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,170
can say hey all those that like Sakura

376
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:06,010
see so coding guidelines from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sir right</font>

377
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:08,650
if there were like asserts<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lang second</font>

378
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:12,330
guidelines that was like a point<font color="#CCCCCC"> to soar</font>

379
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:16,140
proactively to developers and say

380
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:18,939
classification and what sort of so

381
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:24,070
Google I know google has its own style

382
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:27,840
guide probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too right do</font>

383
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:31,659
these things get consultant open enough

384
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,600
are they is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good target to</font>

385
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,309
try to get them to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font>

386
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,559
those kinds of listen I get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bburg</font>

387
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,230
words you don't have automated trips

388
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,539
after lunch acted you're following those

389
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,309
lives it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that to</font>

390
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:51,539
developers mind when they start coming

391
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:54,520
out every day 50 items they have

392
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:56,080
typically winter set up just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify</font>

393
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,539
that but they don't show it reference

394
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,908
like content that's how do you write a

395
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:06,640
letter or yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> lender fooling sec well</font>

396
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:09,970
so what we've heard from ya<font color="#CCCCCC"> Catherine</font>

397
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">dose oh we're says the earth towards</font>

398
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,900
that end<font color="#E5E5E5"> papers my experience those</font>

399
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,789
internal sorts of coding standards

400
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,870
documents are authoritative that

401
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:18,460
companies that have a maturity

402
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:22,090
development life cycle which is really

403
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,909
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only place this battle is level with</font>

404
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:27,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">that said yes it is the case that it</font>

405
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:28,720
tends to be those rules in those guides

406
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,850
and it's not just I'll guys it's also

407
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,730
secured developer place I

408
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">putting requirements on those rules that</font>

409
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,299
are amenable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linton you happen to be</font>

say hey there's a violation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,900
assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they understand the</font>

414
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:50,130
subject area well enough to actually

415
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:54,210
notice it and these it is it's a list of

416
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:57,780
perhaps 300 500 individual requirements

417
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:00,120
written in abstract language it can be

418
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,780
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very painful if there were</font>

419
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:07,168
some way to use the team tracking that

420
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,030
we have work it into something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

421
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:11,760
static analysis tools similar to

422
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,530
Coverity then you could end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

423
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">area where it's necessary for developers</font>

424
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,760
to at the very least write a comment

425
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,289
that says hi by housing was checking the

426
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,570
will have a mind with<font color="#CCCCCC"> roomies sorts of</font>

427
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:24,390
things but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be the practical</font>

428
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:25,860
consequence but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things work</font>

429
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,960
to drive developer where it is these

430
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,850
guides are usually meant for reading and

431
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,340
they are well followed so I'm hearing

432
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:35,340
that it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me it should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a part of</font>

or gurus except not for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what except</font>

437
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:56,900
not for length set are these are

438
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:03,890
the standard libraries like everybody

439
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:04,990
that's why I else really there's parking

all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> designing do you like would</font>

you want her over and programming<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

446
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,120
kind of stands to reason it will be

447
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:26,920
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible</font>

you rather pay for education teacher

454
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,090
issue is just that no one is really to

sets please strip this throw it in the

467

garbage and just the standard money and

468
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,480
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even need it to be exploitable</font>

470
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,150
service and one thing you could do if

471
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,620
you have it in ascended Light Rail at

472
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,140
least might be accepted is you could

473
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,540
also change me by your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO libraries to</font>

474
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,540
enforce passing at i/o time so you can

475
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well roll by taio in itself is</font>

476
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:38,629
not necessarily the deprecation or

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,639
potentially unsafe<font color="#CCCCCC"> API or whatever the</font>

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,610
way you do in put up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is you have</font>

480
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:51,889
either get back so now make a make ECW

481
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:54,950
40 by taio yes we're in fact oh yes

482
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:59,620
that's I mean Haskell arguably does it

483
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:04,480
but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course it doesn't have</font>

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,479
industry following machine

485
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:20,779
yeah there are corners of the world

486
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:25,589
where hostel is very hot so let's see a

487
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:28,529
bit extension points then extension

488
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:32,039
points how can we burn<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I mean can</font>

489
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:35,899
we can we say just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use Htrae XML</font>

490
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:41,158
entities let's say look<font color="#E5E5E5"> some out right</font>

491
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:43,518
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> X actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do just exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well we</font>

492
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,829
say that too but I didn't have currently

493
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:49,229
XML NT external<font color="#CCCCCC"> X and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all into the</font>

494
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:52,559
inclusion it's generally viewed as a

495
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:54,509
problem and there is a one command thing

496
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,339
that you can do to initialize your XML

497
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:57,839
parser for virtually every standard XML

498
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:03,809
parser that just disables these six

499
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:06,859
point blank this reminds me of I<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

500
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:09,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">options which works she is standard</font>

501
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:12,529
indispensable and now are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much I</font>

502
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:17,969
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only place you see though is</font>

503
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:21,299
ideas signatures right and I'll with

504
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:23,559
with blog this packet so wouldn't it be

505
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:25,269
nice I think it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes on a crane</font>

506
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,070
alternatives the people want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

507
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:29,409
instead of this eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets</font>

508
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,600
removed like you look at Mike sequel

509
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:34,539
injection and it will never<font color="#CCCCCC"> go away so</font>

510
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:39,070
long as you still have seized by nature

511
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:42,658
of the spec so keep hammering right yeah

512
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:45,730
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is an instance where</font>

513
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:47,980
it was somehow received that you need

514
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:54,490
the extensibility that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

515
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:55,869
fields and for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a parser</font>

516
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:59,379
company and a lot of reason whatever

517
00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:02,619
more powerful ways building proper

518
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:05,320
parsers kind of gives that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> present</font>

519
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:08,320
that option that hopefully you mentioned

520
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,019
of doing things because suddenly you can

521
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,570
afford to roll roll your own to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> c</font>

522
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:15,519
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> make specific language that has</font>

523
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,918
the power that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need instead of</font>

524
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:21,820
saying oh no I can't write a parser for

525
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,639
God's sake I have to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML and extend</font>

526
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,379
it with some traffic but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start</font>

527
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:28,658
bringing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> zach's a partial Dominator</font>

528
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:30,009
into it like which all rhythm do you use

529
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:31,869
and then if you're writing different

530
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:33,700
languages you have to understand it

531
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">other than enough that you can say why</font>

532
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,820
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write my grammar this way because I</font>

533
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:41,990
know

534
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:47,389
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle any case this is a play well</font>

535
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:49,730
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> but thats I say this I mean you</font>

536
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:53,900
always have to deal particularity of

537
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:56,060
your system but one point is that which

538
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,900
we did with hammer is that we have

539
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:03,730
multiple backgrounds and it will use the

540
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:07,580
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> general one that it needs basically</font>

541
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,590
at that point this gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the denies</font>

542
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:13,310
ramp where you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on the down</font>

543
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:16,449
by modifying your grandma and it's it's

544
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,450
not really complicated

545
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:27,450
c'mon story about sequel injection was

546
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,460
certainly an interesting one to the

547
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:32,130
reason that this is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer as much of</font>

548
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,610
a problem as it has once been is that

549
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigation is trivially easy on we</font>

00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,020
will infer all your sequel for you but

559
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,900
many programmers finding these things

560
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,220
easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use than then its sequel now</font>

561
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,920
they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid of writing single</font>

which is exactly what one wanted if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:53,920
are these trivial to me once

576
00:28:50,380 --> 00:29:27,860
it gives you a treat for naught is not

577
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:29,810
right oh oh once you sort of you know

578
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,310
the issue would possibly do it is that

579
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,409
you need to understand your house and

580
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:37,940
how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this seems like a very</font>

581
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:39,950
leaky abstraction because yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's ali</font>

582
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,480
average indiscreet I mean the original

583
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,830
string developer probably knows that

584
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,300
there are different parsing algorithms

585
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,800
but you don't want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in your</font>

586
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:49,159
mind all the time while you're writing

587
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,990
program and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do if you to keep</font>

588
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,120
it in your mind you still might run into

589
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,400
the situation we should be self

590
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,909
different somehow let's be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I oh</font>

591
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,740
yeah no I mean I wrote it also do

592
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,250
how is this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one's got great</font>

593
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:05,020
for it I cannot explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all to you</font>

594
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,630
like it makes in this like<font color="#CCCCCC"> senses it's</font>

595
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,650
easy because it's simple errors

596
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,470
Brazilian starting anything complex

597
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,850
that's where it becomes like this engine

598
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:18,450
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem unless you really know your</font>

604
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:42,310
end and really perhaps a subset of that

605
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:45,550
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they did not say the</font>

606
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:48,520
words grammar but the way you construct

00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:51,010
those serializers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> D serializers they</font>

608
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,740
are essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> combinators and these</font>

609
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:57,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">Combinator's are very very few and of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">course I'm sure people do unadvisable</font>

611
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:07,120
things like create dependencies between

612
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:09,040
objects that are so encoded in then rely

613
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,889
on those dependence is being there

614
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,710
without actually verifying them but the

615
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:17,230
core language of proto puffs makes it

616
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:20,860
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to actually encode of</font>

anything that's she realized that he's

618
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:27,370
you know at the course you realize say

619
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:29,830
this but one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons / lovers are</font>

620
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:32,620
useful and actually have some traction

621
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:35,409
is because a lot of the time I'm a

622
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,419
programmer I'm thinking oh I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

623
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,840
from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> object that's native to whatever</font>

624
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,990
lame

625
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,549
and I need somehow write this to a dish

626
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,950
or sentence on a network or something

627
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:46,720
and oh there's this there's this

628
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:49,000
definition for how to do it and there's

629
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,039
already a library for all I have to do

630
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,779
is make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a proto buffer and what other</font>

631
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever language i'm using there's</font>

632
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:56,679
already something there that makes it

633
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,960
really easy for me to solve this problem

634
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,120
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

635
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:04,450
serialization say you're saying that

636
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is normally language for this this</font>

637
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:10,360
is for that meat type type of into my

638
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:13,779
personal library or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

639
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,059
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i type in the in the true sense</font>

640
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:19,750
right in the hip another<font color="#E5E5E5"> sentence um</font>

641
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:21,850
sure um what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting at is simply</font>

642
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,429
that were making then that the protocol

643
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,870
buffer by virtue of<font color="#CCCCCC"> softness support</font>

644
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:28,240
software that's been written for and

00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,549
made available<font color="#E5E5E5"> in with bindings for lots</font>

646
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,340
of different languages makes it so that

647
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it actually is easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve the</font>

648
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,350
problem in a way that's visible to

649
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,110
programmers from then then doing an

650
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:43,449
autumn on their own and the real success

651
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:46,059
if if we're trying to get people to say

652
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:48,010
oh I need to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of</font>

653
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:49,600
language I didn't come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with reading a</font>

654
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,820
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> and making sense of it or something</font>

655
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that then then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to actually</font>

656
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:57,850
get our cars for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Combinator's and</font>

657
00:32:54,610 --> 00:33:00,520
related tools to be easy enough to use

658
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,620
easy enough to put into whatever coding

660
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:08,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">really can't say oh and easiest way from</font>

661
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,110
you to solve this problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to call an</font>

662
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:14,049
order pull up nickname me whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

663
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:15,729
tool is and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it solved the problem</font>

664
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:26,800
for me so

665
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:30,990
wait here do you want me to do is

666
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,990
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of generating unit types to</font>

669
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,540

670
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,800
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that is easiest right now</font>

671
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,020
there are language<font color="#CCCCCC"> dependent</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">serialization forms that are designed to</font>

00:33:53,020 --> 00:34:00,639
go from a binary to a full-fledged

domain object of an arbitrary type of

675
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:09,190
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a fundamentally</font>

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:11,890
dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> period ruby-on-rails learned</font>

677
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:14,350
that the hard way huh so he also happens

678
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,000
problems with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple Chavez problem</font>

681
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:25,060
this has had problems because the entire

682
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,590
point of that interface is to take a

683
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:32,070
string from under from presumably

684
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:36,820
presumably trusted source and executed

685
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:43,810
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> viet it is code execution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

686
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:48,530
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should further we should make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

687
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:51,230
as horrifying<font color="#E5E5E5"> for developers to use that</font>

688
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,450
as to propose an SQL string them using

689
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:56,060
the concatenation operator so what I'm

690
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:59,990
hearing is hide the language behind the

691
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:04,880
library make that language make that

692
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:07,490
library create types that map a whale to

693
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,410
the data types but not to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

694
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:16,759
types yes and in particular do or do not

695
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:19,100
use any odd serialization<font color="#E5E5E5"> format ticking</font>

696
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,770
here they can serialize or deserialize

697
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,930
an arbitrary object so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

698
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,520
how are we going to get out of

699
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:32,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript the ability to evaluate a</font>

700
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:34,730

701
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,310
way really really easy way to solve the

702
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:41,570
problem oh I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> read a JSON object</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

703
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:45,680

705
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:56,839
out and and well it became known as

can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even begin Oh ranting about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

708
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:09,050
maybe um I don't know doesn't know is

709
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:11,350
encouraged or discouraged that or is an

711
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:25,000
truly this example I guess you really

00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:27,070
were not get endured hear that right now

713

no I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sacred and same with</font>

without making you jump through hoops oh

722
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,190
yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> right just just basically in</font>

in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame work in the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

fashionable framework just maybe they'll

725
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:06,910
do something else yes there's a point to

726
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">be made about the fact that Jays</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:14,220
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to be possible by</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">catch things and that you have to insert</font>

731
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,970
the script tag yeah but that's it yes

732
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:28,328
that decision

733
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:31,509
these things of convenience are what sdl

734
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:33,880
is designed to reverse and so by making

735
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:35,710
these things reportable and ensuring

736
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,799
with you in those places<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

737
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:40,539
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually following in stl the</font>

738
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:42,160
developers first objective is to make

739
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:44,799
their manager go away by making the code

740
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,430
work but objective following that is to

741
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:50,259
me the<font color="#E5E5E5"> penetration tester go away you</font>

742
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,240
know by rebutting all of the bugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

743
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:56,019
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have something that I can point to</font>

744
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:59,410
and say and I've already taped hey you

745
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:01,390
just evals you user provided data that

746
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,759
that is always reportable today and

747
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:06,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">anytime that it happens I can always</font>

748
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:08,859
hold the program's release hostage until

749
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:10,329
they get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it if we simply make</font>

750
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:11,950
everything else like that and at least

751
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,769
in most companies where this incentive

752
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:17,890
is created it will work because you

753
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:19,180
can't force the developers if they're

754
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,250
not willing to thinking about security

755
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,319
to do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't already in any other</font>

756
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,640
arena and unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a secure</font>

development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle they're working in</font>

758
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:32,330
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just eval user data but of course</font>

759
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:35,840
any input<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is a program and</font>

760
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:38,529
think I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very good point I</font>

761
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:42,830
think at a certain sense a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

762
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:47,900
these issues that we're discussing just

763
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:50,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the last few minutes or I'm afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

764
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:53,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">say but already kind of solved like you</font>

765
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:56,510
say the eval you can hold a pull the

766
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,920
release hostage for it even though

767
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:02,750
people and still make the mistake but

768
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've also heard the parser Combinator</font>

769
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:08,810
libraries are crazy popular in some

770
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:12,140
circles and I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that they</font>

771
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:13,670
aren't in some others may simply be due

772
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:17,200
to the fact that I don't know these

773
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:21,940
things propagate for something or it's a

774
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,819
it's a restoratory grown ecosystem or so

775
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:28,190
ecosystems many a<font color="#CCCCCC"> key word because</font>

776
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:31,570
program has used what's what's available

777
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:35,540
or what's common law was fashionable in

778
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:37,580
their ecosystem so that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,700
motivations behind hammer right to

780
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:46,759
simply establish a tool for sea center

781
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:49,819
ecosystem and in my mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the problem</font>

782
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">then becomes more one of making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

783
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:55,130
people find the languages

and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parses that they should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

786
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,160
easy to say oh here's a pulling in a

787
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here are you pulling in the network</font>

packet there you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to parse that</font>

789
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:08,670
somehow where's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> parser that's</font>

790
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,399
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's also easily</font>

791
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,559
auditor you say okay what is your

<font color="#E5E5E5">partial look like for this for this</font>

00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:27,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> future direction is</font>

00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,759
to just try to find out where where are

the languages hiding their letter beyond

00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:38,869
the horses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I forget where but we've</font>

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:42,599
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> is somewhere during the day about</font>

799
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:45,900
what complexity is hiding<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in the</font>

800
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:48,240
interactions inside program so i think

801
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,890
that feeds back into the load having the

with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> d mp3 parser was the this</font>

separation between the handling enemy

808
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:17,100
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want our programs to</font>

809
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:22,000
basically look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these strings of</font>

strings of whatever so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have you know</font>

811
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,440
just one edge that goes from one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

it's a pipeline things it's nice so it's

814
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:34,029
an interesting interesting it's

815
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:37,510
interesting note to finish on we started

816
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:39,420
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> unix pipes and a composability that</font>

that allow the system to flourish

818
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:47,080
perhaps we can reboot the ecosystem with

creating by creating you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>
