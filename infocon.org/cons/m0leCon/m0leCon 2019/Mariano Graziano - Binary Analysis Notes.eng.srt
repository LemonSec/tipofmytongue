1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,409
we have very little time when it seems

2
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:04,390
we try to be italian a little bit

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,039
then obviously i'm at work for

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,509
cisco carlos with a former student of the

5
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,549
polytechnic of turin i am not

6
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:14,710
informatics telecommunications and turin

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,120
telematics

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,370
therefore i found i am a

9
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,970
cyber security in derby with in france

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,230
then we obviously leave they

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,390
look  will start a bit to explain

12
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,640
what maina grandi is because it serves us

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,490
as a bit how it works we will go equal to

14
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,860
focus more on the lover more from

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,020
a point of reference and then we will go to

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,420
see an internal moment of the format

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,580
of the executables in a format  l then

18
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,450
let's try to understand how a

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,600
general binary pay perhaps very

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,600
clear in mind how a

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,420
binary has been generated obviously I want everyone even at the

22
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,360
cost of chromatic bari and will sell them the

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,000
information networks of

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,340
compilation quickly poverty languages so

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,470
look interpreted that your soul does not

26
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,110
think a  graph and after friends

27
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,690
we have to compile so we start from the

28
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,760
cod  ice source

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,340
then abolishes machine what you

30
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,110
said so variously it was too more

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,740
complete there are 14 early stage in which

32
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,770
all define includes are instant

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,720
what is the compilation in which this

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,540
code is translated to us then china

35
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,470
checks then they are made of wait in which

36
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,050
then follow it precisely from the

37
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,840
generated term po the machine code at the top

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,360
of the winter if you do this then they will come

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,910
according to the context program a bit

40
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,280
together with the part of nichi and we will

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,990
then have out our executable our

42
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,729
binary which later will be a pin

43
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:53,229
we manage wages curve I put it

44
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,780
communicates the straight love that criticizes the

45
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,240
cloths of because on the very common info

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,860
that there is the part of but from what it

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,720
means it means that when we go to

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,510
compile our program we compile

49
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,060
statically therefore three  age libraries

50
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,070
have already includes the ok program

51
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,370
will not be dynamically loaded

52
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,150
obviously some programs with

53
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,190
interpreted but also many times it

54
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,050
has already won in accomplishment  lation then

55
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,590
a certain bytecode point in memory ok and

56
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,140
then a plus 20 hoaxes on this

57
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,060
because we are going to see a demo because

58
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,810
there will be time

59
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,410
a calculation new people

60
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,200
the name of the file per minute of the target

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,300
on the subject of faber who has

62
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,520
practically no companions  install then in

63
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,620
general

64
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,490
ok then we will see how to pour the streets

65
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,080
then the code of this skinny so never

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,240
even understood how to dine I know that in

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,420
a super fast way he is a Milanino here the

68
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,370
things to do variants of the art of

69
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,060
understanding then a program compiled from the

70
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,770
code  machine to try to go up

71
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,070
from the stand ideally up to 9 10

72
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,740
then do the process we say inputs

73
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,430
with a compiler obviously we take

74
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,640
from here there is machine at stanley

75
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,810
we do the operation which is called

76
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,630
in stanley that of having a tour

77
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,140
which is called dida  stand of our under

78
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,320
train of devices

79
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,100
let's say May 15 let's see it we have a

80
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,160
couple of deputies let's join the data assets but

81
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,020
that a tip as online for a trip to

82
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,050
assemble and  we see that

83
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,320
the felix 86 table is equivalent

84
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,320
we want a formant with pop

85
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,490
we are inside a

86
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,700
circ architecture therefore complex the screened then

87
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,010
from the bezel and variable this

88
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,910
lends itself to various 33 people are used

89
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,580
because in the bathroom where he had to see the

90
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,870
doors the  tent place to have sales

91
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,060
line inside of cremona dynamite my

92
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,360
party backdrops from 04 for example I

93
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,640
will no longer have 04 cc and 5 of frignano zone

94
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,070
04 the other the slider part but that you

95
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,250
do me hours of real pato becomes an area

96
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,310
ok then  this is because I put

97
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,740
probably one learns moreover they are

98
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,560
interrupted unless an interaction that

99
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,330
since everything say sanders on

100
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,030
gladiators seen as doing the

101
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,920
interesting part that is very useful special

102
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,480
of life then a greater power than

103
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,860
twitter the principals in face are these

104
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,480
brigades bianca indeed

105
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,840
ok in which precisely exploited by

106
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,860
this part of the bezel by the souls you

107
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,280
can jam it seems in the middle of a file and

108
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,400
Italy seems to give a tool as if to

109
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,120
say

110
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,630
remedy  to the other police headquarters these

111
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,460
three titles that exist well with us he

112
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,650
had an eye on me I believe that we

113
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,930
expect you from here for free he said these

114
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,900
things

115
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,180
so we must understand with the bay of

116
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,220
what we want to understand 15 machines

117
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,650
way from an application to understand that

118
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,199
what does the behavior and

119
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,470
quality enter how can we do this

120
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,120
exploited with following demons calls

121
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
offered channels so we do not believe

122
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,020
the program we take it we have to

123
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,889
understand it to follow it ok this how

124
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,060
we can do it we can do it

125
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,350
instrumentally in various ways

126
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,930
looking trivially spoke of an idea

127
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,750
of  strings of electrical tape will want to

128
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,850
pay color maid to certain

129
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,740
calls leader linate gravel to get

130
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,570
an idea of what happens

131
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,800
when maybe symbols that have

132
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,229
developed those we have little to say

133
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:49,229
written luminaries then taking what

134
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,850
concept is not to sleep the track that

135
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,930
there are no i

136
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,320
come from the broadcaster

137
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,370
pulls ok that is the binary ninja yields at the

138
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,460
moment l  flour oil cost of three

139
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,060
wounded

140
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,510
maybe I have a license that costs

141
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,550
relatively little compared to air

142
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,050
and then you have it then if a

143
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,060
static part but already also wanting tebaldi

144
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,500
becomes pauline friend

145
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,130
now the other to realize the final is

146
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,230
all with the  dynamic part then

147
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,560
I run my applications I follow

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,340


149
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,390
my my program how can I do it

150
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,460
I can do it with a debugger or I can

151
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,900
just create an environment in the

152
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,360
instrumented of the instrumented bnd a

153
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,030
so-called tempo ok kiwi in which

154
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,700
substantially the taxes all elements

155
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,970
that the  ordinary it obviously goes

156
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,760
by executing it this milan inter a freezes it

157
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,140
interacts with the operating system I

158
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,380
have to pay close attention to lake

159
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,290
maggiore to adjust my nothing

160
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,280
otherwise I get infected with what was I

161
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,760
can do it here drain old on

162
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,130
demand for money that is more

163
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,289
than there  the

164
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,839
lion freezes for a theme that has gone that there is

165
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,149
a debugging part ok

166
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:17,339
or at least he kept it was also jackie

167
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,789
that maybe a  The public

168
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,029
ok that in fact it is a I keep first that

169
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:28,469
you mean instrumented then why the cream

170
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:30,569
the analyzes should be used

171
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,189
see why I have to go backwards to

172
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,020
from the code but also to do everything I'm

173
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,029
fine to understand that that good

174
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:39,479
application or turkey meat tv

175
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,369
level  how you become an activity they

176
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:45,089
call you say originating ok after

177
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,639
all malware will arrive malware is

178
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,339
almost never urgent so understand what it

179
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,979
does contested instruct it shocking that it

180
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,709
is still a mine to understand the

181
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,869
context or maybe the page comes out

182
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:04,360
during patch day  microsoft and therefore

183
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,150
let's understand the patch I go to see

184
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,479
that stability is overlooking a

185
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,150
card with to understand that a happy

186
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,710
copied me so to understand the first

187
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,490
in the inter or inter era

188
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,990
interoperability part this

189
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,860
reference reason there is a

190
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,770
proprietary protocol commander  smd I want to

191
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,590
create my klein that supports it

192
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,120
those you have more fans but to do it

193
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,649
I have to pay it all  o the protocol

194
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:36,309
because he never released o venturi

195
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,828
spin the positive example known as

196
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,419
crime est

197
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,969
I want that fears will enter in truth

198
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,839
I care while I drive here

199
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,600
various components are poured and the other Poles

200
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,300
autonomously others as interesting

201
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,399
replied it seems that then I take myself

202
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,260
understand them but at other times an application

203
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,089
that sometimes does things that make me

204
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,459
suffer the desire to change go in there

205
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:01,959
was a pop-up that

206
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,480
obviously leave a yearning

207
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,279
number I change his task

208
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,749
and then I veil a protected crime and

209
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:15,889
now here for you it is not modified because

210
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,180
these things also in general

211
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,550
considered quite difficult

212
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,470
what is called another marking east that is, it

213
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,079
hangs information I going from the

214
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,199
source code to the machine mouth for a fact

215
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,439
of information ok and therefore what it

216
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:33,620
means I do not know anymore  what principles must

217
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,420
be a time from the limit

218
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,680
so many times continued for example to

219
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,449
put up for sale of code in fairs

220
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:45,709
so I h  or a stream of bytes to

221
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,959
tell these things as given the

222
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,550
pattern assembly that the data tries to

223
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,579
assemble ok but black cat with cheater

224
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:54,740
how many times understand the shot that becomes

225
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,569
a bit of a problem because you lack

226
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:03,470
the information very well could we sell

227
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,139
short finely antiqua at the

228
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,860
linux level what is the how the trend and risk and

229
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,720
what is called three german then

230
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,490
that situation cricket of mag ok the

231
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,709
first place and level that said or

232
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,889
come a bit of shopping offers the list

233
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,440
has not opted for fear

234
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,140
are  quite hyde the ingv at the

235
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,030
scope level really almost use ok let's say for

236
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,760
this according to these effects finally

237
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,090
1.63

238
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,790
ok the things he says oh well then ended up

239
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,860
with a malware trainer three monsters

240
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,050
certainly don't go unless then he does a

241
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,220
lot of candied I don't do it  for

242
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,230
linux i did it in general the important ones

243
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,810
20 possible for the wet things

244
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,790
change 23 pending

245
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,270
obviously nothing of the youth world ok

246
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,210
obviously android based on linux ok

247
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,560
so we have dic  we a little bit the

248
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,230
android machine for the strong linux part and then

249
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,600
we have an intuitive

250
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,310
virus but also the percentage is

251
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,690
really of us there are many wars instead it

252
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,640
changes everything I have created in which the world

253
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,920
delays ok let's say criminal must not

254
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,360
watch the movies that  they have the only ones

255
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,660
therefore that applications are in a

256
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,260
fire file of the elf format they are 70

257
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,590
percent so that I maybe want to

258
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,510
catechize more firmly because

259
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,750
Campania I need a lot of bandwidth ok

260
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,280
because I want to create once they

261
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:48,960
pay maybe because of Italy morning

262
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,790
the world  manga that situation

263
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,180
there are many and we say many people of

264
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,240
what he said ferocity the malware

265
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,030
the lion sure opening instead that it is not

266
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,530
exactly like

267
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,940
that that is muzzano her mario for a very

268
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,440
banal this world said

269
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,890
users with or very few

270
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,150
lately then there is  thanks to the

271
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,130
exclusion of the interior so far for

272
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,990
with the aid devices

273
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,050
we say community scenarios revolt

274
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,250
thickened even with a chance of that

275
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,250
what you data of the report nor did I look at

276
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,800
that definitely had a

277
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,030
high impact there is also no impact then

278
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,930
always America

279
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,420
therefore very strong and then connects Roman

280
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,670
handcuffs the forces that mainly among

281
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,350
the Chinese on the level of infections of the

282
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,230
file what is the problem related to the

283
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,480
manual also to look at the first batch

284
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,530
that himself to infect ok what

285
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,280
they do is historical will name skills

286
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,310
north so they rely on the fact that it is

287
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,530
a chip years will not flock like

288
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,910
termites or reason with the services

289
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,500
the  module for all polluting they wanted to

290
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,890
see the classes that make the known

291
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,920
brought the stroke and the scarelli

292
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,470
the handles were used mind with maybe a lot of

293
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,230
dots then various war iii f zurla ok

294
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,460
here the rich a voice shelter just above

295
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,530
gallipoli casts a track of the

296
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,480
twenties or  the fall you don't even need to

297
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,190
do this in greece in your own trivial

298
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,890
what you do you move to shop

299
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,180
unlike you I have seen many times it

300
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,660
has interested you I want  I a

301
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,640
clarification showdown

302
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,980
there is also a bit of luca look at the

303
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,300
credentials times ways of making a good

304
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,250
point program offspring and many times

305
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:07,440
many times chosen by the families they closed

306
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,880
the mandolin on many

307
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,000
some models of the components are stopped all

308
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,829
are already there are also in  bank this

309
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:18,779
interesting because it means that for the

310
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:23,250
sphere of the German how are meat

311
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,240
servers mirai weekend it is pretended that a

312
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,160
very interesting market because it was obviously multi-stage

313
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,779
made by an attacker who

314
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,660
against and therefore coach was a state with

315
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,339
disturbing like 500,000 routers and

316
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,800
campaigns law of the valleys  other types of

317
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,699
families so there are many families that

318
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,680
involve different categories of mario

319
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,779
we take it from the banks we go to

320
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,010
adults we go there from a trivial saying ok

321
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,839
we then take many times also he was

322
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,730
devoted to be a doctor

323
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,019
the situation at the level of numbers then

324
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,430
what of the statistics those  from various

325
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,230
stops who is

326
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,420
the de facto speaker plus so much to get

327
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,440
an idea of mag

antivirus aggregator youtube praise a little binary do

330
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,900
the scan in ripoli refused

daily they receive let's say two podiums

335
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,620
of malware

336
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,660
when we are over a million and we see

337
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,130
that we have won more obviously

338
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,530
knowing that we have 36 per cent German for thread

339
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,090


340
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,220
we definitely have the magistrate who I would call

341
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,210
the fearsome

342
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,740
mayor my name is android trimble canvas and

343
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,490
the car

344
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,720
ok then you serve the musical games you and I

345
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,120
have the  'I waited and then quoted the owner

346
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,770
then informed but in May instead not

347
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,690
only yesterday dealt with the world obviously involved

348
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,140


349
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,120
ok here the numbers are these so in the

350
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,730
end I would have ex means that even then

351
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,370
learning the skills and target intano the

352
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,020
third imprisonment after a minute after

353
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,950
android

354
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:30,940
ok there is the third most used format and

355
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,710
now we see how many over the years as meat

356
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,420
of the situation in this always in the

357
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,440
3d graphs from to  ristotele the week and

358
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,850
2016 so you know 6 pm ok we see that

359
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,650
then in blue we have the file number

360
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,470
in the Hindu orange files ok I

361
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,550
am widely envied by the new ones

362
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,320
I have already seen meters however we explain

363
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,530
that over the years what the 18 and

364
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,089
19 confirmation  this trend the

365
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,270
volume number escape luthor gal is charged

366
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,450
nine times ok and these could

367
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,020
also attribute concrete aids to the whole world

368
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,869
all these new devices and

369
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:22,329
therefore allow many times bari explains

370
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,839
autonomously 32 winners are

371
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,190
subjected to a service as never

372
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,220
taste of  ok this to have an

373
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,510
indicator on who how

374
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,860
the trend climate is changing now so to have understood

375
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,740
more or less likely the particular

376
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,450
bajani life what it is

377
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,980
we understand latin the situation

378
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,190
regarding the thirty-year-old state of

379
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,670
linux

380
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,460
so it is growing now come  boast

381
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,290
this format since then what

382
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,510
is not the noise however to the explains I activated

383
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:07,330
daughter of the web format to one thing that

384
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,170
I would like

385
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,820
once this totti comes out that it

386
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,140
remains in my hands because she makes two

387
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,310
let's say more ok there is one more linked

388
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,770
let's say to drinking is one linked to the

389
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,990
execution I could say that is the

390
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,060
same format these revised from two

391
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,370
different perspectives one for when I cut

392
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,310
the track  and on disk another time

393
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,050
instead

394
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,080
nice memory ok I can read it in

395
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,460
two ways to pass then reformed I

396
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,140
can pass it a ladies point of view by

397
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,710
conveying the sections after passing

398
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,540
as logan from a point of view then

399
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:48,030
of the memory cloths of the segments ok and the

400
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,400
things change and only on schedules

401
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,680
diamantino this the art the cat latin motto

402
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,090
as done we give the first part

403
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,950
of murray in which my lover

404
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,470
basically to doctors of

405
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,870
the ares ok we see the times so what kind nothing

406
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,070
can we give paris there can be nor

407
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,580
livable can  being a live chat

408
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,210
for this is important because this is

409
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,310
a hole in the call center lay the

410
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,000
machine and says architecture ok

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,250
nothing index while bridge of progr  amma

412
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,630
so they have to go with the girl is

413
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,030
fundamental

414
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,030
and then obviously I have the whole part o to

415
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,210
watch two different defections and the

416
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,750
program

417
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,840
so let's go to say this array

418
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,700
this of the various changes

419
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,260
ok instead 12 registers in which I have friends

420
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,080
that the other ok the  end this to understand

421
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,060
that that is an fps

422
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:58,040
the letter is right then the various

423
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,610
interesting songs you can go and see then

424
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,250
later on from an example then we have the

425
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,680
machine and as I said that precisely it is

426
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,910
the architecture says

427
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,480
ok it for bayern but the

428
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,000
supported architectures ska health segments ok

429
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,010
segments then taking that with a

430
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,960
part of view

431
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,010
when we go to look

432
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,290
in memory-related format then in lauder if

433
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,810
someone followed them load disk the

434
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,720
program allows the memories to understand it

435
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,320
sparta the ferments ok a segment with

436
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,380
contain  zero or more zero sections

437
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,900
because perfection are over there on the disk

438
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,840
so they have to logan i don't

439
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,610
even care sometimes link they want

440
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:52,820
obvious references  a segment to

441
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,080
another structure

442
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,900
ok various films also type and in

443
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,790
this charity every every stop with in the team

444
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,180
for at least one pil to

445
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,940
rechargeable locable insertion because it must be

446
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,980
in memory

447
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,530
ok usually it is normal in screwing

448
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:20,530
listed in the 2nd that then we have this

449
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,770
it can be keep it dynamic and for

450
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,050
the Russian company the roget and

451
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,010
dynamically calculate and various others let's

452
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,150
say these are

453
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,960
this we hurry as I fear that we are

454
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
in care with the time to cut

455
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,260
retail however the tool that the demand

456
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,720
we can go and see all that

457
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,760
which concerns the various schools plus that

458
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,380
guy you want we can see to

459
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,840
buy the sections st references ok

460
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,420
and it is a command that they want to

461
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,140
distribute the price list the format of

462
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,390
the power levers someone send with various

463
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,280
songs we see green the first

464
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,130
we then type

465
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,590
we start from the meaning we are looking for

466
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,600
to build the so-called of bridged to

467
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,470
say these mantles that force slow

468
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,190
we work  meaning ok so

469
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,100
interesting they come to italy instead

470
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,440
this is this field here

471
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,760
this is the field in a field of the rei

472
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,330
di haydn

473
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,750
ok and it is set at 1 let's see what

474
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,820
this field means in this field it is

475
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,760
this here is a sample but you for the

476
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,210
coin  and specifying the calculations what it

477
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,180
means more here tried to say

478
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,700
what kind of engels a grape this this

479
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,970
is ok

480
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,430
some given one because we are on an

481
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,720
internal machine and the telenia ok now

482
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,660
let's see what happens when there is very

483
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,820
interesting c  'it is widespread throughout the

484
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,510
heats

485
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,060
you have all the explanation dividing

486
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,580
the various co2 formats

487
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,360
me then substantially specifies

488
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,570
sixth various meanings from telephones

489
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:20,780
then over many possible 11 the

490
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:25,910
premier who then let's go to see a

491
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,040
less known technique also

492
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,030
recently released to  ancona 19 from a

493
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,210
spanish player drew the

494
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,750
linden of the shaboo the effect that with

495
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,650
mike basically goes to break all

496
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,080
public moods on the former

497
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,929
co  n a buy solo such as this one go

498
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:51,040
just this bike and this field here

499
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,520
ok it is forbidden you want but they work ok we

500
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,110
complain aspect increase because no

501
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:06,110
images received ok here less easy a

502
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,570
bit 32 commands elected the command to

503
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,640
avoid a directory of the normals that

504
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,510
the lowest lader  from the east it's ok let's see

505
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,600
they told us league information ok

506
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,140
this bike so this one here 0 1

507
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,850
then the inter is ok we want to do the

508
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:38,670
cdt of this perfect program it's

509
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,940
fine

510
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:52,890
keep going instead a bite ok let's see

511
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,520
to change bayern instead and therefore the future

512
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,730
here we get tough which means of

513
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,160
kenya ok for identical there is that piquet

514
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,720
ok lady says from here it happens that

515
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,560
we are next that after if my name is

516
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,500
we see caponi because we see these

517
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,420
errors because ridens makes you appreciate

518
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,860
our format says and picking and therefore

519
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,730
it reads

520
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,030
the other way around so basically

521
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,050
everything is wrong

522
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:38,280
gd the same thing you do the form of nine

523
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,100
focal lengths for ok so we can only

524
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,830
dance it we must then look out  what

525
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,640
I wanted to call these cases is to go and

526
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,610
look at what I find interesting

527
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,360
that the program works ok

528
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,670
attention what I understand almost revoked

529
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,000
by the public to confirm

530
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,640
how much friend it should be that it is

531
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,630
net and brought to the carnet here carried out

532
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,400
gang principles ok maintains a

533
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,770
matrix of  land to him the strength

534
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,860
I still believe that for this reason

535
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,700
to escape

536
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,230
this is not the bad one this

537
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,890
year the Italian bike that we

538
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,510
imagine for this exists nor dulko

539
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,200
stosur who makes if it were really a

540
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,430
shirt ok

541
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,580
us 4 published by manuele china 15 in a

542
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,730
hurry us  analyze it we can

543
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,010
not even large queens so I

544
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,140
have to go to understand in this they are a bit

545
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,610
banal from the strange group a

546
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,830
beautiful megan and trans what

547
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,090
Italy should be

548
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,440
maybe there is some time how to

549
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,980
understand it ok so this and I'm afraid a

550
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,360
super  fast also there to sell it then

551
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,310
where later fetus if they are various but

552
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,790
that

553
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:03,140
ok then ok inter in version of the gdc d  i

554
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,080
fig that is so you do not enter good

555
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,540
since there is one of the fields and while good the

556
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,250
monica entries where pretending to

557
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,799
point to nickname in reality it is not

558
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,080
really so a little more complicated in

559
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,660
general in a program let's say

560
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,440
dynamically delicate let's say torn

561
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,570
propped up stop this is a

562
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,110
genius function that deals with salewa

563
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,890
revitalization between the various

564
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,980
insertions takes care of calling this

565
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,370
function the great story start man that

566
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,520
takes pointers to functions that are mm

567
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,820
meters for neighboring purposes let's see how the

568
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,770
constructor we say the destructor

569
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,049
ok of the function then  now let's go to the

570
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:46,940
unexpected let's start with the identity of the

571
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,760
three times but to give what is there

572
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,330
we come this the extreme states ok

573
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,870
emiliano 44 mister my name is three languages

574
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,750
ok in which I am among the rights that

575
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,990
that note the constructor destroyer

576
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,840
of nain di  no but let's say all united

577
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,700
meter precisely to come for the

578
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,640
parameters and emails and therefore real mind

579
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,340
daring doctors was not where it ended

580
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,850
there onwards

581
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:21,290
ok builder demo but we believe that

582
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,419
this year

583
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,340
the national infantile vati then

584
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,419
adaptive of melo hunter all itis

585
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:30,580
techniques are those conventioned very

586
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,580
shortly before maybe they use

587
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,029
those techniques that even of the standing

588
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:37,299
tel

589
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,119
we can use the various all on the fact

590
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,970
that it is the  I make a set and with

591
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,809
an amiable length ok then maybe latella is

592
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:51,600
composed as if to force a moment

593
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,600
determining the various hips de van

594
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,970
what does it mean it means that for the

595
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,690
market debugger to my program

596
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,879
this program understands that the valleys are ready

597
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:07,029
and  ends he is not seeking conspiracy

598
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:10,659
his behavior is not desperate before

599
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:12,730
before these we briefly have what it

600
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,739
means to culinary writing then

601
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:18,039
remove those symbols ok

602
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,799
maybe remove all the information that

603
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,950
can help the finds phase

604
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:32,549
[Music]

605
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,280
ok

606
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,360
to which containing or rather us  they are two

607
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,500
twins compiled world compiled

608
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,620
normally and then the same two want to

609
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,300
tear it off we put a quot  in tripathi

610
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,250
obviously remove the information

611
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:10,860
ok then the size of the newsstand as of scrima

612
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,980
di fritta with the command streep

613
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,940
ok and then here remove you modify an

614
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:23,550
ok file which you are interested in opening for

615
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,840
example with aida

616
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,270
then the first before the normal role

617
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,930
licenses expired certainly also this

618
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,820
I wanted to take the train

619
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,330
then clearly went very strong manages

620
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,920
to catch our best in a hurry mind

621
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,630
then at least this

622
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,180
model box scenic constructions of the

623
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,060
horrible way goes directly because when I can

624
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,430
easily paper also tivoli to

625
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,540
understand how you

626
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,450
ok the we wish we are here and

627
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,730
we have nothing  in the super pace to

628
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,260
fill things change instead when it

629
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,040
is torn

630
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,830
when the primates that we go there the

631
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,330
lips continues the anas will note that

632
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,240
the intent of the gt we believe that aida has

633
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,310
fallen anyway because it recognizes this

634
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,950
piece we are there because the sea the dc

635
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,910
stuntman and tells us  even those e-mails

636
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,950
so it is quite sophisticated sometimes

637
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,570
we already send directly to  she

638
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,930
ok that is where maybe to go less

639
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,120
Maria later will do what christine

640
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,920
worker theater automatically

641
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,970
surprising but we do not start from there cnn

642
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,250
then here too we understand where but she does not

643
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,620
go and above all naples symbols to

644
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,400
understand that that open it catherine

645
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,260
because we make ourselves of stairs or  to the symbols

646
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,010
between the symbols as a command usually

647
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:24,230
this is defenseless ok nm we have it twice

648
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,860


649
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,040
ok including clearly

650
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,159
[Music]

651
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,749
ok including the main instead we don't get

652
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:36,440
to the one torn cicero film

653
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,299
obviously therefore not even aidaa tivoli

654
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,879
therefore filling semantics is

655
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:45,840
mainly more  complex ok

656
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,330
then partly torn let's start again

657
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,929
ok techniques cellars mag let's start by doing

658
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:56,999
this roundup how many ways in

659
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:59,749
the most common way patenting vargas

660
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:03,359
fortorino fortunately minute what

661
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,299
everyone knows they tell you help the p3 you are

662
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:06,659


663
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:09,989
ok clinician that I do this to myself that the

664
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,909
technique of a  common we are going to keep

665
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:15,649
more or less how it works

666
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,330
no this is not this

667
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:36,869
we start from this too  the most

668
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:38,909
interesting which according to this

669
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:41,580
one this one of the other ways and that of

670
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,559
this pocho at this moment of the

671
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:47,580
read a file toc toc without so it is

672
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,529
the current one of the program that is

673
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:53,009
running I want to see the files states

674
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:55,889
23 status there is a field  as a

675
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,349
text file there is an interesting field which is

676
00:33:58,349 --> 00:33:59,899
called 33 feet

677
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:01,830
obviously if this between the bankers

678
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,159
effected ok so if I am a trader

679
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,019
attacked one day they are all valleys

680
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:10,679
ok and then basically I

681
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,739
place malware place implement a check

682
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:20,039
like that ok  it is true that trying to go

683
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:24,029
were easy I find that this

684
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,799
function the tracks I did a mini

685
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:28,829
street and automates all the

686
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,869
big function thing clearly will never go

687
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,980
ok so a part I am

688
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,809
throwing it without the banks ok and turns and to

689
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:40,980
win  ok

690
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,799
you have to vague I do it in conceal time

691
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:48,779
the debugger ok that I start and

692
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:51,750
obviously it says that there is

693
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:59,220
1300 effect because the ok and then now this 1

694
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,319
bring you back to me perm  you will get bagher

695
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,099
ok here the traffic crisis of the trade

696
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:20,450
ok so I try to a new aa a value of

697
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,790
the p3 nate mountain and of the various

698
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,099
realities already using so I will have an error

699
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:28,570
because we can make a nature trade

700
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:32,270
process so making a circle

701
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,290
like that I but the  I can understand that

702
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,420
the buggies are strong let's start

703
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,760
this too ok

704
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,089
obviously then there is to be included among which

705
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:50,450
you straits decree of batak isla with

706
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:56,510
the upgrade ok then straits

707
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,880
ok are read vague so we put

708
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,750
all of cheaters on the tiger and then

709
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,300
what he was asking  go and do it myself

710
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,900
for years but these do not come when he

711
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,260
met di pestrin and somehow go

712
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,300
with the de ballet of higher never suffice

713
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,620
or kiss they

714
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,690
are parked in front of davide

715
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,600
[Music]

716
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:44,420
here instead what happened a few

717
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,960
minutes in the confirmation of the held in

718
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,100
line ok the ass rome from record an and

719
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,330
ok

720
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,800
because then with the female I'm going to

721
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,740
put a full

722
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,740
length ok

723
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:13,670
obviously that of destruction then let him

724
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,560
do the mag ok

725
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,680
and this int  ensity that they do owes him

726
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,770
something similar also enjoyed ok

727
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,970
what happens especially that to

728
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,520
fail general of the exceptions ok the

729
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,800
code of the mandate you make him angry

730
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,770
bastien of these years but maybe they

731
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,050
are already automatically take the

732
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,500
debugger so you have to you can say that he is

733
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,290
in the language  dari talete these superiors

734
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,000
who would resume bagher and launch the

735
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,210
brand ok but you want

736
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,859
the expected ok so even here we

737
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:57,890
want to launch precisely the dialogue

738
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:02,140
that we are grateful in then those ok

739
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:09,710
at the same time educational with the time and little

740
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:14,920
else check a bit trivial  what you can do

741
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,880
so interesting ok an angel who

742
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,339
can do you for the details that are photos the

743
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:27,980
basics of the culture of varied environments

744
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:33,440
ok then talk about the program but

745
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,339
if I play well and then I check

746
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:39,320
the content of these the riviera

747
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,020
environment extremely contains the  civil parties

748
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,640


749
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,330
ok obviously with the period varies and

750
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,830
therefore I behave like this in the normal sad cover

751
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,820


752
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,830
decides the inter appears and of mila

753
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,530
o  unnecessary transactions to confuse a friend to

754
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,680
go out, however, capturing a

755
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,200
photographically that up to a note

756
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,910
maybe above all the canti de balboa

757
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:09,890
canals for this but in general in

758
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,620
my opinion if one then there is maretta dinners with a

759
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,200
little some more or less strong data that

760
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,240
when it will serve actress  with other time

761
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,520
on the short term the environment that works

762
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,560
only if the companies maybe continuous

763
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,210
default because they want to control

764
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:28,250
mariani the life environment is variable

765
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,840
aretino their parodes ok where sex

766
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,720
the cool friends the program from a

767
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,100
normal shell

768
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,590
ok paying for nothing with installed  all

769
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,920
the default has determined a logic

770
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,310
sub-cycles they have others ok of this

771
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,770
mini match then to understand the whole round and the

772
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,470
gospel no let's say that the strongest one

773
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,450
probably in my opinion you clean

774
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,830
could be the one

775
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,950
ask for a photocopy and photocopies there is a

776
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,630
lot of information that substance more or

777
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,730
less  useful for making certain

778
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,000
checks

779
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:12,320
ok as superfast channel sky

780
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,580
techniques the anti vague ones a bit  chino

781
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,880
more real ok to amaze this

782
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,680
[Music] there

783
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,720
are so many of stalin technics

784
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,910
claudio before that I knew him however it

785
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:36,350
is an option globe ok it is a in

786
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,950
safari that so far has been created good

787
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:51,380
hands history and companions school ok at

788
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,860
first as first thing not  flight lovers let's

789
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:01,130
enlarge this album

790
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,310
ok then what obviously with making

791
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,050
fewer gifts what is public

792
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,200
the fire in the fantasy 4 dec

793
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,220
ok torn notes we see its

794
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,420
size 5200 then one with the

795
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,360
inscription from 5

796
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,480
which lasted a little fear of the league

797
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,420
ok a phase but this brief introduction

798
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,460
tringali dei we understand that it is done with that

799
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,710
it was created with mike stoller ok

800
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:42,670
being created with the panis goal what

801
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,590
we can do with this

802
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,900
suite command and ripa in goal we can

803
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,060
go all in the insulating field I

804
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:54,850
have  already said this contains ok and there

805
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,500
are various things in the world alfredo

806
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,750
mantica because he knows many things related to

807
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,470
photography

808
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,680
ok to the private citizen room

809
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,000
ok what you have to f  are then when the

810
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
command air we can extract the resources

811
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,660
inside in 11 types easily ok

812
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,400
then we go to the streets for

813
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,119
example

814
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,099
washed I tell them that we have read this

815
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,810
information we know it is called xp

816
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,380
lai look somewhere there is a

817
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:31,190
policy called  inspirational go it

818
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,140
should be ok

819
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,420
yes we want to reaffirm it we have a

820
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:46,480
time that is the most stop we go out ok

821
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,030
we have this file we see design 99

822
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:59,510
return vice data see what it is

823
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,120
there is a bit of strange stuff let's say

824
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,850
it makes the pair of world straw

825
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,160
which one puts there at the beginning

826
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,010
ok this all the air of being the

827
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,840
biblet python then a country ok

828
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,360
being a fly countries of

829
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,930
anti comrades trick what I love online dwarfs

830
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,780
tools or even the commander with

831
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:29,070
final countries ok is basically

832
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:34,890
we get  the code I do not make

833
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,590
another couple of top buyers goal.com and then

834
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,390
started the four outs with a

835
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,600
source then

836
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,290
of this web pride ok it is basically

837
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,970
a flash for us

838
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:52,480
ok here then  of the family and rings the

839
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,140
right he wants to make of the cones and what he

840
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,560
wants to be to have fished

841
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,660
ok obviously from the 5 among other things very

842
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,160
low also all the

843
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,620
dynamic complexity of this brand that

844
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,810
exactly banal and so the whole

845
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:14,640
belly lies the part of

846
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:20,319
we have godparents and therefore what it does

847
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,930
was worth seeing more double-check that it is

848
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,250
actually cultural and then

849
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,119
inter do everything to buy the various

850
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,819
files we have seen its president

851
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:38,059
how the nef we can strange

852
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:40,710
let's go to understand that one this has

853
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,540
generated with a pakistan falcon

854
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:48,630
let's go to  massacre the python barcode and

855
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:53,569
then let's get the source of evil

856
00:44:53,569 --> 00:45:00,240
ok so this is the minimum demo 4 and the

857
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,280
climbs and it is terrible social the females

858
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,589
rolled goalkeeper if you want then you can

859
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:11,910
do it then from the linux computer but

860
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,980
they are not look like 5 more real there  is a

861
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,849
trader who are both increased in

862
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,680
number and even a little bit of users

863
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,750
since in general they are much

864
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,670
simpler for those  minors

865
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,059
are generally simpler because even we say

866
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,170
the offensive part in istria so

867
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,020
etc. they are decidedly simpler and

868
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,190
from those

869
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,450
compared to the co lapped by wine we must

870
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,099
have rock you tool to be

871
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:41,670
prepared

872
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:45,060
we will understand internal games to analyze

873
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,560
this new type of threats many times

874
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,930
deep  for a main network written

875
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:58,380
wine although windows in general last

876
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,599
then they are for only one car in

877
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,200
general for intel under the display case for 208 it

878
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,470
primacy therefore in the bank and instead no

879
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,300
this there is a lot of typical pulls then

880
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,930
calculate the next that has an armed

881
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,630
world  because 100.000 tv friends can

882
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:16,990
be

883
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:22,170
for mix and then each one

884
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,690
slowed down 64 bit and so on

885
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,640
so even a little kidney of dominant species

886
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,660


887
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,460
ok but play once it was much more

888
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,550
complicated our support with the various

889
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,860
types of other books that he recorded for

890
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,290
ulysses with  the one determined by explains

891
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,590
even and gina lisa conquers more

892
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,400
for bigger and more newbies tanas I

893
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,800
hope this can  ò download given some

894
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,540
pill of knowledge already in the battery

895
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:56,500
want titles more stomach elf and linari and

896
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,610
undermine in general

897
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:04,990
[Music]

898
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,160
[Applause]

899
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,420
ok we

900
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,910
thank Mariano and if any of the

901
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,980
questions we could also have a second

902
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,470
micro 15 questions

903
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,400
[Music]

904
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,770
bye bye for  stem 15 years system and

905
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,930
therefore also john it is much more

906
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,720
complicated to play the part there is also

907
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,670
busy general more

908
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,490
power automation and you because the pretense

909
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,830
that you receive thousands

910
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,590
to say which are the malevolent to

911
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,400
turn a hold and not to try to

912
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,830
cheat  i.e. as fans disassembling

913
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,730
what then boy game

914
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,310
specially configured or onwards maybe even in

915
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,350
time cream file mode with the

916
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:07,110
internal paint then on the outside truss more

917
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,210
instrumentation changes with then those

918
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:10,350
more complicated

919
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:18,440
certainly to the questions

920
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:25,340
ok I would do another
