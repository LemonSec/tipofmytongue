1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,060
let's all do in the meantime thank you for being

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,310
here and thanks to the organizers for

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,450
this event i introduce myself i am this

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,269
here i am a master's student at ca

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,779
foscari in venice and in my free time i

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,689
like to waste time playing club football

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:22,140


8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,439
i.e hacking competitions

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,060
lately  I played with macaroni and

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,480
with the group from venice I mainly deal with

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,050
network the

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,489
defense infrastructure but also with something on the web

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,899
some of you know me for this and

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,960
others know me for the finals of 6 x

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,610
challenge of the point it

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,190
if you have played  final there was me and

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,230
another guy behind the

18
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,210
infrastructure so this more or

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,270
less what what

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,610
I would like to talk to you about today are the results

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,890
of graphic quotes of a bit of

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,420
research that we have done that can

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,899
be his farmol in the sense  that as we will see

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,399
in fact they are something quite

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,939
complicated and we do not try to

26
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,580
improve their use in practice so

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,900
what we will see in  short will be a

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,460
minimum of the big if you have no idea

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,000
what it means to far wall as we

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,890
configure the main to do it now

31
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,310
also during cdf and a couple of poole that

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,650
could be useful and timeless

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,140
something degradation a bit of theory a

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,580
bit of

35
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,600
of science between electrical

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,520
behind then

37
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,680
I guess you have already seen or have

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,260
already heard in the walls i pid and mons is

39
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,930
the command on linux to manage the

40
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,410
firewall which is part of the framework

41
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,490
also iter

42
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,050
how many of you have already tried to

43
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,200
use this type  of file on sep ok

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,220
then he is talking to the right audience

45
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,500
let's say that how it works that

46
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,810
we have chain tables and they are

47
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,729
called that they are collections of rules

48
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,650
each rule has a match that decides

49
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,910
in practice whether to apply a target to a

50
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,679
particular package a package that

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
enters my system if a

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,990
particular match for example brings it to the

53
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,750
destination r22 then I apply a

54
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,570
target that can be I accept it

55
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,880
they have it too there is ter  I undermine the connection

56
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,640
or translate it I ask somewhere else

57
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,160


58
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,459
in these lists of rules we have between you

59
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,370
live as the final point a de pol

60
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,340
policy that is if I have not specified

61
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,420
what is done with it by the fall policy and

62
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,360
or always too much, that is, I accept it

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,250
i don't care i work too much i refuse it

64
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,739
ok these are clearly

65
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,360
support a lot of let's say

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,920
low level operations i can jump

67
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,570
through to the other do of

68
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,840
non trivial processing and also support and also support

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,350
all barbolini stage

70
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,900
i can add  to these packets

71
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,640
a state and based on this state

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,730
execute relations rather than me

73
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,110
these actions can also be

74
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,340
network address translation

75
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,110
i.e. I can modify the fields of a

76
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,790
packet to send it in different directions

77
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,600


78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,190
i.e. I can tell if a

79
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,230
packet arrives on the  'abortion so much I do not

80
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,360
receive it I receive it from servers that

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,950
in the other network

82
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,170
these are more or less the k tickets

83
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,480
that and you see an example in b  ace to the

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,710
right of some horrible syntax that

85
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,480
haiti the wall on linux

86
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,100
in this case is accepting a

87
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,860
default policy in drop in input i.e. all

88
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,530
packets arriving and not

89
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,720
with me are there with no other rules

90
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,210
are found and I have only one  regulates

91
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,220
everything that happened enters

92
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,530
door 22 then leaves made from this

93
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,580
page do it so that only

94
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,100
connections enter only door 22 having

95
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,610
said this let's start with a case

96
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,490
study and what will practically remain

97
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,980
ranieri is to confer on the cold that

98
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,040
are the trapped CDs  tense for those of

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,540
you who have never heard the ct has done

100
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,000
with defense it is not essential that you understand

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,519
the actual operation in

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,440
detail but the important thing is that you understand

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,620
that there is a central system and a router

104
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,480
in the middle this router in the middle ago

105
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,580
so that each team that contains a

106
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,320
few to whom it serves will appear bilic and

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,120
must be carried out must be separated at the

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,620
network level from all the other teams

109
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,920
each team manages its own

110
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,990
therefore it lasts poles his server all

111
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,720
his laptops and his router every time

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,950
do what he likes

113
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,470
in his part the infrastructure is

114
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,350
what normally happens is that he

115
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,790
wants to segment the network

116
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,620
clearly having ours potentially

117
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,960
vulnerable in the network I do not want it close

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,070
to the  laptops

119
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,050
I don't want anything to jump from our

120
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,290
vulnerable laptop to a movie laptop

121
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,610
once I segment a network clearly

122
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,560
I have to apply a security policy

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
and my security policy mixed

124
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,970
with the really

125
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,940
working network policy is that the

126
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,800
team must be able to surf  on the internet

127
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,870
access the game I have to be able to receive

128
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,450
collections in the vulnerable machine

129
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,370
because it is a server it has to cover

130
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,970
services but I don't want the theater to be

131
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,040
vulnerable to be able to reach my

132
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,750
lan or that the vulnerable machine can

133
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,060
reconnect to the internet or

134
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,160
anything else to avoid pivot  thing or

135
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,300
stuff like that is ok as we proceed

136
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,190
at the firewall level with some  rules

137
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,390
I do not want to go into too much detail but

138
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,590
in practice what I am doing in

139
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,780
this configuration drop all the

140
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,590
connections and in the central part

141
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,860
accept only the ports on which today

142
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,430
service branches of my vulnerable perspective

143
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,160
the league always has forward that enters

144
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,610
minus the da  game minus bull the

145
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,460
machine operable with destination

146
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,190
online on tcp protocol on that port

147
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,350
then the certain if not everything else goes

148
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,230
into pole policy and is eliminated from the

149
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,170
important since this router

150
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,740
allows the team to access the internet

151
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,050
I have to do what normally  ago anto

152
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,390
home currency that is masquerating

153
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,640
that is, I must have seen we only have in

154
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,170
public and a lot of laptops

155
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,960
translate to all local addresses and

156
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,520
not just public address language all

157
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,250
good and already complicated but all good

158
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,080
the problem arises with oil add

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,850
further elements to the  my network

160
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,170
we assume that I want a reverse

161
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,260
proxy something more in front of the

162
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,740
services

163
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,530
then  I have to make sure that the

164
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,540
collections that would arrive at my

165
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,800
vulnerable machine no

166
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,260
longer arrive there but go directly to the goods

167
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,150
and this reverse proxy must be able to

168
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,220
turn the connection back to the vulnerable machine

169
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,570


170
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,220
here things get a lot more

171
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,400
complicated and I have highlighted here too

172
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
don't look just look at

173
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,390
what is happening at a high level

174
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,560
highlighted three at hockey you book

175
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,720
because in this case I have to do three

176
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,570
different things to have the same

177
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,340
behavior as before with universal

178
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,880


179
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,830
relief which means that I must first

180
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,130
apply network address translation

181
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,930
translate the conditions  that arrive to

182
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,740
direct them to proxy and accept the

183
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,470
health conditions i.e. the block at the

184
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,230
bottom translates to the address the

185
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,320
middle group accepts those connections that I

186
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,990
have translated after having translated them and the

187
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,570
block above makes sure that people

188
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,000
cannot connect directly to the rosi

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,710
without going through the network address

190
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,310
translation or three blocks is  quite

191
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,370
complicated and especially if you see it is

192
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,050
quite not never as configuration

193
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,730
that I have to remember where I apply things

194
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,010
what I have to accept I have to put the

195
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,960
rules in front for it gets very

196
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,520
complicated very fast

197
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,570
and this is only a couple of centuries so

198
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,890
why it gets much more complicated

199
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,420
very fast

200
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,340
first of all  the rules are contest and

201
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,110


202
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,550
tablet based on an element in my

203
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,700
configuration or problems problems

204
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,810
different results

205
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,780
in this case lost n 2 ours with

206
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,900
source n 2 the third rule is

207
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,450
accepted if only if it does not connect to

208
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,150
death 80 because there is just above  a

209
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,090
rule that finds everything on port 80

210
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,159
clearly if this adjusts the photo

211
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,700
above I also accent port 80 this

212
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,220
thing bothers us because clearly

213
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,680
on very large configurations I

214
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,650
risk cutting myself elsewhere I mentioned

215
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,890
before in other filters are applied before

216
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,880


217
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,850
then or before  it modifies the packages and

218
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,720
then too much

219
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,940
which means see here an eg  unholy

220
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,700
of how packet processing works

221
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,000
inside linus carnets

222
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,280
the first node I highlighted is in the

223
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,670
app

224
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,220
the first song the second node is

225
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,870
the packet filters that are not

226
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,330
directed to do which means I have to

227
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,310
remember how it translated and  all the

228
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,020
following rules must

229
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,280
refer to that if I don't remember

230
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,530
the translation

231
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,740
I can be wrong mainly so

232
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,560
to make a summary the order matters and

233
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,600
the semantics of the rules change based

234
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,820
on where the omitted in the bulk since the

235
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,210
packets this makes things worse

236
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,550
especially because  normally the

237
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,070
configurations are not developed by

238
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,920
programmers who use towards

239
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,019
trolls or similar things they are developed

240
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:53,240
by system administration who are often very

241
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,870
late even

242
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,889
the same dolls modify the same dolls and several times

243
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,930
different people put their hands on

244
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,360
it we do not normally have a clear

245
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,920
free way that  his post is also going on

246
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,630
because I don't know if you have had a

247
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,440
chance

248
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,730
you have had  opportunity to talk to

249
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,579
someone you know who is asked

250
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,829
please opened door 22 for me close

251
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,839
door 22 and maybe another host

252
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:16,160
somewhere stops receiving

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,699
connections this is a problem a

254
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,199
problem that we have tried to

255
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,170
solve with a compiler  there

256
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,029
our to specify in a

257
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,699
declarative way the things we want and

258
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:31,910
make sure that a component this nixon

259
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,920
beyeler I do a translation

260
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,690
compiler canons there are

261
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,220
surely already heard a trick and

262
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,360
the firewall or the like but what

263
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,100
interests me about this is  what

264
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,510
distinguishes it is that my rules are lands

265
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,180
of the independent of the order and have a

266
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,500
theme that makes a theme I don't

267
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,750
have to use this word

268
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,490
in practice I read a rule and I know

269
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,660
exactly what happens

270
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,640
I don't have to look at the others what that

271
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,079
that I care about these

272
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,420
press rule case I don't know where it can

273
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,310
be means it can be that it knows where I at

274
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,880
a glance what is happening

275
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,860
this is indeed in among other things I don't have to

276
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,149
think about the ball and chain and

277
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:22,370
above all it uses let's say that it has in itself by

278
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,230
default it can be used with

279
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,149
modern security practices that is by

280
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:30,800
default it is too much all the collections and

281
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,780
I only accept those slippage

282
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,420
and that I  it allows in my

283
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,310
declarative configuration to know to

284
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,500
someone else anna gip a few and only

285
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,270
those I am sure that

286
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,890
they will actually be able to pass through the via

287
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,040
phage this open source tool and it is

288
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,050
available at this address be sure to have a

289
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,560
look at

290
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,340
the idea of this l  'idea of this tool and

291
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,810
therefore to simplify the maintenance

292
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,880
of the security policies you will

293
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,810
assume but rather and above all as

294
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,750
I said before

295
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,830


296
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,510
the rules that actually seem complicated at the beginning that

297
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,060
we can actually use only these four I

298
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,160
can accept a connection find

299
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,870
a connection that  however incitefully

300
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,600
found but there are cases in which I want

301
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,730
to explicitly apply a

302
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,160
translation c  'is a di nat then

303
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,230
modify the destination or apply

304
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,760
a translation of the source c

305
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,650
modify the subject address of the

306
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,780
packets as soon as they mass for diamonds

307
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,580
these last two examples if you have already

308
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,830
seen them are the first I have to open a

309
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,380
port health port forwarding the second

310
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,050
I must  to do I have to connect from a launch

311
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,930
to the internet masks as I

312
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,780
told you before only one step and above all

313
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,310
what happens I do not have to put more

314
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,780
rules in different points of the

315
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,110
configuration and not only this the

316
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,180
translation from these rules has been

317
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,950
formally verified so

318
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,900
everything you are  hunchbacks or the toga or the

319
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,090
guarantee that this is actually

320
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,560
what happens my throat

321
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,200
level at the level let's go on let's go on

322
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,800
because this is where the research project came in

323
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,110
I realized that

324
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,980
most of the

325
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,540
complication languages not only in the

326
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,550
client  more or less the

327
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,470
same problems and these problems

328
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,940
are configurations are very much  w

329
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,130
level we connect on we have

330
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,690
procedures inside firewalls very

331
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,170
strange things and above all

332
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,089
a packet outing determines which rules

333
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:30,529
will be applied

334
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:33,260
nat obviously complicates things

335
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,650
so it's a mess in all these

336
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,190
systems

337
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,990
what we have done and say let

338
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,089
's see what is there and  what do they have in common and if

339
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:42,620
we manage to assign them also because

340
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,960
normally I don't want to tell the

341
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,290
3d tv system because we have 10,000

342
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,700
configuration lines to describe it

343
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,130
tour do what you do to

344
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,570
register it is better never will

345
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,650
so the idea is  to take all these

346
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,290
different firewall systems look for

347
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,779
the astrals and be able to think about the

348
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,630
reasoning above so as to give these

349
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,360
system administrators an idea of

350
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,589
what is happening without them

351
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:11,630
actually knowing how to read the

352
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,880
code or without them studying the

353
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,790
continuation for  weeks what we

354
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,950
do and then show a table

355
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,820
that says this speaks with this with

356
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,830
these transforms  actions in this case

357
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,020
we have an internal network that to talk

358
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,779
to all the os on port as much and 44

359
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,610
is masked by the address has

360
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,449
become this ex tt or web server

361
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,610
which to be reached with

362
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,629
destination ex tipi is translated into the

363
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:43,819
internal address of the web server

364
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:49,100
of the  66 on the relative ports this

365
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,399
gives us a vision let's say the same

366
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,930
declarative vision we had with the

367
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,610
previous rules without actually

368
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,439
writing the configuration more

369
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,499
simply I point a tool to the

370
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,449
configuration said tells me this is

371
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:04,970
what happens it is very convenient very

372
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,860
convenient especially because a  once

373
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,569
I have this specific declarative I can

374
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:09,170
ask myself questions

375
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,129
I can say that in a twin dancer they

376
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,339
can talk to the ass.to and yes or no

377
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,499
as translated etcetera etcetera

378
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:19,699
with the interesting we can

379
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:23,379
do is if I have more configurations

380
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:26,240
imagine that I have to  make a policy I

381
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,790
'm sure that after the change the

382
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,519
expected behavior is what I wanted

383
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,480
actually having with this modification

384
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
have a declarative specification that

385
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,809
lawfully to think about this type

386
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,730
of questions and ask and that slow

387
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,889
implication and differences between different policies

388
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:45,529
clearly also having this

389
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,509
configuration we have seen it before I

390
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,180
can resume everything and and do the

391
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,600
translation back to the file  starting

392
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,829
but not only

393
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,720
at all because we suppose so

394
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,339
I can take an inimitable firewall

395
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:01,309
we put and translate in bf because I

396
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:03,529
change the high dynos server in via

397
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,319
cellini or for a

398
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,360
very complex breakfast point in you are wrong I do not

399
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,660
like that mud the layer and  I consider it

400
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,759
a sales so I can replace in

401
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,959
network business

402
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,230
maybe obsolete maybe that I don't like

403
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,449
with

404
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:23,019
that they prefer to keep this too

405
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,629
is a tool available open source and that

406
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:27,519
can be used in practice and not

407
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,339
only can be used but let's say we

408
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,109
use these tools for  continue

409
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:33,970
our networks our department is

410
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,919
configured with min  imis and

411
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,399
we have used this tool on several occasions to

412
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,749
evaluate configurations that it could not

413
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,660
produce or that we could not rewrite

414
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,108
from scratch.We

415
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,970
take a second of our case

416
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,239
study and let's try to apply

417
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:54,279
this idea what we now have is

418
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,049
a change of perspective.  I am

419
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,850
more on the team side I am on the part

420
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,129
of the organization or a configuration

421
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:02,919
of two about 250 lines is not a

422
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,859
lot but it is a good country paul or three

423
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,409
teams connected to the central fight and

424
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,148
I want to know everything he does

425
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:13,209
let's put the titan as I can know they

426
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,260
can  be it in all the

427
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,519
metal rules the revelations and a gym

428
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,500
or ask my tool to summarize

429
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,569
the please all the packages in for

430
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,429
words of my wife yes where

431
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,639
smiling internally and this result

432
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:33,190
is a bit of a line but if you look

433
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,630
carefully I can first  block

434
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,190
practically use thing towards the

435
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,269
manager is that is let's say the game

436
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:46,510
server of this cdf and first three rules

437
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,240
from mine  team 3 if I want to connect to the

438
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,850
t1 t2 out in three my

439
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,250
source address changes with the address of the

440
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,679
believed attached these yes the details

441
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,419
of this are if you don't have bigger

442
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:03,549
on cdf that often many we like to

443
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,399
play in of vienna and to avoid  that the

444
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:07,870
teams know who two

445
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,419
connections are coming from the green server makes sure

446
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,240
to mask the address with its own in

447
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,940
this case we have in a simple way

448
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,309
an idea that is exactly what

449
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,289
happens in our policy what we

450
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:22,360
can also see is that the

451
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,450
port forwarding rules that would

452
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,130
apply to the external address

453
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,610
on port 80 and 443 can

454
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,080
also be applied from the internal network

455
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,450
this is a weird some files do not

456
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,970
in this configuration example it

457
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,389
happens

458
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:42,159
and you tell us go back second

459
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,889
to tell you that normally in  these cd r

460
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,529
I have two states in the network open network or

461
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:50,230
closed network that is when I do not

462
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,279
want me

463
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,129
to clash between living beings I close to the

464
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,649
network they study  ano the vulnerabilities

465
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,600
that I count on them and then when

466
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,220
the network opens to them they will start part of the

467
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,529
attacks

468
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:03,820
how can I use this tool to understand

469
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,100
if I have closed that in the network because

470
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,779
obviously there is the risk that I ask

471
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,909
the launch networks then maybe berto the

472
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:13,629
teams  they shouldn't be in the car

473
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:15,879
they shouldn't be able to connect to

474
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:17,250
other teams they do the same

475
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,870
this is a problem so I can

476
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,769
take my tour or two inches

477
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,929
my original is the one in which he accuses the

478
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:27,820
network in which I have changed some rules

479
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,769
done  something for both of us to like the

480
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,409
difference of the same packages where

481
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:34,840
the source i tir equals team 3

482
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,669
fit and he tells me exactly that

483
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:37,720
all that

484
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,920
removed in this are those three rules

485
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,630
so at a glance my iv

486
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,130
that of having  closed the network in a bretto way it

487
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,950
is correct or removed only those

488
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,710
now let's see if I have some time

489
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,720
I could be there in a great way I would like

490
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,430
to tell you a little about the theory I would not want to

491
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,010
dwell too much  on the theory of

492
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,230
nigris in the sense that showing you the semantics of

493
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,270
tite balls show you how I can translate

494
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,670
in an intermediate language from

495
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,630
language intermediate between screams a to

496
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,160
language at another level perhaps boring

497
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,380
perhaps the most interesting part of the

498
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,850
theory and the theory behind it

499
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,680
this type of analysis which is called

500
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,610
tempo.se and it is mainly at a

501
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,630
glance this is the idea of the game

502
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,830
a policy written in my

503
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,680
target language the massacre in a

504
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,080
generic language this dynamic language

505
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,860
must ensure that it contains both  the

506
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,490
control issues on the page both all the

507
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,660
rules that were there in which his

508
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,110
original and what we do and

509
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,540
transform all this into a formula

510
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,370
and using travel group and in this case

511
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,560
a set of software to ask him

512
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,570
this formula for solutions

513
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,060
and if  yes what in this case of

514
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,830
crooked god of fi carlo and all the

515
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,270
behavior of the mud like a nice

516
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,590
dedicated who always tells me that he is

517
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,310
accepted and he is accepted with  me novel

518
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,230
other problems says years there has been so

519
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,570
so so bad obviously these

520
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,900
results I have to extract in a

521
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,430
crafty way if not terni

522
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,520
but in principle the output of the

523
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,680
kruger shot is exactly the semantics

524
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,870
of what hate clearly having

525
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,250
a formula that describes me a firewall

526
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,370
allows me to do a lot of

527
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,450
logical concrete analysis on this bathroom

528
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,410
I can take two formulas from there to ok

529
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,000
one ancient the other

530
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,980
which do you think means which

531
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,900
packets of the first are accepted in the

532
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,480
second or there are packets that  the first

533
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,370
certain and second does not accept and

534
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,660
clearly calculate the

535
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,370
difference as well so then I can build

536
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,320
arbitrarily long formulas of

537
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,140
different firewalls and ask the shot and

538
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,440
problem for a solution

539
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,780
the interesting thing about the part before

540
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,390
the tea will find is the fact that we have

541
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,280
this generic language that we

542
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,140
it allows to represent all all

543
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,270
most of the

544
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,930
existing file systems as having a language

545
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,570
disclaimers  that you see in the example in the

546
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,400
middle that allows me to specify the

547
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,140
actions exactly as he did unedited

548
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,190
balls and a diagram that represents me

549
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,930
everything in the control of what happens

550
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,190
inside the file

551
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,870
you see that the one of those who tables is

552
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,510
exaggeratedly complex in fact you

553
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,250
tables  it is one of the files that people

554
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,620
make them more what to do things obviously at the

555
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,840
cost of being very very complicated

556
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,950
to write

557
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,050
the thing also interesting that the

558
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,480
peer control in gaulle are very

559
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,520
different the Italians you see I don't

560
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,920
care to go into details but

561
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,350
just look at the form only the number of

562
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,930
nodes and where I can put rules nor

563
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,330
during the next packets in fact

564
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,940
each node contains one of these losers

565
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,410
which can obviously be empty

566
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,740
once I have translated

567
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,270
all my neale policy into a set

568
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,000
of these in quotes  things put in the right ways or

569
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,730
generic way of being able to think about it and

570
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,660
how I think about it I build this

571
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,970
formula by accusing infector are  the

572
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,340
dimensions of all the fields of a

573
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,590
package therefore admirable represents the

574
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,660
package with a suit that is a set

575
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,450
of these in terms of fixed length I

576
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,640
build rules by visiting my graph

577
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,690
and I apply an algorithm to extract

578
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,610
the solutions the solutions are in this

579
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,160
form here they come  you call many fumes in

580
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,920
literature because they are actually

581
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,890
sets of straps mainly I can

582
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,580
have for example below this

583
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,320
represents all the possible packets

584
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,560
that have destination or address 10 2

585
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,900
15 or range 10 01 all subnet

586
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,370
and port o 22 44 3 therefore c  'it is a way of

587
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,310
extracting this type of representation from a formula

588
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,380
then I can

589
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,770
simply show it to the user and think about it

590
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:22,570
first I would like to leave you some

591
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,510
right references for the two articles

592
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,710
is a tool that are available immediately

593
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,460
balls and finished much sooner than

594
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:42,080
I thought if  you have any questions to come

595
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,529
[Applause]
