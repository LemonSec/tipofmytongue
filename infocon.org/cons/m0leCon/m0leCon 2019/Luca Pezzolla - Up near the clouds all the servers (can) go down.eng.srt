1
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,610
so hello everyone thanks for

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,820
still being here and I think he was probably

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,880
a little tired so I will try to give you

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,359
a blog

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,359
today we talk about security and

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,789
security in the cloud

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,160
the idea was to give you some ideas and

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,340
stimuli to deepen for those of you

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,800
in short, it begins in this

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,770
period to approach the world of work

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,800
all part of security on the cloud out of

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,620
curiosity then ends you announce

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,430
at least one application project in an

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,170


15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,079
ap computing platform in a few hands raised so I would say that

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,000
the public is right then everything starts

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,090
from  internet internet as it was from its

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,690
inception simply when

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,439
someone wanted to host an

20
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,869
online service in a porn area bought a

21
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,270
server connected it to the internet

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,689
in this way access is provided to its users

23
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,520
over time this mechanism

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
this distribution logic  that

25
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,369
the vendors have also used in saying I

26
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,439
give you a 2gb ram server

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,080
we are no longer proved to be sufficient

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,880
for this pe  because the internet has become a

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,759
place to sell where to make

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,140
disney grow when the business

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,340
tends to grow it will need more

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,340
resources it will need

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,340
different characteristics and obviously keeping up

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,850
with new technologies by spending all

35
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,680
private dedicated infrastructure is not

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,399
a viable path this is how it is

37
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,000
born this is how he brought the golden point

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,240


39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,158
[Music]

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,228
[Music]

41
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:28,470
[Music]

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,949
[Music]

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,230
and we arrive at the new paradigm what has

44
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,670
changed nothing

45
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,230
the servers are still the same

46
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,420
simply someone else I found

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,900
in order to make money

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,790
I guess  that all of you talk about the cloud

49
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,360
also in a technical way but in fact

50
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,220
what we are facing

51
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,160
especially as regards the

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,489
main players are companies that for

53
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,190
their internal needs must have a

54
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,940
large cast between hardware and have

55
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,400
started in the first period of the cloud  to

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,230
experiment with this common then to

57
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,110
be able to exploit as much as possible

58
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,120
their computational resources too  in the

59
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,640
moments of unloading we say about their

60
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,370
systems and then actually about a trend

61
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,110
friends so big that at this

62
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,900
moment more than 90 per cent of

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,140
digital companies ring global to a

64
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,450
public or private cloud system

65
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,459
what is simple cloud computing

66
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,269
simple I take resources on  demand and

67
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,090
pay based on what boss that

68
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,860
very simple system

69
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,700
the business is given by a lot of services we

70
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,880
click daily what they have

71
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,740
built around us in the rite to the provider

72
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,200
and I will focus mainly on sound

73
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,060
only the service what I address

74
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,340
in my community have created a

75
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,070
galaxy of more or less managed services

76
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,820
to help those who had

77
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,680
computational needs need to create

78
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,230
an infrastructure that was scalable and

79
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,510
maintainable over time simplify

80
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,670
your work and therefore have created different

81
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,130
categories of services from the

82
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,990
application part security the

83
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,680
storage part all designed to help  in 20

84
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,919
obviously more managed functionalities

85
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,900
also means but  ggior cost at the

86
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,900
right level what changes between the various

87
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,610
models that are used

88
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,680
within the 100 minutes

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,320
this is the classic model in which

90
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,350
companies had to manage all of

91
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,060
their hardware infrastructure, then

92
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,070
from networking to

93
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,230
application every aspect had to be

94
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,680
taken care of.  internal level,

95
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,290
let's say the three ways of distributing

96
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,360
cloud services that are most widespread are

97
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,710
the marketing of the infrastructure part,

98
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,740
then simply the

99
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,080
lowest part of networking up to the

100
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,250
virtualization of the systems the

101
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,570
marketing of ibla con service

102
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,919
in which the user must deal with

103
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,530
only of the application data or

104
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,750
to put back its own software as a

105
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,910
service for which you for example google

106
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,270
drive pay if you use the stroke work

107
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,970
pay me monthly and you have a

108
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,890
software service without worrying

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,680
obviously there must be a limitation

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,960
us when we cynics go  to

111
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,000
move on some hardware that  it is not

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,870
ours

113
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,030
we must understand where the threshold between

114
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,830
what is our responsibility is

115
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,540
what the producer guarantees us

116
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,249
obviously there are small

117
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,139
renzi among the various I found it lermani for

118
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,669
if they adopt the model of

119
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,439
shared responsibility then

120
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,969
define some elements that are

121
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:07,319
guaranteed by the service

122
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,469
tend to be the property that is

123
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,109
best guaranteed by the providers and the

124
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,629
availability of data because having a

125
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:16,469
large amount of computational resources they

126
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:18,599
can

127
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,969
actually afford to guarantee that

128
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:25,049
type of guarantee and in addition a further

129
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:27,179
step forward to show how to

130
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,479
improve their reliability

131
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,519
using the  cloud concept that

132
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,829
leads you to have not the single

133
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,049
server floor point of your company

134
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:38,699
connected to hunan

135
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,360
but rather one in your area and offline

136
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,309
being on the cloud on the public cloud

137
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:46,409
in particular allows you very

138
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,809
easily to be able to guarantee an

139
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:54,269
uptime of almost 100 the ceo  of amazon

140
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:56,759
web services talking about  cloud said

141
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,059
that the election needs many

142
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:03,179
experiments and to be able to survive the

143
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:04,709
collateral damage the failed experiments

144
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:05,669


145
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,439
obviously not for amazon web services

146
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,779
in fact to give a managed service as

147
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,699
we see that cloud providers implies being

148
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,969
able to tell their customers that to

149
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,369
use them nothing more  sure never

150
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:23,369
really true not always what

151
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:27,149
actually happens is that frame

152
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,649
computing is not the definitive solution

153
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,159
but must always be adapted to the

154
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,429
needs of the partner companies

155
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:37,409
in which you go to interface and

156
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,629
above all it requires expertise,

157
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,360
experience and I have chosen to bring  here

158
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,219
this topic above all because I

159
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:46,009
have deepened these issues

160
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,680
on a personal level in my experience

161
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,050
coming to realize that here some

162
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,090
technicians talk very little about cloud compared

163
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,490
to outside cloud and it seemed

164
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,190
right to tell well a little in order

165
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,860
to create new stimuli the alleged

166
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,600
I wanted to focus on is the

167
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,150
networking part  that fake cloud services and

168
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,190
very and very developed

169
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,650
amazon web services talks about team

170
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,050
get loud then press a little idea of the

171
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,080
private cloud the use the machines I

172
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,630
manage the infrastructure so it is

173
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,330
possible from the point of view of a

174
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,830
customer who uses a cloud service to

175
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,958
go  to define a real

176
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,130
derno network plus subnet obviously racer

177
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,289
available information on what are the

178
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,770
best ways to go and build

179
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,470
this infrastructure

180
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,360
if you want to deepen these aspects I

181
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,399
suggest you read the white paper and

182
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,920
services provides flu the different

183
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,870
topics are very detailed

184
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,870
allow  to also understand what are the

185
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,130
various strategies that have been adopted

186
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,630
over the years to solve

187
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,880
problems with within

188
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,670
our network we have more usual

189
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,279
milk availability zone and the concept that

190
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,060
allows the public cloud to

191
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,450
increase security the availability sorry

192
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,890
and their systems

193
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,160
and what that means for each data

194
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,750
center  placed in different place in the world

195
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:33,329
for example i dont know ireland to say no to

196
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:38,010
a motorcycle in ireland that three zone knot

197
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,819
of available

198
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,509
so there are three stages of styles which

199
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:44,359
placed in different places which have

200
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:47,220
different risk factors in the best

201
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,100
use at seismic risk  the other does not

202
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,079
and you have the possibility to

203
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:54,739
distribute your infrastructure and

204
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:57,269
balance the load of users

205
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,419
between various components while the

206
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:02,759
online on areas of funds from different or

207
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,709
even on different regions and this

208
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:08,189
potentially means to the minimum

209
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:10,799
given this management  of the network

210
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,779
obviously also allows me to seem to be

211
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,660
warning you can do it through

212
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,079
networks the clc services or among the

213
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,239
executed along the network yesterday is

214
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,019
in itself therefore represent a

215
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:29,089
global firewall at the level of having ability zone

216
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:31,649
while the bt group sites are

217
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,269
applied directly  on the single

218
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,449
instance having more control what

219
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:37,949
happens in reality is that these

220
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:40,559
tools are sure  nte simplify

221
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,139
the work of each of us

222
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,649
in giving areas to structures must

223
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,089
be used in the right way in

224
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,029
this is not trivial capital one 106

225
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,119
million users exposed exposed for

226
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,899
a miss configuration udine jon

227
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,369
hassell misconfigured service a machine

228
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:02,600
in a day the  relationship entered

229
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,769
106 million users scaling from the

230
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,339
computational point of view of c2 and the

231
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,970
computing service and have

232
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,609
more basic service among the various computing services is

233
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:20,970
one of the most

234
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,979
interesting skills of this service and the

235
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:25,589
possibility of being able to grow and  reduce

236
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,689
the number of instances

237
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,759
this means that for example i can

238
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,149
distribute the trap load instances of the

239
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,369
same madness or even different small ones

240
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:38,039
placed in different places and i can

241
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,440
also configure

242
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,110
to grow slowly in one

243
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,930
distances based on the data

244
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,320
visiting india now so  for example if my

245
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,940
application that depends

246
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,790
mainly on the cpi ends just

247
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,930
of si pos  are inserting a rule on the

248
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,280
gpu for automatically exceeding

249
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,820
a certain threshold will lead to an increase

250
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,850
in the room number of what, however,

251
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,550
if now we do not consider

252
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,120
introducing these dynamics

253
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,860
especially when there are

254
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,250
critical medical applications and the reduction of the

255
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,810
number of  May that happens exactly

256
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,880
from this only in are updated

257
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,450
so I or I have allocated several different

258
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,970
rooms of my software that are

259
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,710
potentially according to operations in

260
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,930
those operations is always 6 stop them

261
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,610
there are time periods or jobs that

262
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,290
I cannot afford to invite of

263
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,130
life

264
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,400
this is an aspect of the  basic disease of the

265
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,820
relationship with abi club but that it is worth

266
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,880
keeping a lot of storage in mind

267
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,050
obviously as I said before the

268
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,980
computational part is generally

269
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,140
stateless just to allow this

270
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,120
growth reduction so you cannot

271
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,840
save the files in the same place where

272
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,030
pathetically run your code

273
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,860
this live of  motive sense will have to

274
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,730
dis  in doing a lot of sound

275
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,470
on web services you also have the

276
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,420
possibility of going to configure

277
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,530
deriu set

278
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,310
in particular of the banks rest

279
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,930
for access through the identity access

280
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,850
service or of the ninis clash anxieties

281
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,610
that allow you to select if there

282
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,170
should be

283
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,820
globally accessible objects

284
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,420
terminated the operators in

285
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,850
reality however also here it is very

286
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,470
very common especially the right

287
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,750
Roman configurations two

288
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,230
unsafe configurations means considering that

289
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,019
they train service is at heart at

290
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,589
12 therefore it is not part of that perimeter

291
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:52,540
directly controllable by  you

292
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,649
through the filing activity it

293
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:58,360
happens that the budget and if among the

294
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,790
figured but exposes everything that

295
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,000
came inside to who knows who depending

296
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,100
on the verizon configuration the

297
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,550
telephone operator has found 14 million

298
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,910
users with data exposed because  he

299
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,639
forgot pushy extremes and it happens

300
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,079
happens more often than you think

301
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,019
others  o very interesting case derives from

302
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,540
this activity every management of

303
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,810
the keys the cryptographic keys as

304
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,089
image blown generally it is a good

305
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:33,430
idea not to keep them inside your

306
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,500
lashawn system checks as

307
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,529
much as possible try to keep them safe

308
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:43,240
the weight beyond votes to an internal  which

309
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,890
can be safe but obviously for

310
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,120
exports

311
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,890
amazon web services has built this

312
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,670
kms service of matri system that

313
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,209
allows you to pass a

314
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:57,699
cryptographic key to the algorithm without

315
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:00,190
having to physically save it by exploiting

316
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,290
the wounds are made available

317
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,660
by the

318
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,510
services all very nice if it were not  that the

319
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,510
master key of campers put at 31 a

320
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,029
saved on this brief and saves it in the

321
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,620
bulletin board and then what

322
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,470
happened was that at a certain point

323
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,329
they found themselves with glasses and readers who

324
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:25,660
follow us and I wanted to resume a

325
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,279
concept

326
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:37,920
perhaps not  I paused ok then

327
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,810
shared responsibility shared responsibility

328
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:46,660
for you what does it mean  ifica for

329
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,360
amazon means that they are

330
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,399
responsible for the hardware part they are

331
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,509
responsible for updating keep

332
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:58,660
the part of their competence safe

333
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,610
but keep in mind

334
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,899
everything you do within the

335
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,600
platform manually or

336
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,910
using lady ai in these services they

337
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,790
create to allow me to  automate

338
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,860
the procedures and this too I

339
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,499
suggest you do some in-depth information about

340
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:14,949
infrastructures cod

341
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:16,930
we never talk about it here at the polytechnic it is

342
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,160
really an interesting topic I can

343
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,540
automate the creation of my

344
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,309
network infrastructure anywhere in the

345
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:27,639
world maybe even more cloud providers in

346
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,829
an absolutely automatic way yes

347
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:32,740
I can but  I have to study how to do it

348
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,620
so my invitation is to deepen

349
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,639
these issues

350
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,399
if you have any questions curiosity goes bards are at

351
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,610
your disposal and thanks for

352
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,220
your attention and word of mouth nicosia

353
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,849
[Music]

354
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,530
in this is an interesting question

355
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:21,000
obviously to pull cloud provider

356
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,099
bulbs of you are fantastic  dedicated

357
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,060
eu  wait we must trust

358
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,200
I know it is a bit to say but it is

359
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
objectively and business that is at this

360
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,300
moment amazon earns more from

361
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,060
the services side than from the commerce marbles

362
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,680
I let you imagine what

363
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,110
the margins may be and it is clear that

364
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,720
especially on managed services therefore

365
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,690
for example now they have in the shadows of a

366
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,610
cut, however, on the game bay waste and

367
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,680
also provides the solutions the water base

368
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,380
service whose shop that allocates your

369
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,750
machines but provides you with many

370
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,090
everything he is who also manages the backup

371
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,620
of manages the wheel and north  a series

372
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,110
of comforts that allow us to make

373
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,420
our development faster and

374
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,670
potentially have solutions

375
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,220
and it is clear that we need to understand you will not have to be

376
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,430
in the cell and how much

377
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,510
those who are not there but are not afraid will move together

378
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,360
[Applause]

379
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
[Music]

380
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,539
