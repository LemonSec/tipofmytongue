1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,689
hello everyone I am maternal

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:09,809
I come here to present data breach will be addressed

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,400
with a link let's say to the

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,980
criminal groups that have been detected

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,869
carrying out some of the crisp prince traits

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,240
in recent years and what are

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,180
then the tactics and techniques to finally

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,140
use these groups but shore

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,449
intentioned and as we say they

10
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,410
can be analyzed in order

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,129
for companies to study and maybe emulate

12
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,070
these methodologies in a controlled environment

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,340


14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,110
I am as our

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,530
senior manager of savori cybersecurity must be

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,090
unfortunately he had the commitment will come later

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,530


18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,539
I am in fact  gray cup consultant

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,039
I deal with cyber

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,199
security activities both from a technical point of view

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,600
and also from a technical point of view

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,010
let's say we do

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,950
pet shop activities testing incomes

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,590
ming campaigns buildings anything else

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,920
and today we also bring you

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,360
ours  experiences let's say what

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,790
a little we have seen in the during

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,479
our works first

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,920
of all an introduction on the

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,850
actress author is cataloged as an

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,640
IT security incident or through

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,400
which information is filtered

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,930
which may be

34
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,729
sensitive information or

35
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,070
confidential data which should be protected

36
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,170
in a somewhat slow way

37
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,170
this  it can happen in different ways

38
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,090
obviously there can be let's say a

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,220
former western filtration in which

40
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,939
an employee of a company forgets

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,770
maybe and little ones hotel that is not

42
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,899
correctly encrypted for some time

43
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,130
therefore to the data

44
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,159
for all stability of all can be

45
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,189
carried out various  physical theft

46
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,539
cannot be stolen cell phones that

47
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:09,220
may contain access to

48
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,430
email data and other types of data in 3d

49
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,890
sider threat which is one of the latest

50
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,540
threats that have been cataloged in

51
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,550
recent years that are precisely dependent

52
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,390
at an early age end and that for  mac

53
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,349
discontent for revenge or for other

54
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,280
reasons do cause damage towards  to

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,049
your company

56
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,000
instead from where we will focus

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,250
today

58
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,190
unauthorized access or when

59
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,280
someone does it this land that

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,590
is frequently found data using

61
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,799
computer racing techniques

62
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:57,430
before moving on to the myth,

63
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,019
careful sweets who want both

64
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:01,630
rooms but can  to show a port of the

65
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,819
last few years what we are

66
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,670
talking about numbers that these are of the

67
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,459
latin rear made about 100 thousand

68
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,060
incidents concerning vibrata beach and

69
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,010
we can already see that most

70
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,670
of the tactics used to exfiltrate

71
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,220
tactics are linked to

72
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,819
cyber attacks generally already  over 50 and

73
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:29,170
100 not linked to the album immediate and

74
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:36,329
finished in such a way then

75
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,010
many of these authors intervene among other things one

76
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,260
of the biggest problems is not only

77
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,019
breathing the data that many times

78
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,000
companies do not realize the

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,299
violation has occurred in

80
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,540
we also have short times in Italian cases in which

81
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,670
financial institutions have been

82
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,709
subjected to

83
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,230
We are also talking about the significant losses in the hundreds and hundreds

84
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,190
of billions.

85
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,680


86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,640


87
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,770


88
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,810


89
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,970


90
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,529


91
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:24,640
all confidential company emails have been published between

92
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,960
[Applause]

93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,970
who is behind these notables there is

94
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,160
generally obviously they may be

95
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,010
people who move on their

96
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,060
own for a purpose that can be

97
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,410
activism as they say now or

98
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,570
bitten by ideals that can be

99
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:53,860
ideal politicians maybe linked

100
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,310
to

101
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,580
the economy others most of the good part of the

102
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,030
wikis effect these attacks are

103
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,520
organized criminal groups

104
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,510
generally they are made by people

105
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,180
outside the companies and are in fact

106
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,450
carried out by groups that generally do they

107
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,270
are supported by governments have open

108
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,520
the advanced resources  time

109
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,290
available is highly motivated

110
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:31,820
especially in numerical terms  it is

111
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
more about the amount of data and filtered

112
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,320
not so much on the impact they may have had

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,740
on the reputation or on the business

114
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,480
sections such we see that we have for

115
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,760
example the first place conquered by the

116
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,120
avs that for 2013 2014 and

117
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,770
3 billion cities were violated  of accounts

118
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,100
we are going to go down even up to the

119
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,620
attack that Sony will suffer in 2011 in which

120
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,919
among other things the so-called hackers who

121
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,340
had violated

122
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,730
the company also had

123
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,930
a destruction of the servers

124
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,180
that had covered the return of data for a long time

125
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,830
in short, they

126
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,050
only realized it a posteriori

127
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,610
and so on in a sea of water over the

128
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,490
years we have seen that there are a

129
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,120
single attack can lead to damage

130
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,400
a devastating impact towards from tn

131
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,600
especially in terms of irritation

132
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,700
and it is precisely for this reason  that in

133
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,870
recent years a special law has been regulated

134
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,440
that the ph agi to

135
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,440
protect the citizen people against

136
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,990
this and against the game of

137
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,700
sensitive data here  ndo it is not their fault

138
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,750
when now we want to take a

139
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,280
photograph on

140
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,310
persistent threat groups or they are

141
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,400
identified for how groups

142
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,890
generally rent criminal organizations

143
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:18,620
that have large funding maybe

144
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,650
our skills are generally high

145
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,639
supported precisely the governments to do

146
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,539
so much towards enemy governments for

147
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,960
political reasons  economic if maybe they were not necessarily

148
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,479
on the direct lines to kami govern

149
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,070
this and more but also a lot of

150
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,919
the bank will certainly return to

151
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,490
the economy of that country which in the period

152
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,020
of these groups are

153
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,130
generally distributed throughout the world

154
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,380
we could also present some of

155
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,870
the most famous ones

156
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,000
we have for example generally to

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,690
place you some code names as they

158
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,220
are recognized

159
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,000
identified let's say these groups

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,530
obviously do not leave a signature on a

161
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,540
business card when they reflect

162
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,310
these attacks but generally they are

163
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,480
let's say they use

164
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,610
quite similar tactics and methodologies between d

165
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,090
their or tools used let's say in

166
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,660
a fairly common way and when

167
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,030
these methodologies are detected on

168
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,220
multiple targets maybe they are anti-Semitic than

169
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,780
them and that maybe for the purposes of groups they can

170
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,360
be motivated by financial interests

171
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,589
other ideological reasons

172
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,020
are divided

173
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,969
these are the code names some for

174
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,550
for example his group are

175
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,230
associated with the North Korean government of fans

176
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,750
from the Chinese government not of wait was an

177
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,310
Iranian group because we say they are

178
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,080
we believe it is thought that they are

179
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,380
associated with governments because their

180
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,080
capabilities and their we say attack power are

181
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,100
not  it is common and it is not let's say they

182
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,640
don't have nor a level that can be

183
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,440
reached with conventional resources

184
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,360
always there must necessarily be

185
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,360
supported in some way

186
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,130
then these groups maybe even

187
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,870
different they also have ten twenty thirty

188
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,680
forty components that alternate

189
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,390
between  them and continue to carry the attack

190
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,640
24 hours a day at the company so

191
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,070
while mag  ari the company works

192
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,310
only in hardware mino raiola operational

193
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,810
these do not sleep they do not eat

194
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,040
rather because they are strongly

195
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,449
motivated to achieve the goal

196
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,560
from the study of these groups to buildings

197
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,690
made

198
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:06,470
for even normal blood marking

199
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,080
to identify the tactics and

200
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,700
methodologies used by  these groups

201
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,260
for when a company undergoes a

202
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,660
search tab I received the so-called blue team

203
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,780
that the group dedicated to the defense of the

204
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,110
company when the moment that has to

205
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,790
communicate what is coming there was a

206
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,410
moment in difficulty in which each

207
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,300
used by its own terminology and

208
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,230
here when we talked to each other we give

209
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,570
reports in our Italian case it

210
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,270
certainly has national rather than other bodies

211
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,400
that centralize perhaps

212
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,270
reports of attacks in progress to

213
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,130
recommend countermeasures however

214
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,800
go and spread news because

215
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,380
sharing news is a

216
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,740
strength of the church if a  earth suffers

217
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,200
an attack that maybe a tired one  who is not a

218
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,120
teacher seen in the world and does not

219
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,490
communicate it all the others may be

220
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,710
at risk because they will not be able to

221
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,490
protect themselves from donations yes of

222
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,510
these groups the technologies was the

223
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,820
machine gun that is a non-profit organization

224
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,520
that aims to increase

225
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,530
security  in our world from the IT point of

226
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,710
view and in general also

227
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,120
from the infrastructural point of view and

228
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,480
anything else that operates the various

229
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,830
health sectors variation always security has

230
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,380
developed an open source

231
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,100
framework called attack and which goes to study and

232
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,529
formalize the

233
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,329
methodologies  techniques used by these criminal groups

234
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,040


235
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,649
therefore we no longer speak from a

236
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:53,329
didactic point of view of

237
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:56,249
hypothetically possible attacks but we are talking

238
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,709
about attacks that have actually been

239
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,279
seen on the web which has

240
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,639
probably caused damage and which

241
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,509
therefore we say have been precisely

242
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:12,120
standardized in  nomenclature terms in

243
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,579
terms of techniques and attacks are and

244
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,019
have created this framework that

245
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,870
it also associates in addition to defining what

246
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,120
are the strategies and tactics of the social

247
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,949
whole criminal group, a company being able to

248
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:31,040
see could keep the first bank

249
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:39,410
of rome as my knowledge that there are

250
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,089
criminals who in that period are

251
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,649
particularly active on the

252
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,079
financial sector on the European sector by going

253
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,029
to  studying the methodologies of those groups they

254
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:50,759
can reproduce with their prey teams

255
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,860
that are instead of the blue

256
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,920
team of groups that make files

257
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,050
insecurity the attacks on companies remain in

258
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,459
a controlled manner

259
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:03,449
and then eventually there could

260
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,250
be killing so-called compounds so

261
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,959
there is a collaboration  reciprocal between the

262
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,949
two teams the team and have a goal of

263
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:15,360
a common by helping the exchange of

264
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,839
communications such as every limit attack

265
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,490
which we bring a summary the phases that

266
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,100
are reported f work obviously

267
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,679
also covers the aside and re and

268
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:31,079
things were the sanction  equal to the

269
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,519
target this can happen in fact

270
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,279
criminal groups and anyone in a  typical

271
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,610
playstation test

272
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,860
that took place with following we are able to

273
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,529
put the consolidated methodology

274
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:52,339
before going to try let's say head

275
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:55,690
down any attack

276
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,820
generally made think about it they

277
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,410
try to reopen as much information as

278
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,130
possible in this case we no

279
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,230
longer speak only of information

280
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,320
about infrastructures  digital or

281
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,240
private so much to train us but

282
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,560
this information can also be

283
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,899
about the church and the

284
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,540
employees habits that in this

285
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,579
same email address can be

286
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:25,970
studied via kant social of the

287
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,230
company's steve profiles prepare a

288
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,220
targeted social network and in some

289
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,820
in fact, striking cases were in fact at the

290
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,079
time they were detected they were

291
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,470
studied there is that scotto that they are

292
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,839
these attackers have been let's say on the

293
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,140
sly for about three months they had entered the

294
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,440
company but have been listening

295
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,519
by reading the communications between

296
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,290
managing directors and them

297
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,800
secretaries coming up to send a

298
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,420
mail a single mail on a specific day

299
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,699
visiting practically the same way of

300
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:08,230
style postponing they use for theirs

301
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,449
asking to make a bank transfer of

302
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:15,320
a certain amount samp I try to

303
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,649
do it quickly for reasons that

304
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,860
the gm has told us has served on duty

305
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,220
has not had  doubts went to make

306
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,810
this transfer the thing was discovered

307
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,610
only after three months in a casual way

308
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,470
because in front of an aperitif they

309
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,660
talked about the CEO

310
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,320
who was left let's say it decomposed by the fact that

311
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,579
he knew this thing

312
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,050
as we said the mit reality that uses

313
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,440
a unified language  in which the various

314
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,180
phases from which sell of landslides framework

315
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,840
are connected to certain techniques

316
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,610
used by the attackers for example

317
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,410
for the phase finally cesca nation what

318
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,950
I arrived I manage to get there

319
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,900


320
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,220
one of the things I intend to do is to

321
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,350
remain in ten for a user or with

322
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,590
quite low privileges and therefore

323
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,210
in the escalation privilege phase, for

324
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,920
example, are pa  ssate what are the

325
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,950
techniques used by criminal groups

326
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,740
and this can also be useful precisely

327
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,730
to communicate what happened in this

328
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,230
phase they used this technique

329
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,030
in the next phase

330
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,370
they won it from another if this can

331
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,840
also be useful to agree on

332
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,250
cahill scenarios  done with

333
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:45,580
companies because in the moment in which perhaps

334
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,680
a mind a company must know of a

335
00:16:49,680 --> 00:17:01,180
certain attack has suffered a

336
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,420
violation knowing how it was

337
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,450
carried out can be useful to try

338
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,150
to reproduce that scenario through

339
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,530
an external company through an

340
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,800
internal team and see your own  hypo degree of

341
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,380
resistance in front of this to this

342
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,349
methodology of this much pinned

343
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:24,599
we repeat that they can aim them

344
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,970
choose a target define what are

345
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,790
the priorities to those who want the

346
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,240
so-called jewels yet what is the

347
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,940
ultimate goal I want to achieve and

348
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,800
what is the  maybe the weakest point that

349
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,420
I can get there can maybe do it

350
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,790
through

351
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,240
informatic  the last stories using

352
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,610
social engineering techniques or

353
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,960
perhaps even physically going to

354
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,600
the target structure as many times

355
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,780
computer measures are adopted that

356
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,460
reach very high levels and physical

357
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,640
security is not given much importance

358
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,150
so maybe anyone wearing a

359
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,950
tie is allowed to pass

360
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,920
or with the  cleaning operator style

361
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,740
who through

362
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,500
social engineering techniques is

363
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,790
convinced to let's say

364
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,290
temporarily deliver his badge and

365
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,540
generally the operators these

366
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,950
police predators have access to

367
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,280
all the premises of the company,

368
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,580
among other things including the data centers and so

369
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,550
on that  ago by going to enter

370
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,320
directly within the company

371
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,120
you can connect with simple suspicions

372
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,980
here the aspect that reserves fall and

373
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,600
before a connection that is not

374
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
checked for perimeter protection parties

375
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,140
then with move let's say

376
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,310
create choose goods scenarios

377
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,480
agree one  scenario when companies

378
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,740
of r  iso restarts we want to do mario

379
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,670
complete path or from the genre I

380
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,280
am the life of being very strong rivals

381
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,220
of the greeting of being in general of

382
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,400
firewalls that are scary or

383
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,180
intrusion protection systems

384
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,190
configured correctly updated

385
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,860
but maybe there is no lack of action

386
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,140
in your it is snowing now  tenders and therefore

387
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,580
I do not detect what happens inside

388
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,550
the network but only the

389
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,090
incoming and outgoing traffic and therefore it may be

390
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,340
useful to do

391
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,250
internal tests in that case I have to

392
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,679
go out to propose at dawn to propose what

393
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,270
are the phases that generally in a

394
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,510
methodology  complete classic we start

395
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,940
from the scanning phase and likewise

396
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,730
information on the target until we

397
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,150
find precisely what the tar is and

398
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,350
let's say the service or the

399
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,250
weak shank of the chain in ours and in

400
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,740
these cases we generally agree

401
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,409
precisely the scenarios and the perimeter

402
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,820
as we say  of the purpose of

403
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,010
the activity the criminal groups do not have these

404
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,620
types of constraints do not worry  dull to

405
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,909
say I can not directly send

406
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:43,450
the thousand employees or this server

407
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,029
out of scope where they

408
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:56,770
absolutely want it is usually you

409
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,510
can make the first access

410
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,270
now in the company you can be but you have

411
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,730
tmz so we are not yet

412
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,130
inside  however we are approaching

413
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,840
the first thing you do

414
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,500
once you enter you want to stay

415
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,529
because maybe the attack must be carried

416
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:18,070
out during the week and then you

417
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:29,590
want to exist you know up to go to

418
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,720
raise your privileges in order to

419
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,750
then go and make

420
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,940
lateral movements  collection of information

421
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,159
once the eventual who never

422
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,020
intends has collected has mapped

423
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,380
let's say the available surface and

424
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,649
identified which data are

425
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:53,549
important for him can be

426
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,289
filtered in various ways one of the

427
00:21:58,289 --> 00:21:59,970
extraction methods that lately

428
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,389
we know to be among those that go

429
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,600
unnoticed are  extirpated data

430
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,139
through the quiri dns that one that the

431
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:11,279
kind of traffic it generates

432
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,610
venerable lament almost never made by

433
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,340
companies that is one because it is a

434
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,909
mode is huge 2 because no one is

435
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:23,869
expected to read qualified

436
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,980
information such as sensitive data

437
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,590
within these dns threads which

438
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,570
then point to servers controlled in the

439
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,789
attackers and which  therefore they are able to

440
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:35,009
transpose this information,

441
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:37,200
basically passing badly preserved

442
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,850
situation many other machines can be made by

443
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,269


444
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:45,029
continuing in a short drill down to

445
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:50,909
federal tv2 phases and atac starting precisely

446
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:53,850
from the say constance phase generally

447
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,909
you can do classic activities with

448
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:00,359
open source tools within

449
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:03,299
everyone's reach then scan  numbering of the

450
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,389
services on display but not only

451
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,609
maybe criminal wolves or indeed year

452
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:11,429
having our

453
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:13,289
financial resources available

454
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:18,899
by going on the web many a good

455
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,909

458
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:31,619

i  internal company not

460
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,470
severed and these web accesses are sold

461
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,320
to secondary that the target machine

462
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,509
which as such is more or less

463
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:45,059
important background of the type of access

464
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,879
that is this information is

465
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:59,100
sold to this bull 20 governments that

466
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,700
have

467
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,250
potentially limited budgets and  with a strong

468
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,860
motivation, nothing is enough to

469
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,419
perhaps ask to use

470
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:15,639
someone else's work but not only

471
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:19,250
link thing for example it is a unique source of

472
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,159
information for those who want to do

473
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,570
great hering information on people

474
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,730
because they can appreciate that they are

475
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,750
perhaps contacts of the person  who is

476
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,820
which are which under the trucks to

477
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,690
identify the only ones in sight then the

478
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,919
system of a company maybe cr martiti

479
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,059
is clear from the h department and in order for

480
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:42,919
you to decide which is the simplest target

481
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,960
if to stop the type of attack

482
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,000
once done  all the information

483
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,649
you need

484
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:56,179
you try the first first access to the

485
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:00,760
profession in the first three explains

486
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,529
bring back a  a series of techniques I use

487
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:07,130
that can range from attacks to web

488
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,409
applications with recognized expo up

489
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,850
to compromise through the

490
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,230
distribution of infected USB sticks and

491
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,620
in the company parking lot and are cases

492
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,760
that really happened

493
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,340
the employee who perhaps does not have

494
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,990
training from the point of  view of always

495
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:31,460
security has not been adequately

496
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,919
trained finds a key is something

497
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,279
that does

498
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:37,360
I want to see that it puts us which one attacks

499
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,919
at that point the attacker within

500
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,159
the network phishing or surface remels can be made

501
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,480
the difference

502
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,100
that remains buildings that generally  they have

503
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,840
a unique format and are sent to the ground

504
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,200
at all to a large series of

505
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,919
targets hoping that someone will

506
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,260
fall for them they had dellos for fish instead a

507
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,120
targeted attack in which

508
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,970
a detailed study of the target is carried out and

509
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,779


510
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,889
communications are sent that try to  be

511
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:12,190
as credible as possible in

512
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,999
order to induce the target

513
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,429
the victim  to click on a link or more

514
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:21,730
an attachment we have also seen

515
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,749
cases in which the attacker through the

516
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:27,879
boats is a good track a

517
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:30,549
communication with the target before

518
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,769
sending I tell you about the attachments to a

519
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:35,279
sort of mistrust

520
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:44,369
this in the common conception  about the

521
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,809
average person maybe who does not have these

522
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:49,749
types of knowledge does not

523
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:51,159
even want to think about it so when the

524
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,929
site responds to an email, he searches and

525
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:54,850
I am talking to a person talking

526
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,639
with an intention or with a

527
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:59,710
computer system a bit tomizawa automatons

528
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,759
traumatized a  once the

529
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,259
phase of the rigorous network compromise has been carried out,

530
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:12,759
this can be

531
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:15,119
done in various ways by

532
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,950
entering processes already active in the

533
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,860
system that have higher privileges

534
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,749
by passing the checks on the

535
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:26,129
extensions

536
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:28,419
if these have not been configured

537
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:30,850
correctly or  they are not robust enough they

538
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,200
can be written even if it

539
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,999
should be mentioned not addressed at the beginning

540
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:43,960
of the yes  lambert system and then going

541
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,759
to code at an almost binary level a

542
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,720
machine language of the codes that must be

543
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,159
targeted on the vulnerability because they

544
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,019
are written were davis

545
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:05,529
we now have thousands of

546
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:08,490
public source code

547
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,830
already known in life because

548
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,080
perhaps the systems

549
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,890
the target is generally more this

550
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,570
protected shower has already been passed if

551
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,460
they do a regular patch management

552
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,600
carry out a monet rabiti scan does not

553
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,380
lead to anything so they come you

554
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,990
have to go and look for something different

555
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,960
you have to think outside the box and

556
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,190
15 st there were also those who just

557
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,670
went through the weeks to  do

558
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,200
there must be neyrinck maybe in modern

559
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,350
exposed on the internet team company to

560
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,200
write but zero day and then enter which

561
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,120
was one of the examples I had done

562
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,540
are of Italian companies that had

563
00:28:54,540 --> 00:29:00,010
these tractions the massive once

564
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:05,290
done dj scale shaun you need to have

565
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:09,070
assistance from  stay the system wants to

566
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,740
go back later wants to have  the

567
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,510
possibility to train even after months

568
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,890
or wants to give someone else the opportunity

569
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,780
to access by reselling

570
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,570
that access through bitcoin payments

571
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,590
through all currencies black ridge

572
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:34,210
are anonymous persistence can be

573
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,930
made technical barriers that we go down

574
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,970
that does what surely because

575
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:45,310
I had arguments  advanced enough and in

576
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,110
any case there would be no phone to

577
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,810
discuss them in detail once

578
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:54,030
carried out from the insertion of the network and

579
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,290
having, let's say, the first

580
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:00,740
ten necessary to generally make

581
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:06,830
a land immediately on the tablet that makes the

582
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,710
lateral movement is called or

583
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,740
move inside the  network from one

584
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,090
host to another from one computer to another

585
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,630
from a server rim to the network to a server of

586
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,309
malto network

587
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:23,809
many times companies protect

588
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:25,640
their perimeter properly but do not

589
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,960
segregate the internal network

590
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,690
so once that maybe even for

591
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:36,980
example the requests  and yet it has

592
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,179
full access to the entire company

593
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,780
so this does not segregate  action

594
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,510
of the networks can create various problems

595
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,670
once a possible malicious person

596
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,490
is inside

597
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,720
this can be made of various

598
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,710
means to traffic are together

599
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,490
declares initials domain no

600
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,900
directory or going to intercept

601
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,059
maybe succeeds that are passed as

602
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:16,360
identifies but the user's session

603
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,020
through tools there are available on

604
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,690
operating systems kidneys towards others that

605
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,929
are used both by professionals

606
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:29,870
and the computer spice that if they are

607
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,840
used for this activity both by

608
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,610
people who do it

609
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,130
fraudulently or sign up system to

610
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,030
say on the times I can simply

611
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,720
customize a  depending on your

612
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,990
needs

613
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,929
a protocol that they are successful a

614
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:50,840
critical vulnerability on the rdp protocol

615
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,330
that the remote desktop connection

616
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,120
is launched quickly there are

617
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,559
thousands of elderly people who remain

618
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,200
saw a neck that is used

619
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,170
often and willingly rightly

620
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,610
independent does not want to connect  from a

621
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,320
terminal to a

622
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,560
possible server, it is used above all if

623
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,750
it is not a formula of the function and

624
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,640
therefore perhaps wants a graphical

625
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,270
interface once carried out at the

626
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,030
lateral moment for a time it is identified

627
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,350
which are the formations that it wants to

628
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:34,580
go to recover it passes to the

629
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:42,110
extraction phase  inserted between the slides but

630
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,640
generally it is something that is

631
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,610
carried out between the four people

632
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,420
when they are tight and the phase that

633
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,250
this so-called evasion of

634
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,170
the texture systems therefore once it has

635
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:57,470
arrived the system cannot fail to

636
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,000
start the vulnerabilities in

637
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,150
being  morning in china requests or so

638
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,690
on because anyone has a minimum

639
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,600
eye on that portion of the network to

640
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,340
see immediately that there is something

641
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,030
wrong

642
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,740
or maybe there are anti-viruses that

643
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,290
could block

644
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:20,890
our systems in my execution tomorrow

645
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,000
so there are  various techniques to

646
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,510
carry out

647
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,590
antivirus commission sandbox evasion or maybe even

648
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,030
recognize if you do  you know I am

649
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,700
virtual mattia many servers the rest takes a

650
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,860
commissioner

651
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,930
if they are a virtual machine they have to

652
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,760
use being able to matera

653
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,190
integral visual on the always physical somatic

654
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,720
very high application that it receives on the

655
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,970
would be fixed to maybe be

656
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,720
able to move and mind

657
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,250
once all this  almost past

658
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,400
if the inspiration which generally if

659
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,960
the attack is not aimed only at

660
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,300
destroying something and filtered

661
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,790
graphically or the techniques I

662
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,060
had said before then ns with data

663
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,230
encoded inside through also for

664
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,239
example you can record the audio of the pc

665
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,090
or  the video then perhaps going to

666
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,889
record all the information you

667
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:27,350
believe that they pass in the offices of the

668
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,929
business as perhaps

669
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,949
confidential information is communicated can be

670
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,199
collected and Latin network shells that

671
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,070
come you can only access and it is a

672
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,090
fairly common situation

673
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,780
basically at the end of  this there

674
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,409
are two ways or you are a so-called

675
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:53,719
never intent  born or you are doing it

676
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,080
because you are among the professionals or you want to

677
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,160
invent IT security

678
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,350
so you are doing it

679
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,720
according to let's say not having signed a

680
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:11,060
contract having signed which one discovers it

681
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,300
malicious activity after having

682
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,250
carried out the activity

683
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,540
if you have broken everything that

684
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,010
needs nothing  of khost go to

685
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,830
andrea destroy everything all the evidence

686
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,020
maybe even going to

687
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,930
seriously destroy the system formed the server

688
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,920
there is no longer a test inside if

689
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,180
these are not detected and

690
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,240
stored in external servers is one of

691
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,860
the simplest methods  to hide

692
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:47,480
his traces also licia never again

693
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,190
surely then it is detected but maybe it is not

694
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,260
known who or how he carried out the

695
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,110
activities that in the best

696
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,910
professional his sion stopped for

697
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,060
once carried out having always

698
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,890
managed to carry out the activities

699
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,350
instead of destroying everything and  there was

700
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,970
a detailed report to the company

701
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,820
not to specify what the stages are  in

702
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,040
each phase

703
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,210
perhaps that referring precisely

704
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,410
to being the bearer in many years 3 and

705
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,230
which tech that used in which

706
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,859
certain phases to

707
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,720
detail it in a report so that it

708
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,880
is that the customer can go maybe

709
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,700
absolutism and say why we have

710
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,539
detected the lateral movement or the

711
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:32,489
our antivirus video has detected

712
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:35,450
that event has not been analyzed

713
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,710
this helps a lot to identify

714
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,480
which are the weak points of the company

715
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:51,509
which they are nor to improve my

716
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,950
experience also worked in the security

717
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,630
operation center that I did the part

718
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,299
of the votes but it is in fact  one of the

719
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,539
biggest problems we encountered iii reich not

720
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:04,980
seeing what was happening but

721
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,829
not because we didn't have any yes and then

722
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,359
what there were no tools to

723
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,099
go and view certain

724
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,650
activities and therefore when

725
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,380
some problem happened it was

726
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,380
difficult  to go and recover how he

727
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,499
arrived as the attacker entered

728
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:24,960
or how he did maybe in situ  actions

729
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,440
data or other type of attack

730
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:37,350
this is a bit the is a topic that

731
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,630
I find very interesting miter attacks

732
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,840
the very recent one basically

733
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,080
I would say that to look for it on the internet on the

734
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,210
site there are many more details there are

735
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,590
details even if all criminals and there  it is

736
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,910
a dynamic section in which

737
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,980
buzzer group can be selected there are

738
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,870
many it would be the

739
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:38,130
first group recreations too many but I

740
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,660
think that in the world of research

741
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,660
and geography 6 on the model of the

742
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,729
large clearly then when doing

743
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:49,779
checks your model is safe

744
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:59,529
against attackers  of the antarctic projects

745
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:01,749
a cryptographic product 15 against

746
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:04,299
model attacks where away and

747
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:06,759
resistant in companies instead then

748
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:09,069
defines the spot define what

749
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:12,789
cannot be done then why

750
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:14,559
it is done well I can also feel

751
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:16,779
safe and I can also from the point of view

752
00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:18,880
legal to be okay but you do it because you do

753
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,710
n't care about safety if you do it

754
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,579
out of ignorance

755
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:23,410
what the mot is  activation for which I decided a

756
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,660
stop and defines me a model that is not

757
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,259
realistic

758
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,319
one of the reasons we have seen may

759
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:39,219
be one of the area the fact that we

760
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:40,989
are hired perhaps after one of the

761
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:42,400
company functions that may be

762
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,349
internal loris and perhaps does not know how

763
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:52,119
to tell the privileges to force the shady

764
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,589
to broaden the scope of the whole company

765
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:57,969
because maybe it has done we have been

766
00:39:57,969 --> 00:39:59,160
agreed at the level of business

767
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,319
terminated targets but also to say that

768
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:07,450
I know if we used precisely they

769
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,019
had no limits we could

770
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:13,779
go and collect data  of the company

771
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:16,150
that does not even want under contract

772
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,579
that they are maybe and shared that there

773
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:21,609
may be prototype projects

774
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:22,890
of max

775
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,599
from future machines and maybe that are

776
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,420
still the gesture

777
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,539
this can be one of the various

778
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:35,279
reasons one of the others this is  the fact

779
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:38,640
that even a budget reason

780
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,309
generally the more the perimeter

781
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:43,289
widens the more it takes time to

782
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:45,240
carry out the activities and therefore I

783
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,069
am  extra days from which the customer has to

784
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,079
pay so you can call this

785
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,569
compartmentalize that but another thing

786
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:54,750
and it can also be because some of the

787
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,089
employees generally don't like it

788
00:40:57,089 --> 00:40:59,670
when they realize they are

789
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,180
undergoing a safety test and this

790
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,109
creates discontent all  'inside the

791
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:05,970
company if we say

792
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,829
the reason for that activity is not correctly communicated,

793
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:09,569
such as

794
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:12,569
a finishing campaign, it is agreed we

795
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:13,890
do neither to everyone but maybe not

796
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,220
prominent profiles because they could

797
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,880
take it

798
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,049
and instead they are made by those who

799
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:21,680
are more targeted than they should

800
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,049
being trained and trained from this

801
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:43,079
point of view of the company some

802
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,509
staff notices and of the

803
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:51,289
cyrus share company

804
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:56,160
this always depends on the pre-agreements

805
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,160
that have been made with the company

806
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,220
between those who carry out traction tests and those who

807
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,509
are undergoing it because  for ration test it can

808
00:42:06,509 --> 00:42:09,869
be carried out both in generally in two

809
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:12,539
bar three modes of the white box and

810
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,009
black box

811
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:18,720
the  which also means the white box,

812
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,089
generally

813
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:22,950
information on the corporate structure is also given and information

814
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,930
is communicated to the

815
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,670
security part that there is an activity in progress

816
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,000
that we must not be blocked

817
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,040
maybe we must perhaps

818
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,990
want to verify what is

819
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,390
detected but they do not block us  just to

820
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:40,610
see how robust they are to resist

821
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,130
in protection in other cases just

822
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,540
when maybe we are hired

823
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,850
by the internal audit in the company this

824
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,310
thing is done nobody

825
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,630
knows it maybe four people inside the

826
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,390
company let the ceo know the

827
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:57,800
head of the straight straight hours and

828
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,100
therefore we have to do much less even

829
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,870
let's say much more low-

830
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,640
profile activities

831
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,450
we must try to make as little noise as

832
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,250
possible because there is we know that maybe

833
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,660
there is someone on the other side who

834
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,240
is actively watching and traffic

835
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,670
yesterday practically  look at the alarms and

836
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,350
then alpa we must all have another type

837
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:23,660
of technique has found you can an  than to

838
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,340
differentiate the activity between the classic

839
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,430
penetration testing that precisely activities

840
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,220
in which the technological systems are generally attacked

841
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,590
web servers

842
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,380
web applications so on of the

843
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,100
trading activities that instead expand let's say

844
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,310
to the attack surface and also go to

845
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:45,320
test the physical security of

846
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,400
people precisely  maybe even going to

847
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,520
try to bypass the

848
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,480
door access system or

849
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,660
maybe trying to enter the circuit the cameras

850
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,900
these are activities that

851
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,810
are generally more elaborate life precisely

852
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,900
would say team that among other things

853
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,660
we also do mg when that is not

854
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,460
required  in short, it depends a little on

855
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,960
how agreed with the company if

856
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,050
the company has been agreed that they

857
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,520
must put us on the white list

858
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,020
because they want both scanning and

859
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,460
doing a well-rounded activity

860
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,800
otherwise they say no we will see them

861
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,599
with the  systems and protection that is already there

862
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,970
what you can do then

863
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,190
actually the real impact ch  and

864
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,680
I could have, however, as we said precisely

865
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,750
the purpose of everything for the purpose because the

866
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,320
classic criminal does not go to respect

867
00:44:49,320 --> 00:45:05,220
the rules here is what they say the

868
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,680
reconnaissance phase wants to be visual

869
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,109
there are cases pulse relaunch of the

870
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:11,450
company

871
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,180
then you can be invisible or if then if

872
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,920
it can always be detected in tennis

873
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,250
yes even using there are two different types

874
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:24,030
of two different types of condition the

875
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,460
passive and the active one in the active case

876
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,500
you are going so you contact

877
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,140
directly the systems objects the systems

878
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,760
of the target company there is no contact

879
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,540
direct with the company depending on what

880
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,880
type of reconnaissance can go more or

881
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,470
less unnoticed because obviously

882
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:47,030
maybe a company that already on its

883
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,890
public site receive

884
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,730
high traffic a character might not

885
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,170
arouse

886
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,050
suspicion unless it does

887
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,690
really voluminous coastal activities  however there is the paste

888
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,099
of passive cognition which instead

889
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,859
concerns all that part of going to

890
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:06,000
find information about the company

891
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,250
without going to contact all the

892
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,220
company systems that can be

893
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,750
found information for example about

894
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,730
employees on social networks

895
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,550
in that case or a year maybe interrogate

896
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,780


897
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,430
[Music]

898
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,470
to make all the information

899
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:27,170
we make clear notified interactions

900
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,029
there was the site there are the

901
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:31,160
administrators  and so on

902
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,930
in that case the other passive mission

903
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,599
not going to touch the company

904
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,420
and so on is not detected one of the

905
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,519
activities that maybe can be done to

906
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:43,099
help companies also protect themselves

907
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:45,229
from this type of thing are the

908
00:46:45,229 --> 00:46:47,029
osint activities  of open source intelligence

909
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:48,589
seems to identify which public data of the

910
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:51,739
company could

911
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:54,529
ever be used for sea flights

912
00:46:54,529 --> 00:46:57,079
and understand how often they are exposed from

913
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:26,089
this point of view one of the cases is

914
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:27,799
because maybe those data are published

915
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:30,140
on the internet if they are made  account

916
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,559
only after they have been published

917
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,049
perhaps on past vino rather than other

918
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:39,109
data breach sites and then go to

919
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,630
actually to do in-

920
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,789
depth analysis but not to do

921
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:47,719
forensic analysis generally for some some

922
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:51,499
companies keep stored in dogs

923
00:47:51,499 --> 00:47:54,349
even to go to me precisely when for

924
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:56,089
this reason there are policies that

925
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:57,890
force companies to keep

926
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,859
certain types of data over time

927
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:02,719
those may not be analyzed

928
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,640
actively resists monitoring because there

929
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,589
may not be the

930
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,410
processing capacity to do it

931
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,559
many times to be able to monitor

932
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,809
everything especially when people

933
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:22,809
start to get very big

934
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:25,549
you have to have to devote a high

935
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:28,960
security budget that is not always

936
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,450
let's say allocated not

937
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,910
many times not people do not aim

938
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,970
prevention but they run for cover

939
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,700
only when they have suffered and from there where they

940
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,280
go a posteriori and it is something that we

941
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,320
obviously advise against another

942
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,349
reason could be the having

943
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:54,890
identified maybe the security department

944
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:01,700
goes to discover that in the previous two years they

945
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,440
are  were brought gods

946
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,780
specific attacks and maybe with 10 gods

947
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,970
who had not been known who then

948
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,040
became public have verified

949
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,869
that their vulnerable systems have done

950
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:14,510
some checks indeed they have noticed it may

951
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,890
depend on various factors but

952
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:18,368
generally
