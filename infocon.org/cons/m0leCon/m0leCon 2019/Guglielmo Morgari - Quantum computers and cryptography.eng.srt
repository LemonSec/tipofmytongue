00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:07,670
Let's start again now with the presentations

3
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,699
thanks to aldo for the introduction

4
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,460
of my speech in which I would like to

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,040
share with you some

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,840
considerations on how much one especially

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,880
on the impact of quantum on

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,469
cryptography and therefore on

9
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,320
IT security and quickly see

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,180
what happens  in this world in

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,160
the field of research and application in

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,129
russia,

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,170
but I am not today

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,090
the company I work for to make curiosity, but I believe that

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,809
two very quick words are useful to

16
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,789
explain the context in which we work and

17
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,199
the reason why we work  of

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,440
these same a company one hundred percent

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,780
part of the telecom italia group

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,479
that deals with it will claim back the moment of the

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,760
foundation almost 50 years ago of

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,030
cryptography in the civil field but

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,130
above all in the government field

24
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,500
and this is the reason why as

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,630
accelerating we are under native buner protection

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,780
through the golden powers and of the

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,060
motif given the delicacy of the years

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,740
that you apply in which we move for  which

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,840
we always try to

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,079
pay close attention to everything that in the short but

31
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,490
also in a medium-long

32
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,470


33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,930


34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,530


35
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,360


36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,460
term perspective can

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,920
be relevant.  physics that deals with

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,229
the microscopic therefore of a

39
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,049
tonal level which on the sub atomic side is a

40
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,759
level of reality in which

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,450
somewhat strange things happen counterintuitive

42
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,009
compared to what we are used to

43
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,020
perceiving in everyday life and among the

44
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,740
strange things that happen

45
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,399
there is that  quantum quantities

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,170
do not assume values in a continuous way

47
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,989
as we are used to seeing but in a discrete way,

48
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,520
i.e. they are quantized the quantum

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,180
is the minimum indivisible unit whose

50
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,340
multiples can be values assumed by

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,819
these quantum riches to give an

52
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,890
example of how much they then

53
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,140
later picked up the photon and the

54
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,239
when of the light and determines the energy

55
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,910
that can be transp  brought by light as a

56
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,410
function of its

57
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,810
wavelength, technology today begins to handle quantum phenomena with

58
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,660
a certain skill and precision

59
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,040
and therefore manages to

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,800
open the door of applications that to

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,480
me, who are not a physicist, seem

62
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,569
absolutely magical and fantastic

63
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,430
among these.  it is as much as a computer that

64
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,690
we will talk about shortly when a computer

65
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,269
of the impacts on cryptography and

66
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,700
quantum mechanics also offers

67
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,130
cryptography here not only the ability to

68
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,549
attack it lacks the ability to receive

69
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,959
then there is another strand that I have put in

70
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,549
brackets because of  tex and monet

71
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,130
strictly quantum the pos as

72
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,989
the victory that a

73
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,549
mathematical application that runs on classical computers,

74
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,349
however, is a response to the quantum threat of the

75
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,930
quantum computer

76
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,190
and then there are many other applications

77
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,140
that I have listed but of which today

78
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,510
we will not pay for quantum communications

79
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,370
based  on the concept of delay in the mind

80
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,730
of gods and qubits there is the

81
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,980
quant generation processes  istics of random data

82
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,140
which also for cryptography are very

83
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,170
interesting because in this case the

84
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,269
generation of random atria is not based

85
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,049
on very complicated classical processes

86
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:58,400
that being so complicated

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,920
we are unable to predict and therefore appear

88
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,750
random but are based precisely on the

89
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,120
intrinsic randomness of the logic

90
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,880
quantum since 16 since it

91
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,400
takes advantage of the characteristics

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,739
of quantum mechanics adversaries

93
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,709
precision measurements higher than those

94
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,779
obtainable with the

95
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,010
classical model and so on

96
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,850
now let's talk for a moment about how much a

97
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,560
computer is when a computer was

98
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,200
theoretically conceived in the 80s

99
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,419
when you do but in the desserts they realized

100
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,000
that to study quantum mechanics it

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,210


102
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,770
was appropriate to simulate it simulating it with a

103
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,480
classical computer it goes

104
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,240
unnaturally tiring and it would have been much

105
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,760
more efficient to simulate through a

106
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,520
computer that used the same logics the

107
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,800
same physical rules of what  you know how to

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,510
go to study and here  ndi was born the

109
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,720
concept of quantum computer

110
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,610
concept that has remained such for

111
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,139
many years is considered substantially

112
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,830
not feasible and that is based on a

113
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,850
different different concept of

114
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,220
information processing that is we no longer have the

115
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,620
classic bits that take on a value of zero and

116
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,750
one  to which we are used but we have

117
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,210
instead the concept of quantum qubit b

118
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,919
which can certainly assume

119
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,860
values 0 1 but in general

120
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,770
substantially assumes a

121
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,330
superposition of these values in a

122
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,879
certain sense of the same time 0 1

123
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,280
according to different your baretta of being

124
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,550
zero of being one is  only when

125
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,120
it is then observed it collapses into a

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,300
specific zero value now it is clear that

127
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,539
this information management is

128
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:46,009
much richer than that of a

129
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:47,479
conflict with the classical one so

130
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,090
naturally encounter and quantum can

131
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,719
do many more things the point is that it

132
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:56,750
cannot  to do everything there will be some things

133
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,759
that compared to a classical

134
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,919
computer the quantum computer will be able to

135
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,509
do me  much better

136
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,240
extraordinarily better but there are

137
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,699
other things where from the

138
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,830
quantum computer we will have no advantage

139
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,349
over a stone computer and this is

140
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:14,029
a very important aspect right away I will

141
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:15,860
ask you later

142
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,279
the following question is the things where

143
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,870
the quantum point can be  useful

144
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,020
impact also on cryptography

145
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,389
the answer is yes there as we will see it is

146
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,069
this and it is the reason why the

147
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,960
most technologically advanced governments and also

148
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,120
with greater economic investment capacities

149
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,180
are focusing a lot on

150
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,770
its quantum computer

151
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,779
it follows that in recent years we have

152
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:43,039
witnessed  of

153
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,800
technological improvements and extremely relevant

154
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,219
we have the first prototypes that are not and

155
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,589
probably will not be long

156
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:53,360
finished products but are no longer

157
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,300
just toys the big players

158
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,889
in the industry at the google

159
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,599
microsoft wave sites all have their

160
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:03,879
quantum computers

161
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,310
not  it is clear if and when the product will arrive

162
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,139
it is not even clear if q  When

163
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,389
we get there it will be something dedicated

164
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,120
to the so-called governmental clans or maybe it

165
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,949
will arrive in the homes of each of us

166
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,099
certainly we are witnessing a

167
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,139
huge acceleration in the search

168
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,950
for results

169
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,260
in this helps help a whole series

170
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,820
of initiatives in my opinion it is worth

171
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,610
highlighting that of  ibm which makes

172
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,610
a quantum simulator available to anyone on the internet

173
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,090
through which it

174
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,460
is possible to develop and test quantum aphorisms on their pc

175
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,620


176
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,290
and then also possible in the cloud to

177
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,720
have a quantum computer run on a quantum computer must

178
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,240
just stay at home in order

179
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,650
to verify and compare  the result

180
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,930
now 22 definitions that are very

181
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,550
often found in the media when talking about

182
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,960
how much a

183
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,180
quantum computer advantage is the

184
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,020
situation where you identify a problem that the

185
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,990
quantum computer can

186
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,330
solve significantly faster than a

187
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,070
classical computer

188
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,660
the next step is  quantum supremacy

189
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,730
when the c  quantum computer

190
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,770
will be able to solve a problem

191
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,110
that the classical computer cannot

192
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,480
solve in reality this is a

193
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,100
definition to take a bit with a grain of salt

194
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,500
because it is at the top of the classic if you

195
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,090
give it enough time it can solve

196
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,370
any problem

197
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,039
the point is how long are you if  it takes

198
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,110
hundreds thousands millions of years

199
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,299
in practice it is as if I could not

200
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,020
solve it and precisely on this issue there has

201
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,120
been a funny

202
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,670
dispute between google and ibm in recent months

203
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,890
because in September google published only

204
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,800
to withdraw it but then confirm it

205
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,890
a pepper on the  nasa site that provides

206
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,570
the times in the short time in which it was

207
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,480
published could see in which it

208
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,800
claimed to have identified a

209
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,190
specific problem in particular was the

210
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,920
ability to recognize certain

211
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,600
statistical regularities within

212
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,040
random sequences this problem the 200 seconds

213
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,900
and evaluated that  the fastest

214
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,090
classic computer in existence and incidentally

215
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,970
is the IBM immediately would have taken

216
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,570
10 mi  the free years a little bit piqued

217
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,550
said no it's true what you did

218
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,110
very interesting but you

219
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,340


220
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,780
miscalculated our computer would do it in two

221
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,310
days

222
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,090
so there is a certain difference and you understand

223
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,340
that here it is more about marketing than about

224
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,830
them  real technological difference

225
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,940
let's take a step to the side

226
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,550
let's look at the classic cryptographic system

227
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,860
and understand how this

228
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,080
impacted against a computer then

229
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,510
why familiarize with the annotation

230
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,310
concepts of photography the two

231
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,560
characters you see are the classic

232
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,720
alice bob who want to exchange a

233
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,820
secret message  here a receives a

234
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,650
clear message encrypts it on the

235
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,970
channel and bob del lode clearly encrypts

236
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,180
this encoding from alice will

237
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,380
require some key that

238
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,460
determines which way the message

239
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,910
is encrypted all right except that

240
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,320
clearly we just moved the

241
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,450
problem from  transfer message

242
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,520
securely to transfer and share

243
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,839
between high school bob the key securely

244
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,460
this key is a symmetric key

245
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,529
in the sense that alice bomba will have the

246
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,810
same one-sided way that is used to

247
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,390
encrypt it is also used to decipher in

248
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,920
this context photography has

249
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,660
worked for many years and since the

250
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,030
time of julius caesar and even before and

251
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,920
in certain applications  continues to

252
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,230
work even now let's

253
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,450
imagine the two police officers who,

254
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,790
before leaving for their mission

255
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,950
under the command of the police, share

256
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,250
their key on their radios or the 22

257
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,750
secret service agents who

258
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,190
are at the airport bar

259
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,260
exchange a piece of paper with the  key and

260
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,260
then each go their own way

261
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,480
all is well but it is a model that today

262
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
works only in a

263
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,760
very small fraction of Italy

264
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,080
what interests us today is to understand in

265
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,730
a world like the internet

266
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,890
this system still works the

267
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,410
answer clearly no because if we

268
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,780
want  do the classic

269
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,420
online shopping with an

270
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,910
e-commerce seller who

271
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,060
is in australia surely we

272
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,640
want the  communication is protected because

273
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,110
we send over our

274
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,690
credit card number but certainly we have not previously

275
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,120
shared a key

276
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,500
with this polani shop and here we

277
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,080
are helped

278
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,330
by cryptographic mechanisms that became

279
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,690
in the 70s that make a small

280
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,480
mathematical magic that is, the two parties make

281
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,220
a series of calculations locally they

282
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,710
exchange a series of data on the

283
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,390
channel of a publicly accessible

284
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,600
internet channel which, however, can be read by

285
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,120
the end in the meantime the two parts have a

286
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,090
secret key that they share synthetic

287
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,430
that they use that only they know and

288
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,170
whoever has intercepted the channel

289
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,450
has no way of obtaining the same value

290
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,490
these mechanisms are based on

291
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,130
so-called systems with asymmetric key or

292
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,870
public key which al is asymmetric because

293
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,420
unlike what will happen here but the

294
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,430
key used for cipher is different from the

295
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,710
key used to decrypt

296
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,300
also calls the republishing system because

297
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,700
each user av  he will a public

298
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,890
key a private key his

299
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,780
public key makes it public by

300
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,320
saying

301
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,330
anyone who wants to encrypt a message for

302
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,510
me uses this key to decrypt it

303
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,950
I can only do it I who have the

304
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,590
corresponding call taken care of if we want to

305
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,900
think of an analogy in the world

306
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,620
think of the mailbox and I

307
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,270
say anyone who wants to send me a

308
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,010
message puts it in my mailbox

309
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,170
of this republic

310
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,810
only I who have the corresponding

311
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,030
physical key with which I can open the mailbox

312
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,160
I can withdraw and read

313
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,220
inconveniences and this is the  private key hours

314
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,230
in the algorithms describing the mathematicians

315
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,240
with which this is done would take

316
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,060
some time but if it is quite

317
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,630
understandable that a mechanism in which it is

318
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,340
easy to do an operation one way is

319
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,530
difficult to do it in the other is based on a

320
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,370
problem but  theme

321
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,990
with the same characteristic

322
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,660
and in today's cryptography

323
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,459
essentially two mathematical problems

324
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,260
of this type are used: p  rimo is called

325
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,970
the integer factorization problem

326
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,860
and the second

327
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,290
discrete logarithm problem this like just to

328
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,270
give you an idea of how

329
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,520
the integer factorization problem works

330
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,680
we see it directly on an

331
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,470
example if I ask you what 521

332
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,959
547 is maybe some of you  that's okay

333
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,720
almost everyone takes a pen and paper and a

334
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,050
few seconds give me the answer but

335
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,760
if I ask you which are the two numbers that

336
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,630
multiplied together are 280 2943 and

337
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,209
you see that they are numbers very similar to

338
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,630
those we have considered here

339
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,900
well the answer is not like this  immediate

340
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,810
probably try a little a few

341
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,700
minutes a few hours at the end maybe

342
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,610
you can get one from gaylib give up

343
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,470
interesting thing that the same goes

344
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,210
for calculators you are really a calculator

345
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,120
on different scales but if a

346
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,670
calculator has two numbers of 500 b

347
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,100
to multiply in  a split

348
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,170
second throw out corresponding number

349
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,540
from a thousand's but if we give it a number

350
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,480
from a thousand b  it o wrote 1024 for the

351
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,340
number of events that typically used

352
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,320
in photography but let's say a thousand can

353
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,630
be login and size that number a

354
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,210
computer does not know how to factor it but

355
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,890
does not know for the simple fact that we

356
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,960
do not know algorithms so we cannot

357
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,850
have also avoided algorithms on  this

358
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,040
calculator can

359
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,469
quickly calculate the two factors of an ambush

360
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,640
another problem that is often used

361
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,280
is that of the discrete logarithm here it

362
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,010
is a question of doing the exponential one modulo

363
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,140
a certain number exponential file doing

364
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,600
the modulo calculation means taking

365
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,040
stops of the division then  it is for

366
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,180
example 15 module 7 is one for 15 17

367
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,620
is two then also here if I ask you 19

368
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,880
to 7 module 191 do the math on

369
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,150
paper and pen and target the result but if

370
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,830
I ask you what is that number to which

371
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,230
19 must be removed for the  blue blue module

372
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,640
191 and getting 94 things change and

373
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,070
even here the same is true his task he

374
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,630
knows how to do things quickly in a

375
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,440
sense he cannot do them

376
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,790
now  having said this let's see what is the

377
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,430
relationship between what the ritual is accomplished, we

378
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,730
know how much a computer that we said

379
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,330
thought in the 80s for a long time

380
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,910
considered a purely

381
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:12,640
theoretical model on which some researchers have

382
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,220
decided to invest their time to re

383
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,110
-agree perhaps does not exist  it will never exist

384
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,440


385
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,360
but let's pretend that it exists let's see

386
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,190
if and how we can

387
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,620
finish some algorithms that exploit the

388
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,150
specific characteristics of a

389
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,490
quantum computer to obtain

390
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,930
results that otherwise I would not be able to

391
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,800
obtain.

392
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240


393
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,350
the two most famous products

394
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,690
concern cryptography

395
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,460
the first concerns asymmetric cryptography

396
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,440
that is the one that, as we

397
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,630
said before, if you really give

398
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,520
a number once there is a shared symmetric key

399
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,150


400
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,180
the algorithm was designed by glover and

401
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,080
the effect of this algorithm  and that

402
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,250
the attack brings the equivalent security

403
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,839
of the algorithm to have u  a key

404
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,310
of lized length that is an algorithm

405
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,329
that we have today neither often happens 128

406
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,000
key bits then assume nd the

407
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
complexity of attack 2 la 128 with the

408
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,010
griffin rovers a quantum computer at

409
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,319
an attack complexity of dua from 64

410
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,959
then from the point of view  of the cryptographer

411
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,180
this is terribly devastating because it

412
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,750
means going from 128 64 bit

413
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,480
security which means the attack

414
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,540
ends a 100 billion billion

415
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,190
times faster than what you feel

416
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,610


417
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,680
downloaded actually this is not a big

418
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,780
deal because it is enough

419
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,490
double the beauty of the fairy tale

420
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,430
instead of keys of 128 we use keys of

421
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,010
256 bits at the elbows of this length

422
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,410
are already there if we are already using them we

423
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,910
have nothing to do

424
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,160
the problem is solved this because in

425
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,220
terms of complexity theory

426
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,110
the algorithm of fraud and  still

427
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,420
exponential so increasing the

428
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,220
length of the key we solve

429
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,020
quiet

430
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,460
completely different is when we talk about

431
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,440
key algorithms  and therefore publishes

432
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,720
those arguments that allow us to

433
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,550
get to coexist a secret key

434
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,090
really doctor these algorithms are

435
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,000
based on mathematical problems that today

436
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,640
are considered intractable

437
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,060
classical dexters and two in fact used

438
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,190
everywhere are exactly

439
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,930
the railway problem you have to keep

440
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,490
discrete logarithm that  we have seen

441
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,780
before that they are the basis of the cryptographic dual vvt

442
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,670
that are used

443
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,420
basically for any

444
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,460
internet communication and a dream that

445
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,650
is called non rsa and of films well

446
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,510
the algorithm from the quantum computer of

447
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,450
money however it is completely these two

448
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,030
problems completely breaking means

449
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,550
that  the complexity of the attacks is no

450
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,770
longer exponential in the names in the

451
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,620
length of the key for which

452
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,000
doubling the key quadruple kharja

453
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,860
to complicate the hundredfold

454
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,550
is useless

455
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,740
these algorithms are structurally

456
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:17,150
broken and must be replaced very well the

457
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,860
community that the graphic has for a long time  has

458
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,600
peace of mind  nte ignored this problem

459
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,800
because he considered it a purely

460
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,750
theoretical problem because

461
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,010
quantum computers would never have been

462
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,730
this until August 2015 when

463
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,130
suddenly, without any warning signal,

464
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,770
the ennese ace to the

465
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,540
American national security agency

466
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,750
published an announcement on its website  who said

467
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,020
guys from now on just make sure

468
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,880
I have algorithms that are

469
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,240
somewhat resistant because everyone did

470
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,000
it wondered why they knew that

471
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,710
Chinese already have a quantum computer

472
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,740
maybe they fear they are going to dario

473
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,240
themselves they have it and therefore  they think that

474
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,350
you also have the others

475
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,740
whatever the reason panic in the

476
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,970
clean that I have graphics etc. of

477
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,940
course even if someone can still

478
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,169
be skeptical that the

479
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,480
quantum computer from the error you can not

480
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,799
ignore the possibility that this happens

481
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,780
and this is a problem  because

482
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,190
a solution needs to be found

483
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,830
quickly, taking into account that much

484
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,600
needs to be developed  and new technologies and

485
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,510
this takes technical once

486
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,460
developed they must be standardized because

487
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,679
even if we have a secure system but the

488
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:34,900
two parties do not use the same way they

489
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,059
will never speak and even

490
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,240
standardization requires

491
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,789
implementation takes time because because if

492
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:45,130
we have a system that

493
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,840
security works we don't see it

494
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,850
we know it's there but we don't see it and they

495
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,260
tell us take your system that

496
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,120
works on which you do shady deals and

497
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,039
make money and replace it with

498
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,830
this new one because it is safer

499
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,419
maybe people don't really want to

500
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,150
to do it therefore also time of

501
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,059
deployment can be very long moreover

502
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,270
the useful life of an encrypted message

503
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,309
can also be very long which

504
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,970
means that if today we create a

505
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,820
message for ourselves, for example that contains a

506
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,740
state secret

507
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,770
we want by content to  legislation for

508
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,220
a sense that this remains secret for

509
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,730
thirty years

510
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,440
or without disturbing the state secret

511
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,350
we have a message that protects

512
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,090
d  and sensitive individual data

513
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,280
could be genetic data that in

514
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,530
30 years will still be those and if we will

515
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,030
still be b there will still be sensitive data

516
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,039


517
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,770
we want that in twenty years 50 years

518
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,220
those data are still powerful if

519
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,650
someone records today those

520
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,360
communications that we transmit on the

521
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,220
internet and  someone who does it

522
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,280
certainly does not know how to decipher it now

523
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,110
but in ten years when there will be the

524
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,740
quantum computer it knows how to do it and we will

525
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,230
still be fully within the

526
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,059
first period in which the message should

527
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,390
absolutely remain salento so it

528
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,539
is a problem

529
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,320
it is a problem to be solved quickly

530
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,729
the roads that are currently

531
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:19,879
identified are two one is called o

532
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,639
span cryptography which is a

533
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:26,149
mathematical solution and the other is a

534
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:28,429
physical solution based on

535
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:30,350
quantum mechanics which is called although

536
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,049
distribution

537
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:34,489
two words on both from kroos  how much

538
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:38,379
encrypt what after the announcement of

539
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,850
the message has been a very

540
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,239
activity  o intense research

541
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,340
within the pictographic unit app

542
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,769
in search of new

543
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,349
cryptographic algorithms based on

544
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:53,659
mathematical problems that unlike those

545
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:56,119
sheared numbers were not attackable to the

546
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:59,200
quantum computer the nist

547
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,409
immediately started a

548
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:07,249
search process of submission of

549
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:09,499
selection of  new primitives that were

550
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:12,619
resistant to the quantum point in

551
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:13,549
2016

552
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:17,179
hoping to close in 2020 48 years

553
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,159
are a lot but in the list that does this

554
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:20,840
job for a living he knows that to

555
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,479
arrive at a standardized final result

556
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:26,419
if we get there in eight

557
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,700
years it is okay if  nothing prevents the

558
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,090
week and a half when everything seems

559
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,619
defined is finalized a researcher

560
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,779
raises his hand and explains that that system

561
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:38,059
that will ask for safe is actually not

562
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:40,509
safe

563
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,729
at the end of 2000 and 17

564
00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:46,159
69 proposals were presented earlier this year c  '

565
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,139
was a selection pen I remained

566
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,830
26 including a

567
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,169
completely Italian one born from a

568
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:55,729
collaboration  and of the Politecnico di Milano

569
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:57,950
with the Polytechnic University of

570
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,979
Marche

571
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,599
technically all the proposals fall

572
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,879
into five families of mathematical problems,

573
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:08,229
the first two, as highlighted,

574
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:12,349
are the ones that seem more solid

575
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:14,840
have more study behind them and are

576
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,729
those from which

577
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:22,020
the winning solutions will probably emerge and  curiously

578
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,370
they also have another feature,

579
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,260
especially the first one, cryptography

580
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,600
based on arcades which in 1978

581
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,330
michelis presented a

582
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,710
cryptographic system based on this theory

583
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,060
which was then discarded because it was

584
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,270
considered very secure but less efficient in

585
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,500
practice because it had

586
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,360
very long keys  therefore difficult to

587
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,310
manage compared to the fights in the

588
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,080
movies here

589
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,940
bad luck wants that he had of firmans

590
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,370
are part of those problems that a

591
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,130
quantum computer brings

592
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,260
code-based encryption is one of

593
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,940
those problems that a

594
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,190
quantum computer to date cannot attack

595
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,280
therefore the  me keys system 40 years ago it

596
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,310
was g  ià quantum resistant is in fact

597
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,670
now back in vogue and is the basis of

598
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,930
a whole series of proposals for the

599
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,340
only one as it also

600
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,200
obviously exists trying to optimize the

601
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,270
islands some problems but the concept is

602
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,860
what already existed 40 years ago and  that

603
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,470
had been discarded and the same, albeit

604
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,240
in more recent times, applies to the

605
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,370
cryptography based on the crisis on the

606
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,590
lattices in which 96 entered

607
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,420
was already as resistant and is

608
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,340
now taken up in the visa proposals

609
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,400
the poplar rocks the physical one of the quantum

610
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,950
chi distribution because  physicists

611
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,740
say okay but thematic will be

612
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,020
brilliant they are very good but their

613
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,790
solutions are based on

614
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,490
conjectures that is they conjecture that

615
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,800
their problems are resistant to the

616
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,300
quantum computer

617
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,550
but no one can know for sure even

618
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,340
the rsa seemed very safe today it is no

619
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,250
longer and therefore what we do

620
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,440
if we cannot guarantee the solidity

621
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,870
of the encryption we prevent an

622
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,670
attacker from intercepting a taste

623
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,100
we believe  physically it also seems to

624
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,360
be the magic but

625
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,450
quantum cryptography actually locally and

626
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,950
it does it in this way usually

627
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,380
bobs have an optical channel typically

628
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,510
an optical fiber or even a free

629
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,120
space channel on which they encode

630
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,700
information in

631
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,659
quantum quantities for example in photons the

632
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:38,840
via these  photons if there is someone who

633
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,289
intercepts them the gleiser principle

634
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,970
guarantees us that at the same time and cool

635
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,870
intercepts liperpool by disturbing them bob

636
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,210
at destination he has noticed that something is

637
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,039
wrong with some intercepting

638
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:56,240
this solves part of the problem

639
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,190
because we know that the inter se  such but in the

640
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,919
meantime they said imma be then the

641
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,950
solution instead of the message what

642
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,080
we transmit on the quantum channel

643
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,010
is a random key when bob receives

644
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,519
the key and is confident that no one

645
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,799
has intercepted it means that at that

646
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,169
point alice bob have a

647
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,820
symmetric key of kune

648
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,380
at that  point can use a

649
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,870
classical world symmetric algorithm p

650
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,620
because we know that the quantum of a computer is not

651
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,539
a problem for algorithms even

652
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:31,490
similar ones it is for exchanging the key but

653
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,049
once the jazz key is no longer

654
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:38,360
a problem what the physicists say and

655
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,679
that this is a huge advantage

656
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,740
over the  mathematical photography

657
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,840
because safety is absolute and

658
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,159
absolute because it is not based on

659
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,559
mathematical conjectures but is based on

660
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,480
the very principles of quantum mechanics

661
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,549


662
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:54,289
this is true but all that glitters is not gold

663
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:55,700
because then at the very

664
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,950
moment in which these principles are

665
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,700
implemented real devices

666
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,230
necessarily  they introduce emos

667
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,360
that in any case a distance from

668
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,809
the age there is another problem that on

669
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:11,240
the quantum channel I the guarantee of being

670
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,039
able to safely transmit

671
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,190
information to the chin has taught me

672
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,080
well that I do not know that it is considered

673
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,779
that is if  instead of what I think it is

674
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:23,539
another way of knowing kg green circle

675
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,669
the authentication of the point part that

676
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,799
must be resolved in al

677
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,169
Finally, there is another more technological problem

678
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,570
than a conceptual one that with the increase

679
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,279
of the distance this is especially true

680
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,720
for the optical fibers

681
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,029
the signal is attenuated beyond a certain

682
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:39,710
level of attenuation it is no longer possible

683
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,570
to recognize the photons that

684
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,870
allow to realize the

685
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,340
quantum distribution of the  keys and

686
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,580
therefore every tot km today we are around

687
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,899
100 km and it is necessary to make an

688
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,580
optical conversion in the quantum classical

689
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,460
quantum and to launch signals those

690
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,710
are points here we pass to the classic

691
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,019
therefore the quantum guarantee

692
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:04,840
no longer exists they are points of possible

693
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,980
interception where they must be  points

694
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,679
between states therefore manned in which we are

695
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,090
sure that the attacker cannot

696
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,549
put his nose the fiber I was saying becomes

697
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:19,269
kapadia in fiber or in space where in fiber

698
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,590
the technological level is much much more

699
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,399
advanced it is true that it requires

700
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,039
infrastructure i.e. two the two parts of

701
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,450
course  must be connected by

702
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,500
an abbreviation it is also true that the fibers

703
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,419
necessa  re are the commercial reforms

704
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:37,340
that is the same fearless ones that are

705
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,080
now arriving at the home of many of us and will

706
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,269
do so in the next few years

707
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,320
technologically they are perfectly

708
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:50,559
suited to do qk beyond qk of free space

709
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,760
to the course advantage that we who

710
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,200
the infrastructure and therefore potentially

711
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,690
covers  a much larger area

712
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,090
but the technology is much more complicated

713
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,799
affected by many more factors for example

714
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,590
satellite days more complicated

715
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,070
because there is optical noise of the

716
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,820
sunlight affected by if it rains it becomes

717
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,559
complicated by atmospheric conditions

718
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,760
so life and therefore potentially  more

719
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,700
elastic a more work alone in the

720
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,950
figures that we see in the left one and

721
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,159
the so-called Italian quantum backbone

722
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,820
which is a fiber of almost

723
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,889
two thousand kilometers described by the

724
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:32,419
ingv national institute of metrology cassel

725
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:35,299
equa turin and with which, moreover, hotel is

726
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,460
a dedicated fiber optic connection

727
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,950
8 to do guilt experiments of which

728
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,129
unites the three main

729
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,690
research centers ita  liani on which

730
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,950
kde experiments are carried out

731
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,500
on the right instead there is a figure of the

732
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,200
Chinese juice satellite that a couple

733
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,210
of years ago became known because it

734
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,119
effectively demonstrated the feasibility

735
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,440
of the quantum distribution of

736
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:06,830
keys via satellite in the world what

737
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,909
happens to

738
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,590
the manufacturers of  devices with hood

739
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,590
of there are not many cells it is of quantic

740
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,809
that a Swiss company better than a

741
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,850
Swiss company has now passed under the

742
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,520
control of the south governments

743
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,639
then there is the south korea telecom there is the

744
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:25,970
american magic hulk quintessence slupsk

745
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,399
australian as much as there is tex that  tells us

746
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,679
that as you see European the European Union

747
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,649
is aware of this delay it is a

748
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:39,139
serious strategic delay and therefore it is

749
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:42,770
investing heavily in the world as for a

750
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,149
series of

751
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:47,419
recently funded project initiatives in June there

752
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,279
was a declaration a

753
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,100
joint signature of seven  member states

754
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,340
including Italy for the development of a

755
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,610
European quantum infrastructure on

756
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,460
which to certainly experiment  i of kd

757
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,619
as a first use case but also to

758
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,270
develop all those technologies that

759
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,679
were in the saga in sale to how much

760
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,260
comunication how much in six yes and so on

761
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:19,730
in italy what happens

762
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,649
I tell you what happens in the visibility

763
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,169
and activity of third parties

764
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:25,760
clearly this  does not pretend to

765
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,289
be exhaustive of everything that

766
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:29,799
happens in Italy but it is already

767
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,389
indicative as regards the pos as much as hearing

768
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:35,510
graphite there is an internal activity

769
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,409
that is carrying out my colleague

770
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:43,460
edoardo signorini who is there who works

771
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,059
on the quantum boss for  environments with

772
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:49,610
limited computing resources datos what it

773
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,860
already holds requires

774
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,880
significant resources becomes

775
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,200
particularly a problem when

776
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,060
these things are not there and it will be more and

777
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,700
more true going more and more often

778
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,450
applications hockey collaborates with the

779
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,550
polytechnic of turin collaborates with

780
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,920
alexia di trento collaborates with  the

781
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,990
decision that the

782
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,650
national photography association of

783
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,720
academia and industry research institutions that does a bit from  to the

784
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,540
connection between all the forces in

785
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,310
Italy that deal with this

786
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:26,560
time regarding the qk of I have listed

787
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,990
a series of industries and

788
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,360
research institutions working on this issue with

789
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,390
which we are collaborating

790
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,800
the interesting thing that makes me very

791
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,740
happy is that  this

792
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,750
collaborative effort at a national level among

793
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:45,300
many different actors and led by

794
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,800
governmental institutions therefore at the

795
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,930
government level there is a clear perception of the

796
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:55,750
importance of these issues to

797
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,680
conclude the initial question was in

798
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,240
how much a computer is a real problem yes

799
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,520
and if  it is not because maybe in the end

800
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,199
we were all wrong it will not arrive

801
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,580
as much as a computer in any case we have to

802
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,190
think for ustica

803
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,989
so it is necessary to develop

804
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:16,719
countermeasures as soon as possible and as

805
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,070
we have seen it could even if many the

806
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,460
two roads are bosses as much

807
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,540
as math cryptographers  that

808
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,830
physical distribution both have advantages

809
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,840
and disadvantages in different application scenarios

810
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,418
where there is the possibility of

811
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:37,090
having an infrastructure with a fiber that is

812
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,730
as beautiful as distribution where there

813
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,620
is no but probably a better

814
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,219
solution in turin, however, they are

815
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,870
complementary, nothing prevents us from thinking of a solution with belts

816
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,168
with very high safety requirements on connections with very high safety requirements.

817
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:52,960


818
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,389


819
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,530
let's put both of us

820
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,420
if one of the two then falls

821
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,690
under the attack that the index returns

822
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,780
there is still the other one is still there for

823
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,720
sure

824
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,700
and that is that a lot of development to do there is a

825
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,800
lot of investment to be put in place

826
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,740
both aside  of industries is perhaps

827
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:19,760
above all by governments to

828
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,040
close uses a joke before subject

829
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,810
a friend and this is what

830
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,279
[Applause]

831
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,859
[Music]

832
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,380
she said that 51 computing and

833
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,030
let's face it only deals with a coach

834
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:17,690
publicly threaten her you

835
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,910
shouldn't have as much  a computer like

836
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,480
a faster classic computer is a

837
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,820
computer that has a different model

838
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,619
so certain things can do them way

839
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,770
faster than 3 in case  of

840
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,599
asymmetric cryptography is actually

841
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,540
an acceleration that is very

842
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,640
significant but still remains

843
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,510
exponential with respect to the length

844
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,770
of the call therefore like the length

845
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:47,630
of the key if attacked from one side a

846
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,690
computer and how it was halved which is

847
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,240
an abysmal speed increase but it

848
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,920
is easy to solve  because in the

849
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,210
double and return level of

850
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,410
security here with the

851
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,810
asymmetric cryptography this does not work because

852
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,320
the type of algorithm is really different that

853
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,300
as much as a computer can be put

854
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,270
in place there are so many cases we are an

855
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,550
extremely significant advantage but

856
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,619
in  one and just structural so

857
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:17,230
we have to change

858
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,619
the one republic they are using

859
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:23,460
in the other is a speed up but it is not

860
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,920
structural and just lengthen the

861
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,050
length of the key lengthen

862
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,250
