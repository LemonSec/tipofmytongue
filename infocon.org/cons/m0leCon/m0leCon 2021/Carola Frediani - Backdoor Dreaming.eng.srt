1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,919
hi all um

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,240
my name is carol freddiani

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,480
my talk is going to be

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,280
way less technical than the one before

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,759
sorry for this but i don't have a

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,360
technical background

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,160
i have a journalistic background and i

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,240
covered cyber security civilians privacy

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,760
and today i'm going to talk about

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519
backdoors in a

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,000
wide meaning

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,960
so back about backdoor dreams

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,160
backdoor paranoia or backdoor nightmares

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,120
depending on the viewpoint and i'm going

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,000
to

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,360
analyze

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,280
a couple of cases that i found

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
interesting

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,840
and

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,680
the way they developed

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
the way the rumors

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,399
developed about these cases

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,640
if there was a backdoor it was no

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,280
backdoor at all and

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,879
if there is any

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,520
lesson learned because we know that

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,959
backdoors you know talks are

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,720
uh quite a hotly debated issue

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
and uh especially if you are talking

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,400
about security products

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,040
right so

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,640
so we

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
start from a story from the 60s actually

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
because

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,320
way before the online

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,960
troll farms we've been talking the last

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,240
year so the inauthentic coordinated

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,680
behavior

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
on social media

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
there were actually

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,799
cyphop and black propaganda operations

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,439
going on even you know of course in the

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,200
cold war era

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,799
and they were made of pamphlets and

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,840
radio broadcasts and so on

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,159
so uh this story actually came out a few

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,960
weeks ago so it's quite recent even if

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,840
it's talking about the 60s and it's

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
about this operation by the uk for an

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,320
office

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,000
and it's a propaganda arm

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,038
that

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,680
was had been assigned to

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
to steer indian indonesian

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
anti-communists

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,280
to overthrow this carno

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
regime it was a

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,480
left-leaning anti-colonialist regime so

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,599
they did it through black propaganda so

60
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,800
through

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720
actually they had the british

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,239
the british that published this pamphlet

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
that seemed to come from indonesian

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,720
emigre

65
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
and they were also circulating and

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
spreading

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
lies

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,920
and they did it also

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,599
through backdoor cipher machines

70
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,400
it's so intercepting and decoding the

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
communications of

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
the government

73
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,040
so basically the gchq

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,360
which is the british equivalent of the

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,720
nsa

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,680
could

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,959
break and

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,920
read indonesian encrypted messages

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
without problems so there is a

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,159
memorandum

81
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,120
that is highlighting the contribution

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
made through

83
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,319
second signal intelligence

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,959
so the materials they were able to

85
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,640
collect in the code would help the army

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,560
the generals to persecute in that case

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,680
the communist party and the sympathizers

88
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,560
so

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,920
how come so how come how did they how

90
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,440
were they able to do this

91
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
so uh of course the indonesian

92
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
government was one of the many

93
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,680
government in the world that were

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,040
that had

95
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,879
they bought this uh uh machines supplied

96
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,159
by the swiss company crypto ag

97
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
for 50 years crypto eg

98
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
supplied

99
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,200
secretly secretly sabotaged cypher

100
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
machines

101
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,798
and the american intelligence the west

102
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,120
german intelligence and the uk

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
intelligence were able to easily break

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,360
the codes we know this because

105
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,880
about one year ago there was this story

106
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,680
from

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,080
the washington post and some german

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,199
media

109
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,520
that were able to to get

110
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
the classified

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
cia history in internal history of the

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,759
whole operation and they had also the

113
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,720
internal history of the operation from

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,479
the end

115
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,800
and also they did also a lot of

116
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
interviews

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,199
so in this way they you know

118
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,840
reconstruct everything

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
and

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
this is regarded uh as the intelligence

121
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,440
coup of the century

122
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,639
and

123
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,320
everything starts from boris aguilin who

124
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
was the crypto funder

125
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,360
he fled to the us during the second

126
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
world war

127
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,600
and

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,400
sold his mechanical cypher machines at

129
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,639
the time to the army

130
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,560
then he went back to switzerland and

131
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
but the u.s intelligence was worried

132
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,560
because he was he kept updating

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
his machines they were quite good

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,960
so he sent a friend of him and a

135
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
well-known cryptographer william

136
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,479
friedman that is considered the

137
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,120
father of the cryptology in the us

138
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,919
to persuade eglin to sell his most

139
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,680
advanced machines only to us approved

140
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
countries

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,720
so

142
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440
in intelligence terms this is called a

143
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,639
denial operation so basically you want

144
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,720
to restrict

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
the technology you want you don't want

146
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,319
your adversaries being able to get

147
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,560
annulled on this technology

148
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,360
uh of course crypto was also receiving

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
some money for this

150
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,160
and

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
was also receiving some cash in order to

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,000
push the marketing of the machine so

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,440
that they could expand their market

154
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,680
so in in the timeline you see at the

155
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
bottom

156
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
there is the timeline of the whole

157
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
operation uh the

158
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,120
first it begins

159
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
around the middle 50s when there is this

160
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,000
gentleman agreement between friedman and

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,280
hagelin

162
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
then there is a turn

163
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,080
around the middle of the 60s as we will

164
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,680
see with an upgrade of the operation

165
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,800
then actually the b and a and the cia

166
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
takes over so basically they completely

167
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,199
control

168
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,520
the managing of the company

169
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,840
than just the cia so and each phase has

170
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,479
a different code name like spartan

171
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,800
thesaurus rubicon

172
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
and so on

173
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,520
so the actually the breakthrough moment

174
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,800
for the american intelligence came uh

175
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
around middle the middle of you know the

176
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
60s

177
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,840
when

178
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,440
there was a shift to electronic devices

179
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,919
because to adapt to the new technology

180
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,880
crypto aeg accepted

181
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,960
their help accepted the nsa help

182
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,479
and in the 67 they rolled out this new

183
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,800
electronic model that you see in the

184
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
picture

185
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,599
whose inner workings were designed by

186
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,759
the nsa

187
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,759
so as the same

188
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,520
cia report states the foreign government

189
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,919
at this point were paying

190
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,400
money to the us and the german

191
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,120
intelligence for having the

192
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,000
most secret communications read

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,639
by them and also by other governments

194
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
because this intelligence was then

195
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,759
shared at least with probably with the

196
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,280
five eyes alliance

197
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,199
because as i said before the first

198
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,840
machines were mechanical then it was the

199
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
upgrade to the electro electronic ones

200
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,559
and

201
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,640
and this was definitely

202
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,159
the moment when the operation changed

203
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,839
and

204
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,240
became uh

205
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,159
more active

206
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,958
so

207
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,880
of course the nsa uh didn't install a

208
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,399
backdoor in a

209
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,440
very

210
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,480
close

211
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,839
strict

212
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,880
meaning this is a quote from the

213
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,959
washington post so the language is not

214
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,920
actually technical but basically

215
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,279
they manipulated the algorithms so that

216
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,120
the nsa could more easily

217
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
break the code

218
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,360
in a shorter time of course they had

219
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
still to intercept

220
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
the communication

221
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,000
and then the company made a two version

222
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,279
of the his products the secure models

223
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,399
for friendly

224
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,560
governments and the alice

225
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
and the rickett systems for everyone

226
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,040
else

227
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
interesting detail

228
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,440
you see in the map the countries

229
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
italy was one of the countries who was

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,560
receiving the rigged systems

231
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,360
and together with spain

232
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,720
greece turkey so all close alice

233
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,720
actually of the us and the west germany

234
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,680
and this actually was a bond of

235
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,320
contention between the cia and the b and

236
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,279
because the germany the german

237
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,800
were more worried about the consequences

238
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,680
of you know this

239
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,720
with the alice uh

240
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,399
there are also interesting story about

241
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,959
the fact that uh the band there was also

242
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,800
very interested in the fact they were

243
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,040
making good money and they were paying

244
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,240
cash the cia in a garage like sort of

245
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,920
movie scenario

246
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
and the cia was much more interested in

247
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,320
the intelligence operation of course

248
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,360
but anyway in the 90s the

249
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
b and the bnd leaves

250
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,839
and

251
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,600
so the cia acquires i mean total control

252
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,399
of the company and also starts

253
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,440
buying

254
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,680
other crypto companies other crypto

255
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
firms

256
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
unfortunately the documents

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
don't say which ones so we don't have

258
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,560
the details we just know that we went on

259
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,640
buying some of them

260
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,360
and liquidating also some of the

261
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,279
competitors

262
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,959
uh

263
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,320
in the meantime it was the 90s and the

264
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
2000 and the encryption market was

265
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,240
changing

266
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
was moving from hardware to software

267
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,079
was there were a lot of products

268
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,279
proliferating all over the world as

269
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,399
this

270
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,519
survey

271
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,640
shows

272
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
and so

273
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,880
times changed and

274
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,399
at the end there were also a lot of

275
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,839
rumors

276
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,200
about crypto ag at this point actually

277
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,760
and so the cia sold

278
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,399
the company

279
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,959
so if we analyze the whole operation we

280
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,160
see we had the denial operation

281
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,480
trying to limit the spread of the

282
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,079
technology

283
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,440
then we have the active measures because

284
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,920
it becomes really a spine operation

285
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,360
where you

286
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,800
covertly rig a system and

287
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,920
spy

288
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,200
on in this case on the customers

289
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,079
and then you try the takeover of the

290
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,519
competition

291
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,839
that could

292
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,639
jeopardize your your operation and

293
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,279
the exit

294
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,320
so you basically gets out and

295
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
of course the

296
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,959
we have a technological shift

297
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,760
that you know gives you the opportunity

298
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
to to go from the denial operation to

299
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,079
the active measures and then you have

300
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,320
another technological shift

301
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,519
that makes the operation not worthwhile

302
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,639
anymore

303
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,480
and these are the two moments

304
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,480
defining moments of the whole process

305
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,600
talking about

306
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,279
going from the

307
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,519
hardware to the software market in

308
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,839
security

309
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,399
we

310
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,399
we can talk about another security

311
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,160
product another encryption product a

312
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,560
software in this case

313
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,880
uh for talking about this we we have to

314
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,680
start from uh

315
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,360
paul calder leroux

316
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,160
i don't know if you know him or many of

317
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,720
you know leroux could you just raise

318
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
your hand if you know

319
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
leroux

320
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,480
not so many few okay

321
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,800
so paul calderlero

322
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,680
i mean

323
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
it's a strange figure uh is a former

324
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,800
criminal uh cartel boss really a kingpin

325
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,760
uh drugs and weapons trafficker he has

326
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,200
been arrested and then sentenced to 35

327
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,560
years

328
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,480
he was involved in everything money

329
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,120
laundering dragon arms trafficking

330
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,680
organized crime everything he even

331
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,360
admitted to have arranged some murders

332
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,199
but before his criminal career and maybe

333
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,839
also during we don't know exactly

334
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
definitely before we know for sure

335
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,440
he was a very talented programmer

336
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
and

337
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,279
the

338
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,920
funny story someone even thinks that le

339
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,480
rue could be satoshi nakamoto

340
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,760
solo she calder leroux actually and of

341
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
course we know that there was a time

342
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,680
when each month you would have an

343
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,480
article pinpointing

344
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,199
satoshi nakamoto candidate so there are

345
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,560
many

346
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
is one of the many there are some

347
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,120
stories and some hints about this you

348
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,920
can find the articles and make your own

349
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,880
mind

350
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,480
about these arguments just but this is

351
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
not the main point here

352
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,399
the main point is that there is a

353
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,199
connection between leroux and truecrypt

354
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,360
which is a well-known software

355
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
because we know that leroux is

356
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,160
responsible for creating this open

357
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,880
source disk encryption platform called

358
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,120
e4m

359
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,440
encryption for the masses

360
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,360
he started building

361
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,120
it in the 1997.

362
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
of course it uh it was a software that

363
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,160
let you encrypt the hard drives or

364
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,399
conceal the existence of encrypted file

365
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,160
and he said that he wrote it from

366
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,440
scratch

367
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,150
and

368
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,279
[Music]

369
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,440
he released it for free

370
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,839
and it made the code available for

371
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,199
others he even wrote a sort of a

372
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,399
privacy manifesto at the time of course

373
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,639
we are at the end of the 90s so it's

374
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,440
really the time of the cypherpunks

375
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,920
and in this privacy manifesto it talks

376
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,079
about you know the battle for privacy

377
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,000
because we are losing this privacy in

378
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,560
the real world and so and so it even

379
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,120
talks about i know there is a need for

380
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,920
investigation for the criminality but we

381
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,160
also need the privacy it's interesting

382
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,759
to look it with the insight

383
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,959
so

384
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,040
leroux went on to work for a security

385
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
company secure star that later accused

386
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,040
him

387
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,440
of having incorporated some of this work

388
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,320
into e4m

389
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,120
and later there was a group of anonymous

390
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,720
developers

391
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,360
that who released

392
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,399
a new file encryption program called

393
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,839
truecrypt that was built on e4m

394
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,759
so there was a controversy with the

395
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,320
secure star because of this

396
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,639
so there was a first release then there

397
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,839
were a few changes another release

398
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,639
but the end the anonymous programmers

399
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,240
went on

400
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,560
with truecrypt maintained it

401
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,480
we still don't know who they are we

402
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,279
still know how they funded it

403
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,160
of course here in this uh text you can

404
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,399
see that the reference to e4m to

405
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,759
and

406
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,279
and so on

407
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,480
uh

408
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,680
interesting the secure star colleagues

409
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,920
suspected that leroux was part of the

410
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,680
truecrypt team

411
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,160
but they couldn't prove it

412
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,600
and

413
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,400
also

414
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,039
matthew green who is a well-known

415
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,199
cryptologist and computer science

416
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,559
professor

417
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,760
said that

418
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,240
yeah the origin of truecrypt has always

419
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,799
been very mysterious

420
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,599
and we don't know if it was

421
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,679
wrote it or others we just can't say

422
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,439
but we have to say that later on leroux

423
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,720
denied

424
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,280
denied this

425
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,000
anyway

426
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,720
then it was 2013

427
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,400
and we had the nsa gate remember snowden

428
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,000
revelations

429
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,440
the surveillance programs by the nsa and

430
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
of course also the efforts

431
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,559
by some intelligence agency

432
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,280
to

433
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,240
uh

434
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,200
to you know spy to collect uh traffic

435
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
but also to

436
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
weaken

437
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,200
security products or

438
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,720
encryption

439
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,520
so

440
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,080
some speculation arose about the

441
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,480
presence of a backdoor in truecrypt

442
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,520
and the fact that there was some mystery

443
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,200
about truecrypt of course didn't help

444
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,080
so a crowdfunding campaign was launched

445
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,960
in order to audit it and

446
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,840
there was matthew green again

447
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,679
um trying to to

448
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,559
lead

449
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,280
on this project

450
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,919
because as he said i would feel better

451
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,400
if i knew who the true crypt authors

452
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,120
were i mean it's not a crime to be

453
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
anonymous he said

454
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
but

455
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,960
since truecrypt is used by many people

456
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
for many important reasons we would like

457
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,080
to have a look at the code

458
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,400
and also there were some researchers

459
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,039
that had doubts about the binaries

460
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,320
and

461
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,480
yeah because the project didn't provide

462
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,039
deterministic bills so

463
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,120
you can yeah you know and

464
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,160
so

465
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,760
there was a researcher who actually

466
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,799
compiled it and answered no it's it's

467
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,480
fine but there is a there was a lot of

468
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,760
debate

469
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,720
and

470
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,080
articles about this

471
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,640
in the meantime the audit

472
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
the process of the audit the

473
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
crowdfunding the audio went on

474
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,480
but then we had a plot twist

475
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,000
because abruptly the truecrypt project

476
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
was shut down

477
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,600
in

478
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
2013 in the middle of the audit

479
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
and this didn't help with the

480
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
speculation of course i think matthew

481
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,480
green was really upset at the time

482
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,919
and

483
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,160
he said you know they they set the whole

484
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,200
thing on fire

485
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,679
maybe now uh

486
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,600
after what they have done today makes

487
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,760
impossible to go on with this audit uh

488
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,039
of course you know doing this now

489
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,200
will make people think that

490
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,159
there is some big evil vulnerability in

491
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,679
the code

492
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,000
and so

493
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,799
there was some pessimism at the moment

494
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,120
at the time and

495
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,159
also because yeah it was closed and

496
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,440
declared unsecured and you know it was

497
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,159
unexpected

498
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,000
but the audit went on

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,919
and at the end

500
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,480
the result was that

501
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,520
truecrypt was a well-designed piece of

502
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,159
software of crypto software with no

503
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,120
evidence of deliberate backdoors or any

504
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,760
severe design flow this is the final

505
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,360
result of the audit the website that was

506
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
uh that had been created is through

507
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,799
crypt audited yet could finally answer

508
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,080
yes

509
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,280
uh matthew green even wrote that

510
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,000
truecrypt was really unique a unique

511
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,320
piece of software and it was really a

512
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,679
pity that had been discontinued and

513
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,640
he was hopeful that someone else

514
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
would go on

515
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,080
so to summarize the the story with the

516
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,360
words of matthew green uh

517
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,880
leroux wrote the precursor the precursor

518
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,320
to truecrypt

519
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,200
then he became a kingpin

520
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,280
truecrypt was a fork of e4m

521
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,760
by made by anonymous authors

522
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,039
there were some problems new released

523
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,640
the authors went on they had funding

524
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,440
with there is no evidence leroux was

525
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,039
involved in this

526
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,440
even if he was using truecrypt

527
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,200
and of course of course the audit was

528
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,400
not about the authorship was just about

529
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,000
the software security

530
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,640
and then you you know that today we have

531
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,960
some forks we have like veracrypt which

532
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,240
is a fork

533
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,480
and so on so

534
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,880
final story

535
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
it's about vpns

536
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,200
vpns are a very controversial topic and

537
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,159
it's very difficult because every time

538
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,640
there are a lot of demands and a lot of

539
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,080
requests

540
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,039
by

541
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,799
users uh about vpns and it's very

542
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,280
difficult to give any recommendation

543
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,120
about this

544
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,679
and you know that the ancient greeks we

545
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,080
would say know yourself

546
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,880
but

547
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,200
we we should also add that you should

548
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,760
know in a very intimate way also your

549
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,159
vpn provider if you want really to use

550
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,000
the vpn

551
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
so the

552
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,640
just a few weeks ago there was this

553
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,120
story about the vpn consolidation

554
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,640
process

555
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
so basically we had

556
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,080
this former company called crossrider

557
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,440
that had a shady bad reputation

558
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,159
because third parties were using

559
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,440
its platform for ads and malware

560
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
distribution

561
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,320
and

562
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,039
the company then changed name became

563
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,640
cape technologies

564
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,080
and in the meantime they start acquiring

565
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,600
vpns so actually cyberghost then made

566
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,760
private internet access in the last

567
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,840
weeks then they bought one of the major

568
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,440
vpn providers which is express vpn

569
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,600
and also they bought a collection of vpn

570
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,400
review websites you know the websites

571
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
that give you

572
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,720
a ranking of the best vpns kind of the

573
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,320
conflict of interest i would say

574
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,880
the same days they were doing this and

575
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,200
acquiring

576
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,039
express vpn

577
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,559
it came out that their the expressvpn

578
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,400
cio

579
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,440
was involved in project raven

580
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,480
which for the ones you

581
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,919
of you you don't know is a mercenary

582
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,880
was a mercenary cyber spy unit of the

583
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,240
emirates that has been accused

584
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,520
of spying on journalists and activists

585
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,960
and so on and he the cio he actually had

586
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,679
legal problems in the u.s for this he

587
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,720
had to pay a big penalty and also you

588
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,640
know yet to cooperate with the fbi about

589
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
this

590
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,600
and this didn't help and in terms of

591
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,159
reaction by the users the two news

592
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,640
together if you look at the reaction the

593
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,760
user were really not happy about

594
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,520
all the old story and the whole

595
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,919
acquisition

596
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,039
and

597
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,400
but there was also an interesting

598
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,720
analysis about this made by a security

599
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,120
researcher called juan andrei

600
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,760
guerrerosad

601
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
who highlighted how the combination of a

602
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,039
malicious ad network and a vpn provider

603
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,000
is

604
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,640
especially dangerous because you can

605
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
profile specific user and also you can

606
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,480
manipulate their traffic and this

607
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,360
opens you know the way for tactical

608
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,520
network injections so basically you can

609
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,840
try and i stroganize

610
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,120
someone on you know on the fly

611
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,039
and

612
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,320
it also people are actually paying you

613
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,960
to run this you make money you make ad

614
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,200
revenue you sell their data and

615
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,799
occasionally

616
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,039
you may infect some specific special

617
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,120
customers on demand of somewhere else

618
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
so you can actually

619
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,840
yeah this thing obtaining making money

620
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
out of this it reminds me of the other

621
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,080
story also but anyway so there was a

622
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,760
worry about

623
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,559
the possibilities for targeted espionage

624
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,080
coming from this

625
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,480
type of

626
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,279
consolidations

627
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,320
so

628
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,240
going on

629
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,720
to the conclusions

630
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,000
i would say uh

631
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,400
when does the backdoor dreaming come

632
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,760
true

633
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,919
because yeah when it's a dream when it's

634
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,200
paranoia when it's real

635
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,200
so which are the enabling factors

636
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,480
that make backdoors more likely

637
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,679
that

638
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,960
and

639
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,799
maybe one is the technological shift if

640
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
you have a technological change a shift

641
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,880
in the technology you have you may have

642
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,640
an opportunity to insert yourself

643
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,440
and also if there is an ideological

644
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,720
drive

645
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,760
like

646
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,679
during the cold war

647
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,120
or maybe the war against terrorism or

648
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,840
things like this

649
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080
then if there you have a market

650
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
concentration a market dominance because

651
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,720
it makes

652
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
the effort

653
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,039
of trying to to get a backdoor

654
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,440
worthwhile if you dominate the market

655
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,240
and also if there is a strong market

656
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,480
demand because you don't want to do

657
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,960
something completely out of touch

658
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,200
with what's going on and if there is a

659
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,559
strong market demand everything you know

660
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
works better and you may even make money

661
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,720
out of this operation

662
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,039
and if other strategies to contain the

663
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,600
spread of the of the technology you

664
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,039
don't want

665
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,679
others use

666
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,039
others to use

667
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,919
fail so other containment strategies

668
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,279
fail so

669
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,600
it remains

670
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,080
manipulating or introducing

671
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,799
sort of vectors let's say

672
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,039
or maybe

673
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,039
other things or probably other things

674
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,919
that i didn't put i didn't think of i'm

675
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,039
sure

676
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,240
some of you have better ideas

677
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,600
and suggestions on this and if you have

678
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,360
i would love to hear them

679
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
and also this is really something i

680
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,120
would like to ask

681
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,279
here so what do you need to trust the

682
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
security product

683
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,840
because this is a question again that is

684
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,480
very is recurring in the last

685
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
years

686
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,360
and

687
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
is it

688
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,679
enough or you know okay to have an open

689
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,520
source code

690
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,840
to have audits made by

691
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,200
whom

692
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,279
if there is a transparent history of the

693
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,120
whole project if you know the developers

694
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,000
and they are not maybe anonymous or

695
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,960
if there is a wide community around it

696
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,000
if you know where the money comes from

697
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,799
or maybe you need also a market which is

698
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,600
diversified where you have competitors

699
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,200
and is not just a monopolist

700
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,279
or maybe you want an ideological

701
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,399
affinity to the project

702
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,880
and

703
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,399
yeah and

704
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,279
so i leave you with with these questions

705
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,919
and thank you

706
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
thank you very much for the talk uh are

707
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,240
there any questions from the audience

708
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
hi thank you for the talk

709
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,080
okay um i'm wondering what your

710
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,520
uh talked about the shifting paradigm

711
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,279
between uh about the 17

712
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,159
when

713
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,799
the nsa basically produced

714
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,039
crypto

715
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,840
as black boxes for example i'm thinking

716
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,960
about the

717
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,240
des

718
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,720
or ecc drbg and so on and nowadays where

719
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,919
crypto algorithms are the outcome of

720
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,600
open challenges

721
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,960
on the community

722
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
do you think this is sufficient to

723
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,320
prevent back doors

724
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,480
on algorithm or

725
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,640
is just one step

726
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
in

727
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,279
this direction

728
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,919
the the last algorithms for example aes

729
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,480
or the pod quantum algorithms are based

730
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,000
on challenges

731
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,200
so what do you think about it

732
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
i think that

733
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,960
like the there is

734
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,279
the paper i i

735
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,200
just

736
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,559
mentioned it sorry i was trying to go

737
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,200
yeah this paper it was actually it's

738
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,840
from the 2016 uh

739
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,039
so it's a little bit old 16 but

740
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,360
it's still good because it shows you

741
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,399
how

742
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,240
the market changed in a few years and it

743
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,200
actually became much more global

744
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,399
with a much more diversified

745
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,159
and

746
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,240
with a lot of uh

747
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,159
with a lot of actors from different

748
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,320
countries different different actors you

749
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,000
have also non-profit groups we have

750
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
companies we have

751
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,279
so uh and i think the idea uh

752
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,840
of the authors is that this helps

753
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,720
against uh you know

754
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,480
this type of risk

755
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,600
of course

756
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,320
because uh it's not just one country

757
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,679
controlling

758
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,039
a specific technology or specific

759
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,399
product

760
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,240
and

761
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,600
but of course we know that there had

762
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,760
been a lot of talks about different type

763
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,200
of backdoors

764
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,279
in the last years so

765
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,760
if a couple of years ago there was this

766
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,399
statement by

767
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,640
some of the major governments it was

768
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,880
like almost more or less the five

769
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,399
alliance so

770
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,640
us uk australia but probably also japan

771
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,120
in this case and they were like asking

772
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,559
for

773
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,440
a way to read

774
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,840
encrypted communications so of course

775
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,720
for them the concern is the spread of

776
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,120
end-to-end encryption to major platforms

777
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,200
like facebook for instance

778
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,399
or so of course there is this debate now

779
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,200
but in terms of having

780
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,240
a diversified offer

781
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,320
that prevents you

782
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,919
especially if you know

783
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,760
what you're talking about

784
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,840
yeah i think we are better positioned

785
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,080
now

786
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,559
i would like to ask

787
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,600
what do you think about

788
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,440
united kingdom

789
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
now relying on

790
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
avos amazon web services

791
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,760
to

792
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,159
protect their secret data about

793
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,840
intelligence

794
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,880
and

795
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,120
if you think that there will be some

796
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,960
kind of problems about security and

797
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,200
i don't know if you think it's

798
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,039
secure or not

799
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,360
to rely on a

800
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,200
company like amazon

801
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,159
to

802
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,039
such important things

803
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,600
of course there is a strong connection

804
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,000
between some of these companies and some

805
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,559
governments because we have seen it

806
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,360
after with we have seen it with the

807
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,600
snowden revolution in the u.s of course

808
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,000
that was with strong connection

809
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,640
and even if some of these companies

810
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,519
actually

811
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,600
after that trying to distance themselves

812
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,760
we still have a lot of close connection

813
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,720
between

814
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,000
military

815
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,480
for instance and these

816
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,720
tech companies

817
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,039
amazon of course is one of them but we

818
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,039
had also other companies

819
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,279
so i guess it really depends uh

820
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,240
and these are american companies so

821
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
i think the problem is if you are not

822
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,880
the american government or maybe the uk

823
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,559
government that has a special relation

824
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,600
with the

825
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,960
u.s but if i was a european government i

826
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,239
think this

827
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,158
i mean i would see it as a problem

828
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,599
uh

829
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,480
during the first quarter of the

830
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,280
of this year of

831
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,760
2021 i think so yeah this year

832
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,639
the europe released a document

833
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,800
uh saying that

834
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,879
europe basically wanted

835
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,918
the some back doors or something like

836
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,040
that in

837
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,320
cryptographic algorithms in a way to

838
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,480
protect not only the privacy of people

839
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,000
but also

840
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,679
the security the the actual security of

841
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,839
uh of the

842
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,520
the security of people as in like

843
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,199
physical security

844
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,879
in case of

845
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,760
uh terroristic attempts so what do you

846
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,560
think about europe asking

847
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,119
to put vector vectors in

848
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,200
cryptographic algorithms do you think

849
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,839
it's fair or

850
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,640
i think that europe doesn't have a clear

851
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,520
position on that i think

852
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
because we had actually different

853
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
positions and some of them were really

854
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,440
more endorsing a strong encryption for

855
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,960
security

856
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,920
so but there are

857
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
especially the positions some

858
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,800
governments

859
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,200
they would like a more

860
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,359
proactive

861
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,599
attitude on this for

862
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,160
national security reasons at least what

863
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,359
they say

864
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,880
so there are

865
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,640
at the moment i would see there are some

866
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,400
conflicting

867
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,720
positions in europe about this

868
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,040
and

869
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,160
we also because we have a very complex

870
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,680
government

871
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
governance architecture in europe which

872
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,960
doesn't make easy to understand exactly

873
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,880
what is the position of europe on this

874
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,599
but

875
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,280
it's definitely something

876
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,000
that needs to be monitored because they

877
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,760
could introduce

878
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,240
things that could

879
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,520
weaken

880
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,960
the

881
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,240
um the idea of the encryption and

882
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
security at least from the cyber

883
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,440
security standpoint okay thank you

884
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,040
actually i have one question and

885
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,320
it is it is more about ethics because uh

886
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
uh like in the last two years two big

887
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,200
papers came out in cryptography

888
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,359
one of them is called really how to

889
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,680
backdoor a cypher and

890
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,520
it is uh

891
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,240
an example on how you can create a

892
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,560
backdoor cipher that

893
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,119
basically cannot be detected

894
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,240
um

895
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,040
how

896
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,599
ethic is to publish something like this

897
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,079
in your opinion i mean if i as a

898
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,000
researcher

899
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,800
give away to backdoor cipher for a

900
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,800
product to some malicious company

901
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,680
is this right or i shouldn't i publish

902
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,480
something like this

903
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,800
this is a

904
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,359
difficult question i i would say that as

905
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,079
long as you are doing a research

906
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,160
you should be free to do any kind of

907
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,880
research on these topics really because

908
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
also because you never know i mean if

909
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,000
you are not doing that someone else is

910
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,520
doing it anyway and you don't know how

911
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,119
you're going to apply

912
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,119
so it's still better to do research on

913
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,079
this

914
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,720
the issue is later is not when you do

915
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,480
the research the issue is when you let

916
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,760
the market use this type of technologies

917
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,119
in

918
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,400
in a completely unregulated way

919
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,800
and as we have seen with some

920
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,560
surveillance technologies in the last

921
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,880
years so i think it's more a political

922
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,280
issue than a science research issue

923
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,240
thank you

924
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,959
so okay

925
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,799
you
