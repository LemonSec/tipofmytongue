1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,880
so i'm very pleased to be here and the

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,720
first first of all i want to thank you

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,040
the organizers the organizer of the

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,719
conference

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,280
i'm daniel duchy a data scientist and a

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,599
security researcher at on tizen

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,880
consulting

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,920
and today i will discuss how ai

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
artificial intelligence and in

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
particular machine learning can help in

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,800
detecting cyber threats

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,400
first of all i want to start

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
by talking about how

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,120
malware evolved along the years

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
and in particular how artificial

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,520
intelligence and machine learning can be

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,760
applied to cyber security

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,840
then we will see

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
some common techniques used by the

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,719
attackers

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,399
and two examples of famous malware

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,640
we will see the wannacry ransomware and

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,360
the astaroth malware family

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,079
and in particular how this malware can

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,879
be

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,520
effectively detected using a machine

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
learning approach

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,159
then we will conclude this talk by

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,040
talking about a little bit of offensive

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
ai

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,119
i would like to start this this

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,000
presentation by showing this image that

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,280
in my opinion is very representative of

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,840
how the situation has gone wild from the

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,920
2000s indeed in the past

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,960
the

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
the the malware

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
were hunted down by lots of security

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,079
researchers they were very few and

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,840
basically they were developed to prove

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,280
something

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,439
for example that they

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,600
the malware rotors could

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,360
for example annoy users or rather

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,759
they want to prove that computer system

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,560
at the time but still they are insecure

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,079
then after the 2000s we have witnessed

48
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,280
to

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,399
the

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,960
development of very complex and

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
sophisticated malware that takes the

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,840
name of super malware like for example

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
you may have

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,280
heard about of saxonet doku and flame

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,440
later as i mentioned before in this

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,760
presentation we will see an example not

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,160
of a supermarket but

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,720
a malware that was very effective

59
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,800
in infecting

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
in infecting more than 150 countries

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
worldwide

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,560
so as i said the uh um in the previous

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
slide that the 2000 the mark the the

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
transition from malware

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,239
with the either noble or less noble

66
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,080
purposes to

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
actually malware that now are able to

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,160
recruit computers in a botnet in order

69
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,680
to attack companies and organizations

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
but that can they can be also used for

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,879
industrial

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,360
virtual espionage

73
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,680
indeed emblematic is the case for

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,560
example of the chinese attackers that

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
were were able to

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
exfiltrate a

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,360
secret dead about def 35 strike fighter

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
jet from the u.s subcontractor locket

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,720
martin and in the figure we can actually

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,280
see how the two chinese jets

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,159
are

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,400
curiously very similar to the f35 so we

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,720
are talking about the j-20 and the j-31

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,239
chinese

85
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,200
fighter jets so we can see uh

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,920
we have seen an example on how

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
actually

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
industrial virtual espionage can be very

89
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,760
productive and can produce actually

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,799
a real damage to in this case the

91
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,040
military sector

92
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,599
malware in the recent years

93
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,120
have also used to attack to spy on

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
activists

95
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,319
and so in in the last year we have uh

96
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,000
we have seen that

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
single malicious software orders

98
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
basically

99
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,560
are organized are organizing in cyber

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
criminal organizations that are

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,440
structured as a companies

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,320
and these cyber criminal companies

103
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
offer services for example malware as a

104
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,720
service

105
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
that is a term that indicates the lease

106
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
of hardware and software in order to

107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,919
perform a cyber attack

108
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,600
so for example a

109
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
customer can campaign in order to launch

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,880
a cyberattacks to

111
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,680
its competitors

112
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,919
so given the huge amount of data that

113
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,199
the security appliances

114
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
have to process and the failure of

115
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,320
classic approaches

116
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
uh for example the

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,039
signature base that are used by endpoint

118
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,960
antiviruses

119
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,240
this iterator of security platform

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,880
should be at least that analysis

121
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
processes should be automated as much as

122
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,000
possible and security analysts should be

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,960
supported by tools that enable

124
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,080
themselves

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,680
to identify

126
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,440
to identify possible cyber threats

127
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,199
in these tasks

128
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,400
artificial intelligence is able to

129
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,280
support their analysis

130
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,160
and in order to spot

131
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
suspicious the events that are worth to

132
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,280
be investigated

133
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,639
so i have some expertise actually in in

134
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,320
the machine learning

135
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
field

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,800
and now

137
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
we will discuss how

138
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
machine learning can be applied to cyber

139
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,080
security machine learning is a branch of

140
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,199
artificial intelligence and

141
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,840
allows an application to perform

142
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,639
a task without being explicitly

143
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,520
programmed to do so in order to do this

144
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,560
it builds a mathematical model

145
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,080
and based on data samples

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,120
mainly

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,199
machine learning approaches

148
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,520
differ from statistical ones because

149
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,000
they are able to provide more accurate

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
predictions

151
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
with respect to statistical approaches

152
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,639
but this comes at the cost of

153
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,759
less

154
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,000
interpretable mathematical models and

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,759
these in some cases

156
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,560
in case these models have to be analyzed

157
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,400
is a problem actually

158
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,639
and as i said before

159
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
they need the

160
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
data samples for creating internally

161
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,520
a model representations

162
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,360
machine learning driven investigations

163
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,840
can mainly rely on two different

164
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,319
approaches that are supervised and

165
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,319
unsupervised learning and then we can

166
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,400
combine also these support these

167
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,560
approaches to obtain semi supervised

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,479
approaches

169
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,199
in the next slides we will see uh some

170
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
example of super of supervised and

171
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,720
unsupervised learning

172
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,199
a typical example of a classic of

173
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,840
supervised supervised learning is the

174
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,039
classification it is defined as the task

175
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,840
of assigning an observation to a

176
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,199
specific class on the basis or label

177
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,080
data

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
so for example we can think about that

179
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,199
we have a classifier that uh

180
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,639
scene

181
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,160
that sees bytes sent by a monitoring

182
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,360
machine

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,680
and after a specific process that we we

184
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
will say in a moment we will see in a

185
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,400
moment

186
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,919
you can classify these as a legi as a

187
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,800
legit data transfer rather than

188
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
an attempt of data exfiltration

189
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
analogously

190
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,000
http traffic can be analyzed by a

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
machine learning classifier in order to

192
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
establish

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,639
if

194
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,280
in it there are suspicious

195
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,520
requests or responses

196
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
or

197
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,319
instead the

198
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,800
all the http traffic is legitimate

199
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,080
on the right we can see an example

200
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,039
of of classification in particular a

201
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,440
binary classification

202
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,679
in which the objective of the classifier

203
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,679
is to classify instances as blue or red

204
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,958
and the mainly the objective also of of

205
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,399
the classifiers to find an hyperplane

206
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,200
that well separates the two instances

207
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,399
this process takes the name of training

208
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
while in normal operation of the

209
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
classifier

210
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,480
a new instance is given an input to the

211
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
classifier itself

212
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,040
and

213
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,040
the classifier has to decide if if

214
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,920
it belongs to the red class rather than

215
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,640
to the blue one

216
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
instead a typical example of

217
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,160
unsupervised learning is the clustering

218
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
is the process of grouping similar

219
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,920
observation

220
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,040
and so

221
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,240
let's assume for example of having a dns

222
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,320
query uh we can using we can use a

223
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,160
clustering approach in order to

224
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,959
establish if this will this query is

225
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,160
more similar to legit queries performed

226
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,720
in the network rather than

227
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,680
is

228
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,120
seen more similar to suspicious queries

229
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
in the figure we can see on the left for

230
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
example that original and pressure data

231
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,040
are organized in three different

232
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,320
clusters

233
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,760
by using

234
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,320
one of the most notable and

235
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,600
used

236
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,880
algorithms in machine learning for the

237
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,959
clearly unsupervised learning that is

238
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,120
called the k-means algorithm

239
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,360
while on on the right we can see a

240
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,880
different type of clustering technique

241
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
that is called the hierarchical

242
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,959
clustering in which a single instances

243
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,200
instead can can be organized into a

244
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,680
energy

245
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,800
this slide instead at least

246
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
uh uh

247
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,880
examples of common techniques that we

248
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,560
have spot

249
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
into the wild used by

250
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,920
by malware

251
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,760
and

252
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,560
that can be used also uh

253
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
in different phases of the of the

254
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,959
attacks and can be used to penetrate

255
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,320
systems

256
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,279
clearly this list is not exhaustive and

257
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,120
uh i highlighted in red the ones that we

258
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,800
will see uh into detail uh by making

259
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,160
example of real malwares that

260
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
that

261
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,920
have been able to infect

262
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
lots of lots of

263
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
machines in lots of countries

264
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,760
i want to introduce you

265
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,480
the

266
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,200
the

267
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,959
around somewhere maybe

268
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,399
uh for sure many of you have already i

269
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,640
have already heard about that

270
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,120
it has been attributed to the la serious

271
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
group that is a north korean

272
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,240
state-sponsored uh threat actors that is

273
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
active uh that has been active since

274
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,800
2009

275
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
uh it has been responsible this uh

276
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
threat uh threat actor for many

277
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,920
disruptive attacks

278
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,120
so also in this case you you may know

279
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,839
the

280
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,839
wiper attack that has been carried out

281
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,480
against sunny pictures in which uh

282
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,600
several private data were leaked

283
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,279
publicly regarding emails personal

284
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,120
employee information

285
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,519
executive salaries

286
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,560
copies for example of sony movies but

287
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,519
also plans for sila released movies

288
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,720
coming back

289
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
again to wannacry

290
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,040
its samples use mainly two techniques

291
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,079
uh

292
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
actually three but the one that are

293
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,639
detectable using a machine learning

294
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,760
approach are two and they are the dga

295
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
that stands for domain generation

296
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,880
algorithm

297
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
and consisting

298
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,639
generating domains by using a program

299
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,800
and contacting then the command and

300
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,519
control sector using this domain

301
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,320
and the classic cost emporscan

302
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,519
the wannacry ransomware based the base

303
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,240
is is our activity on a microsoft

304
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,720
implementation of

305
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
on an exploit of microsoft

306
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,760
implementation of the server message

307
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
block protocol that is called ethernet

308
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
blue

309
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,880
this is an exploit that is tool to be

310
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,279
developed by the us national security

311
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,639
agency

312
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,440
and

313
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,399
is also to be

314
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,120
used several years before being leaked

315
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,959
by another

316
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,600
track doctor that is called the shadow

317
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,839
group

318
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,920
the first thing that the wannacry

319
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,440
malware tries to do is to attempt to

320
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
contact a kid switch domain in order to

321
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,920
establish if

322
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,560
it has to proceed with the infection and

323
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
with encryption of all the disks

324
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,600
of the machine

325
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
example of the key switch domains are

326
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,800
reported in the slide the first uh

327
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,320
small dot

328
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
and the deeper investigation have also

329
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
revealed that

330
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
these domains

331
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,240
this infection actually uh involve

332
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,040
more

333
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
machines that are more active in the

334
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,160
nectars

335
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,120
in the network since this means that

336
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,320
more science machine in the network that

337
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
do not perform

338
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,160
any activity um

339
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
are less probable to be

340
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,399
to be actually infected by the wannacry

341
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,160
run somewhere infected machines that are

342
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,320
not able to contact these

343
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,720
kids which domains start gathering

344
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,399
information on the other devices

345
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,240
present in the network and this is

346
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,639
called the reconnaissance phase

347
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,680
and

348
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,040
in parallel these this branson were

349
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,360
start encrypting data

350
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,199
on the disk of the infected machine

351
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,760
basically the recognition

352
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,959
consists in scanning

353
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,480
random ip addresses we are talking about

354
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
25 vp address per second

355
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,560
looking for

356
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,880
open tcp 445 parts because this is the

357
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,760
the part that is used by the smb

358
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,199
services so

359
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,399
uh it's normal that in order to exploit

360
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
this service the wanakara ransomware

361
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,839
tries to

362
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,279
uh detect which machines have this uh

363
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,720
port opened

364
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
uh clearly you can understand well that

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,279
uh

366
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,959
contacting uh about 25 ip address per

367
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,839
second this allows to

368
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,079
spread the infection very rapidly and

369
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,399
these explain not so well why the

370
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
infection is propagated in more than 150

371
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,880
countries

372
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
so once

373
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,959
one or more machine in the network are

374
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,000
found to be a fun to have the tcp 445

375
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
port to open

376
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,120
then again

377
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,279
the eternal blue exploit is run

378
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,800
also in this case

379
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,839
the recognitions and exploitation phase

380
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,240
are run in parallel

381
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
now we can see how

382
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,959
these phases of the attacks

383
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,519
can be actually detected by a machine

384
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,360
learning approach

385
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
but before i i just want you

386
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,759
to give you

387
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,519
an intuition and

388
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,800
and a fact

389
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,519
namely deeper investigation

390
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,639
had found that kill switch domains

391
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,360
seems to be obtained

392
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,839
from someone that has meshed a few keys

393
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,720
on the upper rows of a keyboard and this

394
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
some somehow

395
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,320
suggested by the

396
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,800
distance between characters in kill

397
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
switch domains the figures report

398
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,639
clearly an example of one of them

399
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,240
and also by the character frequency

400
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,680
however

401
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,560
fortunately for us and from for the ones

402
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,519
that use machine learning approaches kid

403
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,519
switch domains look like as

404
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,040
algorithmically generated still

405
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,079
and

406
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,240
we can use a machine learning approach

407
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,520
in order to detect this kind of

408
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,439
contacted domains

409
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,480
so

410
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,799
the first thing that a machine learning

411
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,000
approach

412
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,799
can do is to try to

413
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,160
detect and identify which are the peaks

414
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,240
of activity of the machines

415
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,359
since

416
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,720
we have just said that one acrylic

417
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,319
infection

418
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,559
involves a machine that are more active

419
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,919
in the network

420
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,280
so

421
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,480
we can think about of on training a

422
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,280
classifier that is able to uh

423
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
distinguish between a normal activity

424
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
and instead

425
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,960
a peak of the of the activities of the

426
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,799
machine

427
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,640
in particular we

428
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,360
we at eyes on a found that is particular

429
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,320
particularly successful to combine a

430
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,400
machine learning approach

431
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,840
and

432
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,160
also a statistical approach in order to

433
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,480
maximize the accuracy produced by the

434
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,760
two

435
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,679
and

436
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,120
as statistical indicators for example we

437
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
can use

438
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,640
the one that models the deviation from

439
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,600
machine

440
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,280
from the

441
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,000
usual machine activities

442
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,880
once

443
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
by combining this machine learning

444
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,320
approach and a statistical indicator

445
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,919
we can

446
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,360
apply again a clustering phase in which

447
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
each one of the domain

448
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
containing these peaks

449
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,000
is clustered

450
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
against the group that is more similar

451
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,000
to the instance itself

452
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,240
so this means that at the end of the

453
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,919
clustering phase

454
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
we have queries that are legitimate

455
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,120
clusters representing legitimate queries

456
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,919
while on the other hand we will have

457
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,360
potential and possible

458
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,120
algorithmically generated domains

459
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,440
the last phase is the one in which we

460
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,799
analyze

461
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,679
both the cluster characteristics but

462
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,280
also the lex

463
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
we perform a lexical analysis on the

464
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
domains contained

465
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,000
in these in these potential

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,280
algorithmically generated domains

467
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,559
and there is another consideration

468
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,720
that a security analyst

469
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,160
or a data scientist can verify if

470
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,120
one of these domains have been actually

471
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,799
resolved

472
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,480
by the

473
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,280
the dns of the network because in this

474
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,880
case this means

475
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,320
that

476
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,039
the malware has been already able to

477
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,440
contact the common control center to

478
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,960
receive partner information about

479
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,000
the attack or even to exfiltrate data so

480
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,600
it's very

481
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,080
it's a very critical level

482
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,039
it's a very critical issue

483
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,640
in a similar manner we can detect both

484
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,679
ost imports cancer using

485
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,760
a similar approach that we have already

486
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,960
presented

487
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,280
but now we can focus in particular on a

488
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,720
specific

489
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,280
connection for example we can analyze

490
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,360
flags of connection in order to

491
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,200
detect the specific cases of

492
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,559
us discovery and port scans for example

493
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,520
tcp and udp pings

494
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,200
tcp hackpings and so on

495
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,480
but now instead of domains we have to

496
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,440
collect another type of features

497
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,840
so for example we can

498
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
collect the number of destination

499
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,880
machines and ports that are reached in a

500
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,440
specific time interval

501
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,679
outliers that are computer as we have

502
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,640
seen before now instead represent and

503
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,080
describe

504
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,559
likely scanning activities

505
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,320
so we have basically seen how uh using

506
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,480
these machine learning techniques is

507
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,240
possible to detect detect a ransomware

508
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,520
like wannacry but not all needs we can

509
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,000
actually detect all the ransomware that

510
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,159
behaves and all the malware actually

511
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,880
that behaves like wannacry indeed it's

512
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,280
very common for malwares as you may know

513
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,000
to perform a recognition phase

514
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,799
and also to contact command and control

515
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,400
center by using

516
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,480
these algorithmically generated malwares

517
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,000
now we can

518
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,039
we can instead see another example a

519
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,120
famous example

520
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,760
of malware sample that are that belongs

521
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,320
to the astaroth malware families they

522
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,679
are basically

523
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,960
uh trojans and information sealers

524
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,400
they expect information about emails

525
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,120
e-commerce banking accounts

526
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,520
and they attacked the

527
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,760
companies in europe and latin america

528
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,640
since late 2017.

529
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,400
in the last july

530
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,640
new samples have actually been

531
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
distributed using a masspang campaign

532
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
through mails

533
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,799
that contained an infected link

534
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,080
disinfectaline linked one successed

535
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,400
and executed a compressed

536
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,360
powershell script

537
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,760
it started basically

538
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,640
the infection in different stages the

539
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,280
first thing that this kind of malwares

540
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,000
do

541
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,960
is to create a support file

542
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
that specifies a command and control

543
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
domain

544
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,840
then

545
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,559
this command control domain is contacted

546
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,320
to download

547
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,559
a javascript source code

548
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,440
that in turn download the other

549
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,320
malicious dynamic libraries and a

550
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,799
compiler for guaranteeing persistence

551
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,440
actually they downloaded the dynamic

552
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,919
libraries are the ones responsible for

553
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,960
extracting sensitive information that

554
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,320
are later

555
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
exfiltrated to either predator mind or

556
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,000
algorithmically again generated

557
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,280
malicious domains so we can see that

558
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,960
there exists

559
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
another but there exists also others

560
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,679
obviously uh families on malware that

561
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,640
perform dga to contact the command and

562
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,480
control centers

563
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,799
then the communication with these common

564
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,080
control centers are both encrypted

565
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
and in clear

566
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,080
we will start seeing the case in which

567
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,960
these communications are uh in clear and

568
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,799
again how it is possible to detect

569
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,120
this the these techniques using a

570
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,039
machine learning approach

571
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:53,919
so

572
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,120
the communication nuclear used uh uh the

573
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,960
conversion silver dns technique as

574
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,720
maybe one some of you may may know a

575
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,960
cover channel is a technique to

576
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,000
communicate transfer or exfiltrate data

577
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,320
using different protocols and in this

578
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,279
case

579
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,720
dns

580
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,840
after having obviously infected a

581
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,480
machine in a network

582
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,200
in the figure we can see some example of

583
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
uh

584
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,720
covert channel dns that are performed by

585
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,919
a sample

586
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:28,880
of the

587
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,600
of the astaroth family and also in this

588
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,159
case we can use machine learning to try

589
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,440
to detect

590
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
uh

591
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
queries like we have seen uh in the

592
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,400
previous slide but also in this slide

593
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,840
we can use now uh

594
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,400
um supervised learning approach namely a

595
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
classifier

596
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,720
that takes in input that extract

597
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,640
actually

598
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,880
particular features such

599
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,799
such for example

600
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,679
the upper lower case ratio or the number

601
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,400
letters ratio of dns queries

602
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,039
you can analyze also those name length

603
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,480
and

604
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,720
the length of each

605
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,679
part

606
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,720
of the

607
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,880
of the query that has been performed

608
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,000
clearly again this list of features is

609
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,480
not is not exhaustive

610
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,960
and you can add this as

611
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
many features as you want

612
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,039
that are actually relevant to the

613
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,640
classification

614
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,240
so we can

615
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,600
we can use

616
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,440
a classifier to that is trained on

617
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,679
legitimate queries

618
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,279
and then

619
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,799
once

620
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,480
a new instance of the dns query arrives

621
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,400
the um the classifier can can say if it

622
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,080
is anomalous or legitimate based on the

623
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,039
samples of legitimate queries that he

624
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,559
has already

625
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,240
analyzed and has been trained

626
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,360
at this point again we

627
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,520
we use we combine a machine learning

628
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
approach with a statistical one

629
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,880
and so we add the some information we

630
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,520
combined some anomaly indicators

631
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,200
uh to the uh classification results so

632
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,240
for example you can take

633
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,799
the um you can measure the number of

634
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,520
unique request hosts names to emper

635
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,559
domain

636
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,159
if it's i clearly this is suspicious

637
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,600
in a similar

638
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,158
manner

639
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,080
a query that is a high entropy is

640
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,200
suspicious because it doesn't follow

641
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,240
the

642
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,159
the distribution of the language and so

643
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,840
on for example

644
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,000
you can measure also the distance of

645
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,320
monograms and bigrams distribution of

646
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,679
the query

647
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
from

648
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,080
for example the english dictionary and

649
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,880
how far are from them

650
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,640
all these indicators

651
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
clearly allow

652
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,039
to decide the suspicious queries

653
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,440
detected by the classifier is actually

654
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,640
malicious or not

655
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,760
then

656
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,799
i want to give you

657
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,520
just some ideas

658
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,320
on how it is possible to detect

659
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,640
anomalies in encrypted in encrypted

660
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,799
communication always using machine

661
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,840
learning

662
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,559
unfortunately i cannot share much of

663
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,559
details about this because we will see

664
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,360
in the next slide that this work will be

665
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,799
presented to another conference anyway

666
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,440
we are able to use a machine learning

667
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,480
approach

668
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,840
by uh

669
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,960
by analyzing encrypted traffic and

670
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,559
extracting

671
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,279
information from

672
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,360
ssl tls metadata and also by

673
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,919
information contained in the

674
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,279
authentication certificate exchange

675
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,159
we with a server using a secure

676
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,320
communications

677
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,840
in particular

678
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,399
we don't combine

679
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,919
now the

680
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,600
machine learning techniques with a

681
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,799
statistical approach but we use

682
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,159
a j3s that very recently

683
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:18,960
uh

684
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
have been used by the lots of uh

685
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,360
security platform in order to

686
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,799
fingerprint suspicious communication so

687
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,279
the objective was of these ashes is to

688
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,159
fingerprint clients that establish

689
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,880
a secure connection with

690
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,399
servers for example located outside

691
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,200
the

692
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,679
monitoring network itself

693
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,080
as i mentioned before

694
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,720
unfortunately we i cannot disclose some

695
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
so many detail because this work has

696
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,320
been published

697
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,279
uh to the

698
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:58,320
ssaci conference of 2021 and we will

699
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,559
present this work

700
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,520
in few days from now

701
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,320
so up to now we have seen

702
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,600
a different example of how machine

703
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,360
learning can be executed for defensive

704
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,559
purposes

705
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,760
i want to mention about that clearly

706
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,679
there exists some attackers that start

707
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,799
using

708
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,440
artificial intelligence for

709
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
offensive purposes

710
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,240
so i just want in this slide that i

711
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,200
reported just a toy example but

712
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,159
that can give you an idea on how is

713
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,440
possible to

714
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,799
mislead the

715
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,240
machine learning trained classifier so

716
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,720
in the picture we we can see

717
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,440
different images of athletes and

718
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,360
hollywood doctors that

719
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
are correctly

720
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,080
classified by

721
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,000
an image classifier

722
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,399
with a high accuracy that

723
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,240
is reported

724
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,960
above the pictures in

725
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,520
near clean examples

726
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
then

727
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,679
the attacker instead put some eyeglasses

728
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,000
on the pictures itself

729
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,880
so we can see that uh

730
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,159
we have that for example mega ion is

731
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,279
classifier by

732
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,440
on these examples

733
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,960
uh in zac efron so we can see how

734
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,840
a

735
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,960
classifier that works correctly without

736
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,120
on the images without any alterations

737
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
actually

738
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,760
now performs pretty bad

739
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,799
on

740
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,559
on samples provided by the attacker

741
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,080
i talk about eyeglasses actually they

742
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,440
are

743
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,880
of colors

744
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
that allows to mislead the completely

745
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,760
the classifier in order to not be able

746
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,960
to recognize which is the person in the

747
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,000
image

748
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,200
so just to make a parallelism to what we

749
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,039
have seen

750
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,399
up to now

751
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,760
the attacker can change the pattern that

752
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
he used to communicate with the command

753
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,440
and control centers

754
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,799
how it generates for example

755
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,120
the domains of the command and control

756
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,240
center itself in order to evade

757
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,039
the

758
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,760
the the machine learning algorithms that

759
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,640
uh who are responsible for detecting

760
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,399
this kind of techniques however the last

761
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,840
message that uh that i want to to give

762
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,120
is that if these features and

763
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,640
are chosen properly and they are robust

764
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,159
they are very

765
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,440
difficult

766
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,679
and uh

767
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,399
maybe impossible to evade for an

768
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,880
attacker so the attacker should be very

769
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,039
very smart in order to evade

770
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,000
and not always is possible to do this

771
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,120
because

772
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,279
everything run on some network

773
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,559
infrastructures was there will are

774
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,039
in some cases fixed

775
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,440
so this slides uh uh concludes my

776
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,360
presentation i i

777
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,279
