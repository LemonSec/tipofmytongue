00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,360
welcome to biohackers the invisible

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,960
threat

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,279
my name is leno i'm part of the global

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,720
solutions enablement team and one of

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
cyber arts white hat hackers i'm a

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,160
global security speaker and i've been

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,039
with cyberark for just about seven years

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,720
i've been an i.t professionally for over

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,240
20 years and roles ranging from

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,479
programmer to systems architect

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,840
i've been breaking into computers since

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,000
the commodore 64 days and spent a large

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
amount of my time in my youth as a black

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,160
or a gray hat hacker

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,840
i'm professionally trained as well as

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,200
come by a lot of my knowledge by

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,039
practical application

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,120
i'm very active on social media and i

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,399
invite everyone to reach out over

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,239
linkedin and check out my github and my

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,760
youtube channels for more security

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
related content i'd like to start this

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,480
presentation today by asking a really

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
easy question what does a cyborg look

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,719
like

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,199
when you hear the word cyborg what comes

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,479
to mind maybe a terminator or star wars

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,400
or star trek

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
everyone who knows the definition will

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,159
probably have a vision in their head and

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,360
i'd be willing to bet that it's all

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,159
shiny and to some extent robot looking

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,759
well i hate to pop the bubble on that

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,840
but it's just not the case

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
cyborgs are not only on the movie

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,759
screens anymore they walk among us and

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,280
you may be friends with one and just

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,119
don't know it

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,880
these are my hands

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
i'm a biohacker in the truest sense of

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,280
the word i am not only an augmented

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,280
human with microchips in my hands but

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
i'm also a white hat hacker i am a

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,520
hacker that has modified my body to take

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
advantage of available technology to

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,479
turn myself into the attack vector

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,399
i'm going to explain what my current

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,159
chips are as well as giving you a road

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,439
map on what i'm looking to do to

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,280
continue my journey in becoming more

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,119
than human

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,280
the x-rays like i said above these are

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
my hands and i have the following

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,439
capabilities with my current implants

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
i have what is called a flex next this

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,439
is a very long range nfc rfid chip

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,759
i have a next implant it's the same

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,239
exact chip just with a much smaller

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,680
range

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,879
i have the flex m1 magic this chip

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,200
allows me to emulate any number of older

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
access cards from public transit to

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,200
membership tokens to physical access

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,239
i have a vivokey spark2 this is actually

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,239
a cryptobionic chip that can perform

67
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,720
strong cryptographic functions

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
since the time this x-ray was taken i

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,239
actually have two additional implants i

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,400
have what is called a flex e m

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,319
this allows me to emulate most of the

72
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,720
popular physical access cards including

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,840
the prox card two and three as well as

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
hid andala pyramid and just a ton more

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,360
and finally i have a titan biomagnet

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,680
this is a magnet that's been implanted

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
that actually allows me to be able to

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,879
feel electromagnetic currents

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,519
uh i'm also implanting a newer version

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,120
of the vivokey with the ability to

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,920
incorporate java cards and java

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,159
processes and finally i'm also in

83
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,280
negotiations to safely encapsulate a peg

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
leg which we will be discussing a little

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,599
bit later in this talk

86
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,560
so

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
augmented humans are not science fiction

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,680
we're here we're not going anywhere and

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,239
as the technology continues to evolve so

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,760
will we

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
i've broken this talk into three parts

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,159
yesterday today and tomorrow

93
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,519
i'm not going to spend a lot of time on

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,680
the history of who we were just enough

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,879
to show that the biohacker transhuman is

96
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,640
just the point where science technology

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,879
and humanity meet the idea behind

98
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,640
implanting technology inside the human

99
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,519
body has been around since the 1950s

100
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,040
the patent for the first cardiac

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,280
pacemaker was submitted in 1952 and was

102
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
the size of a table radio

103
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
this was not a fully implantable

104
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,319
solution and required leads to be

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,720
connected to an external power source

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
with the advent of the transistor in the

107
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,400
mid-1950s

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
the ability to construct a fully

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
implantable device was achieved in may

110
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,560
of 1958 the first implantable technology

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
was actually placed inside of a test

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
animal

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
the first human to receive an electrical

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
device implanted in the body was in

115
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,280
buffalo new york in 1960.

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,959
the tech up to this point was very

117
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,478
static and didn't allow for much in the

118
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,000
way of conditional executions or

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,358
modifications from the original

120
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,560
programming 1964 gave host to the first

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
implantable technology that can take

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,720
data from the body itself throughout the

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
70s and 80s there were advancements but

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
nothing that was really going to set

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
you know the implant community on its

126
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,479
ear

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,080
1990

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,320
is when things really started to pick up

129
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
for the implant community from the

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,720
creation of smart devices all the way

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
through to today where discussions of

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
artificial intelligence are commonplace

133
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,680
for biohackers our history was forged by

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
the medical profession to address

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
deficiencies of the human body from a

136
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
reactive perspective

137
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
by that i mean that the issues were

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,919
already there

139
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,600
additionally there were no options for

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,680
an individual to enhance themselves

141
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
through any type of technological way

142
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
so who are we today

143
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
people like myself are referred to by

144
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,039
many names

145
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,880
biohacker grinder transhuman

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
regardless of what name you want to put

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,520
on us

148
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
we all share the concept of moving

149
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,080
beyond the human form we were born into

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,240
the term transhuman was actually first

151
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,479
coined by julian huxley

152
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,800
in 1957

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
the movement he created was fueled by

154
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,479
multiple people looking to extend the

155
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
capabilities of the human being itself

156
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,800
so let's take a minute to talk about

157
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,320
some of these implants and what their

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
actual intended purposes are

159
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,160
these devices were designed to make

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
people's lives easier

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
we have the ability to start our

162
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
vehicles with implants imagine never

163
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,039
losing your keys again

164
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,520
or how many people have fobs to access a

165
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,560
gym

166
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,479
or a shared garage

167
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,120
or a storage unit all these could be

168
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,039
stored on an implant what about being

169
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
able to pay for goods and services with

170
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,039
the same methods as apple pay or android

171
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,720
wallet but you never have to worry about

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
forgetting your phone every one of these

173
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,199
activities constitute a legitimate use

174
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,639
case for

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
a microchip implant

176
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,960
unfortunately

177
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,520
not all of us are friendly

178
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,199
as security professionals we need to

179
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,560
start looking beyond what we're

180
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
comfortable with beyond the normal

181
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,479
attacks that we've heard of and dealt

182
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,759
with for years

183
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,759
the attacks and the end game may not

184
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
have changed but the delivery method has

185
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
come right off the movie screen and into

186
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,120
our company's infrastructures and data

187
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,319
centers

188
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,400
security admins know the normal attack

189
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,160
vectors usb drives phishing cbes you

190
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
know the list goes on and on

191
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,360
but how do you address the fact that any

192
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,039
one of your employees could potentially

193
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,039
have a full linux system

194
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
to rfid or nfc chips beneath their skin

195
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,280
what if someone implanted an hid or a

196
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,680
proximity access chip there would be no

197
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,520
evidence of any type of compromise to

198
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
the naked eye if someone was to be in a

199
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,840
restricted physical location chip

200
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
implants utilize the same technologies

201
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
that enterprises are using rfid door

202
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
badges nfc for iot

203
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
myfair

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
hid proximity cards and that's just a

205
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
few of them that i'm calling out right

206
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,560
off the top of my head

207
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,919
so

208
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,759
with the number of regulations and

209
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
audits that companies are required to do

210
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
for compliance how would you know if

211
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,440
someone has bypassed your security

212
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
policy and brought a rogue asset into

213
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,479
your environments

214
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,520
the simple answer is you wouldn't

215
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
i want to talk about a project called

216
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
the peg leg

217
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
the peg leg is a single board computer

218
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,400
that has been modified to a minimalistic

219
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
form factor with a wireless charging

220
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,720
receiver and then encased in biopolymer

221
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,199
and actually implanted within the body

222
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,199
this is on the outer edge of extreme

223
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,440
even for most biohackers

224
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,360
this is not a simple process and making

225
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
sure that the single board computer is

226
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
completely sealed has caused a number of

227
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,960
individuals that have attempted this

228
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
implant to require emergency removal

229
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
surgery

230
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,479
this still does not stop many more

231
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,720
including myself from trying to get one

232
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
of these things implanted

233
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,800
the possibilities for a concealed linux

234
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,960
system are only limited by one's

235
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
imagination

236
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,639
originally intended to act as a logless

237
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,879
file transfer drop the peg leg was

238
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
originally designed to leverage the

239
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,360
pirate box software however

240
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
as with anything in the technology space

241
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,919
people took that simple idea and have

242
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,399
branched out to more creative or devious

243
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,640
areas based on your perspective

244
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
full linux distributions have been

245
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,679
implanted these devices are headless

246
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,000
but have a wi-fi access point configured

247
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,040
to allow access to the implanted device

248
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,120
once connected the attacker has access

249
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,920
to a terminal for interactive processes

250
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,480
or could set to perform non-interactive

251
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
scans and sweeps for low energy

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
bluetooth that can be utilized for an

253
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,720
attack like blueborne or work in

254
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
conjunction with a usb share application

255
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
such as virtual here an attacker could

256
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
execute mouse jacking attacks and inject

257
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
automated payloads with tools like

258
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
jacket all while standing and having a

259
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
conversation with you or sitting next to

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
you at your desk

261
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
these devices have wi-fi as well as

262
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
bluetooth capabilities and can be

263
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,480
accessed over ssh from a mobile device

264
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
this would allow a bad actor to have

265
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,839
access to binaries or even something as

266
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,160
widely known as responder

267
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
they can be made into rogue access

268
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,839
points as well as command and control

269
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,000
servers the total number of peg leg

270
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
implants is really not widely known as

271
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,399
this was a community-based project

272
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,320
however the fact that there is at least

273
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
one individual that has this ability

274
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
should be more than enough to cause

275
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,880
security admins to stop and take notice

276
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
let's take a moment to think about this

277
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,120
how as security professionals

278
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
can we regulate secure locations if

279
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
people have the ability to conceal full

280
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,040
computers within their body

281
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,800
this becomes an even greater challenge

282
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,720
for companies and governmental agencies

283
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
who may require elevated clearance to

284
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,279
access files or physical locations this

285
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,880
essentially removes the power and the

286
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
control from the security authority by

287
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,640
obfuscating systems that can be

288
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,360
leveraged for various purposes

289
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,800
let's continue with our next attack

290
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,160
vector

291
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,320
this one is around the issue of physical

292
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
access

293
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
any company will have restricted

294
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,120
locations on-prem whether that be

295
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,519
executive offices to supply rooms to

296
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,880
server rooms

297
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
the need to keep access restricted in

298
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,279
some locations is just part of doing

299
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,720
business

300
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,800
there additionally i would bet a large

301
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
number of people in this room that have

302
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
a some type of work id badge on a

303
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
lanyard or on possibly on a key chain

304
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,320
and i would additionally bet there's a

305
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
large number of people that feel that

306
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,160
this type of badge and reader system is

307
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,000
an acceptable risk from an audit

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
perspective and as such should appease

309
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
the c-level execs to the fact that our

310
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
locations are secure

311
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,839
this is 2021. i really hope nobody here

312
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,200
believes that

313
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,279
how many people have an access badge on

314
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
a like i said on a lanyard or a

315
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
retractable belt clip most of the time

316
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
how many of us are spatially aware to

317
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,040
the point where if we were talking to

318
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
someone say

319
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
like me

320
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
would you notice if i palmed the tool

321
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,240
like a proxmark chameleon mini and was

322
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,079
able to read your access badge while we

323
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,120
were talking i know i know there's no

324
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
way that someone would be able to do

325
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
that to me

326
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,399
well i hope you're right

327
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,160
i have countless case studies that

328
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,480
involve cloned access badges that i can

329
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
use as proof that this is a viable

330
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,320
attack vector

331
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
the act of cloning an access badge isn't

332
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,760
even new

333
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
the technology has literally been

334
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,519
commercially available for almost a

335
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,800
decade

336
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
what makes this attack vector different

337
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,040
is there's no evidence of the breach

338
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,560
unlike the old days where an attacker

339
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,399
would need to have a copy of the clone

340
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,639
key or battery pack for the prox mark in

341
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
order to replay that scraped data

342
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,560
now attackers can write this information

343
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,959
with a sub thermal implant and proceed

344
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,040
with no way for security professionals

345
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,639
to know how their systems have been

346
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,920
compromised

347
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,360
so let's talk about the first attack

348
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
demonstration this one's called

349
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,639
handshake

350
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,360
handshake is a clone or replay attack

351
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,920
that utilizes the tool like i stated

352
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,959
proxmark any other card reader to read

353
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,839
the data contained on cards or access

354
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,480
fobs and then store or rewrite that tag

355
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,959
or information to another tag

356
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,880
in this case the other tag is just going

357
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,079
to be the implant in my left hand

358
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,519
so let's go ahead and i'll walk you

359
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,519
through this attack

360
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,399
nfc or near field communication is an

361
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,160
amazing technology that many of us have

362
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,240
in our pockets right now

363
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,720
every android device has full access to

364
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,760
transmit or receive nfc data

365
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,600
apple is a bit more complicated to

366
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,519
explain functionality

367
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,200
with ios 11 iphone 7 and 8 and x can be

368
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,519
used to read nfc tags

369
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,040
iphone 6 and 6s can be used to make nfc

370
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,120
payments with apple pay but has no

371
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,240
ability to read standalone nfc tags

372
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,040
apple at this time only allows nfc tags

373
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,839
to be read via apps there is no native

374
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
support for native reads

375
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,839
i can almost hear all of the iphone

376
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,760
people out there cheering you get a pass

377
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,040
on this one for now i have not heard of

378
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,600
any road map for iphones but as the

379
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,519
functionality continues to be adopted

380
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
for industries involving iot

381
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,519
i have to believe that apple is weighing

382
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,320
the security concerns very carefully

383
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,639
so like i just stated

384
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,040
standard nfc utilization can be almost

385
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,959
anything from beaming a file to a

386
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,320
co-worker or a friend or using a key fob

387
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
or app to transmit a signal to a

388
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,399
receiver to allow some action to take

389
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,279
place

390
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,440
here's where it gets interesting

391
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,240
nfc gets its power from the receiver

392
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,199
there's no internal power required

393
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,519
to be able to keep a loaded tag in a

394
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,360
waiting state

395
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,959
the implant that i will be using for

396
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,760
this next attack will be the flex next

397
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,320
and we're going to talk about leprosy

398
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
so the first attack as i said is leprosy

399
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
this attack may not always work as there

400
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,000
are a few conditions that need to be met

401
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
in order to execute properly those

402
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,360
conditions being nfc must be enabled and

403
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,279
allow apps from unknown source must be

404
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,199
enabled under the developers tools on

405
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,839
the android device that i'm attacking

406
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,360
at this point it's a matter of social

407
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,519
engineering a situation where i can get

408
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
my hands physically on your device

409
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,800
again i hear it all the time i never let

410
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,959
my phone out of my sight well that's

411
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,040
fine i don't need it out of your sight

412
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,360
this attack as well as flash hook are

413
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,680
designed to be performed and executed in

414
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,360
plain sight

415
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
and actually standing either right next

416
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
to you or sitting right next to you but

417
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
in close proximity

418
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,720
i don't think it would be a large

419
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,639
stretch of the imagine to assume that if

420
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,360
we work together and we maybe even if we

421
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
didn't if i was to make some scene about

422
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
an issue with my wife or maybe my

423
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,839
daughter or my granddaughter and i was

424
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,440
pleading for someone to help me make a

425
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,279
call i know the good samaritan out there

426
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,199
and someone would be there to be my

427
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,720
victim

428
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,040
we all have a built-in control to try

429
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,800
and avoid conflict as well as not

430
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,639
wanting to be viewed by our peers as

431
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,440
uncaring as an attacker i know this and

432
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,279
i will do everything in my power to take

433
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,680
advantage of it once the phone or tablet

434
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,079
is in my hands the receiver in the

435
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,600
device will pick up the tag i have

436
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,440
programmed in my hand that is pointing

437
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
to a web location containing an infected

438
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,399
apk that i've actually created through

439
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,120
the use of the msf venom tool from for

440
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
metasploit

441
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
so anyone not familiar with msf venom

442
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,079
it's part of the metasploit framework

443
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,079
and is used to create connections back

444
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,240
to the command control server

445
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,639
so i've gotten the device in my hands

446
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,720
the chip is prompted to either install

447
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,639
or save the file i go through the

448
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,240
motions of what appears to be making a

449
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
phone call what i'm actually doing is

450
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,720
loading the apk and then quickly

451
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
returning the device back to you the

452
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,440
owner

453
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
this attack will provide persistence as

454
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
well as a hidden icon so that the owner

455
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
would not be able to see anything out of

456
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,360
the ordinary as well as not finding

457
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,839
anything in the applications list to

458
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,480
show that i've done anything wrong

459
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,399
what if that was a work phone

460
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,839
what if that was the device you do your

461
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,199
banking with

462
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,040
in this scenario i'm already in your

463
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,480
phone before i eat i even leave the room

464
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,160
from the metasploit server i can gain

465
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,480
access to contacts emails photos

466
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
downloads essentially anything that is

467
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,199
on the device

468
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,240
all right

469
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,120
so

470
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,079
in this next use case i programmed the

471
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,000
chip in my hand to point to a very

472
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,399
specific website that's been compromised

473
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,639
with the beef sweet

474
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,600
beef is the browser exploit extension

475
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,720
framework

476
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
this infects or hooks the browsers of

477
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,120
any device that connects to it and

478
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,279
allows remote code execution as well as

479
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,519
potential persistence

480
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,440
through the beef suite the attacker can

481
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,519
enumerate the local land the device is

482
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,160
connected to as well as execute advanced

483
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,880
phishing attacks executed on the device

484
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,319
itself

485
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,480
again this requires a bit of social

486
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
engineering but as we just talked about

487
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
that's really not a problem

488
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,000
what makes this attack even more

489
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,240
dangerous than leprosy is that there's

490
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,959
no need to install anything

491
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,559
along with the fact that most mobile

492
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,559
devices have some type of web browser

493
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,919
pre-installed

494
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
nfc and a browser are the only

495
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,080
requirements for this attack

496
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,679
let's see how this attack looks in real

497
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
life

498
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,200
so

499
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,520
this brings us to the future

500
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,760
who will we become as technology

501
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,559
continues to evolve

502
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,559
we talk about the future of implants

503
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,240
it's as if we're trying to write a new

504
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,000
science fiction movie

505
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
companies like tesla are working on

506
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,080
technology like the neural link

507
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,520
a brain implant that will allow

508
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
interfacing between the brain directly

509
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,600
to a computer system this sounds like a

510
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
man-in-the-middle scenario just waiting

511
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,039
to happen to me

512
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,880
products like the will it

513
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,960
a bluetooth receiver that requires no

514
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,720
batteries and gets its power from the

515
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,200
air and we all know that bluetooth is

516
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
not vulnerable right

517
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
never heard of blueborne imagine if that

518
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,880
attack could jump from person to person

519
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,720
or what about implantable wi-fi

520
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,640
transmitters and receivers

521
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
there's a product in development right

522
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,120
now called a neurogram

523
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
this is essentially turning the human

524
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,000
being into a wi-fi access point nobody's

525
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
ever been able to compromise wi-fi

526
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,360
before right

527
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,799
and these are just a few that we know

528
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,000
about

529
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,679
currently the biggest restriction to

530
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,760
advanced technology implants is still

531
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,240
the power source

532
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
there's not currently an effective way

533
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,880
to provide clean power to any devices on

534
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,799
a commercial implant

535
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,640
this is the same issue with the peg leg

536
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,320
and the need for the indirect fast

537
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,200
charge

538
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,440
it's not always the computer technology

539
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
that needs to catch up

540
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,039
in this case the only thing holding back

541
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,280
progress is power

542
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,559
once that's been addressed the

543
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,960
possibility of 24x7 access to an

544
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,440
embedded system in the body is not that

545
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
far out of reality

546
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,240
i want to take a moment to talk about

547
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
the legality

548
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,480
morality and ethical issues around

549
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,960
implanted technologies

550
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,880
from a legal perspective there is no

551
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
federal laws regulating microchip

552
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,120
implants at the state level as you can

553
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,760
see from the graphic on your screen

554
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,200
there are multiple states that have

555
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,919
adopted different types of legislation

556
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,080
there are essentially two real types of

557
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
laws that have been passed around

558
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
microchip land plants within the united

559
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,559
states

560
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,720
one mainly focuses around employers and

561
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,159
one that is pretty much just general

562
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,960
first one is banning employers mandating

563
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
employees microchips themselves with

564
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
implants and number two is just a

565
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
straight out general ban on all

566
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,039
microchip implants

567
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,799
so let's talk about liability from an

568
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,039
employer's perspective

569
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,000
if an employee gets chipped does that in

570
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
and of itself make that employee a

571
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,720
security risk what if they're just using

572
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,200
the chip to access a gym or a garage

573
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,799
that has nothing to do with the company

574
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,640
but the chip could be used in a

575
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,080
defensive manner

576
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,679
would that be something that a ciso

577
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,600
would want to know

578
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,280
we allow employees to bring personal

579
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
phones to work excluding restricted

580
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,400
areas

581
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,320
but detection is a hell of a lot more

582
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,440
obvious

583
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
much of the current legislation stems

584
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
from a push to replace access badges

585
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,400
with implants for physical security

586
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
but as this may help from a you know the

587
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,520
i lost my badge perspective

588
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
it doesn't enhance the security posture

589
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,799
for a company

590
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,200
remember implant chips at this point are

591
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
static

592
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,480
they require a reader or power source to

593
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,880
be able to function now just like with

594
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,360
the handshake attack bad actors could

595
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,960
use the singing tools and scrape the

596
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,039
target's implant information the same as

597
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,679
if it was on a physical key card

598
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,360
the main difference being that you can

599
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,600
take your key card and lock it at home

600
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,960
when you go out

601
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,840
implants are on all the time

602
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,760
there's a receiver within range they

603
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
will read the chip

604
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,320
there is currently no off switch and as

605
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,880
such attackers now have 24 7 access to

606
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,840
physical access data

607
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
when we talk about the concepts of

608
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
morality and ethics unfortunately the

609
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,840
topic of faith typically comes into play

610
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,919
in these discussions i want to take a

611
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,679
moment and say that i am in no way

612
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,200
trying to be disrespectful to any

613
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
religion faith i'm speaking just to the

614
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,240
questions that i have personally heard

615
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
as an international speaker i've had

616
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,679
discussions with people all over the

617
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,360
world about my implants

618
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,440
discussions typically go in basically

619
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,200
one of two different directions

620
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,039
mostly it starts with fear from whoever

621
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,880
i'm talking to me you know i've been

622
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,320
told that i have the mark of the beast

623
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,760
i've been told that i am being tracked

624
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,000
by the man i've been asked if it's the

625
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,760
same chip that people have in their dogs

626
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,960
or cats

627
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
all of these conversations are driven by

628
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
the fear of the unknown or the different

629
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
i've had acquaintances tell me that

630
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,760
they're physically afraid of me due to

631
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,919
my implants i don't really understand

632
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,440
what they're afraid of

633
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,480
you know it's almost as though they

634
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,600
think i'm going to turn into a

635
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,480
terminator and go on a rampage the truth

636
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,640
is that there are more people like me

637
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,000
out there than you

638
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,840
probably could imagine

639
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,039
the difference is that i don't have a

640
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,039
problem with people knowing who and what

641
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,320
i am

642
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,559
many others like me keep their implants

643
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,520
secret

644
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,440
over the concern of the social stigma

645
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,600
associated with microchipping

646
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,080
the decision to augment ourselves should

647
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
hold no weight in regards to the issues

648
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
of faith or morality provided that that

649
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
decision is still left with the

650
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
individual and not a mandate from any

651
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
type of authority

652
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,480
like i said earlier not all of us are

653
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,280
friendly but most of us are

654
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,240
so

655
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,720
how far is too far

656
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
you know we briefly touched on the tesla

657
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,200
neural link and the peg leg two very

658
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,039
different products with broad sweeping

659
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,760
ramifications to the individual as well

660
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,240
as employers and law enforcement

661
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,559
i remember a movie from 1995 called

662
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,960
johnny mnemonic where the lead actor has

663
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
a hard drive in his brain and is using

664
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,279
it for store as a storage device and is

665
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,080
a courier for stolen data

666
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,679
or the matrix

667
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,440
where to learn a new skill we just load

668
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,039
the instruction set and we have that

669
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,720
knowledge within our minds

670
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,159
the genie is out of the bottle at this

671
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,679
point and there is no way it's going

672
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,120
back in

673
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,039
as technology continues to advance and

674
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,120
improve the quality of life

675
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,960
we need to remember that any tool

676
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,120
regardless of what its original intent

677
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,279
was can be misused

678
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,880
as security professionals we need to be

679
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
aware of this and adapt our counter

680
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,559
measures to include this new attack

681
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,679
vector

682
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,720
the fact that there is nothing

683
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,640
unilateral across the board it will in

684
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,799
most locations become a corporate

685
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,559
decision on how to address shipped

686
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,919
employees

687
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,000
without a better understanding of the

688
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,080
technologies being discussed these

689
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,600
choices may be made for the wrong

690
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,240
reasons to say anyone with an implanted

691
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,559
technology is an automatic threat would

692
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,039
be that saying any car owner could be a

693
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,320
vehicular homicide suspect

694
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,760
so

695
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,200
takeaways

696
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,120
in the next couple of weeks what should

697
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,320
you do

698
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,799
if you are dealing with contactless

699
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,880
technology audit that com those

700
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,720
contactless protocols for vulnerable

701
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
technologies

702
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,919
within the next three months following

703
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,360
this presentation

704
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,279
understand the scope of your contactless

705
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,679
systems as well as defining appropriate

706
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,919
controls

707
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,320
within six months implement technologies

708
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
which allow for an additional security

709
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,600
for contactless technologies like the

710
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,799
addition of switches lock passwords

711
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,039
bac or mutual authentication

712
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,000
