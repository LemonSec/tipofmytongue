1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,240
hi everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,360
mobile security in a remote world

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,920
my name is allie mellon i'm a security

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,639
strategist

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,000
in the office of the cso at cyber reason

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,760
i've been in tech for

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,920
a decade now i'm working on

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
various engineering projects i'm a

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,320
computer engineer by training

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,960
and i spent five of those years running

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,439
my own

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,440
mobile app development and engineering

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,960
company

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
in that time i learned a lot about

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
mobile app development and really gained

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,520
an appreciation for mobile devices

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,960
i was definitely driven towards

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,680
security through some iot research that

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,239
i did

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,800
and um so i've been in security for the

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,360
past

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,079
several years looking at it more as an

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,879
enterprise

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,440
problem as opposed to solely mobile but

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,000
of course

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,840
i think mobile is a very important part

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
of that and that's part of

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,319
why i'm giving this talk today so let's

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,720
dive in

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,720
for the agenda we're going to start by

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,960
talking about security today

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,400
before really diving into what mobile is

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
and what enterprise protection for

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,920
mobile

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,720
looks like after that we're going to

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,119
give

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,920
a really cool example of mobile malware

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,640
research

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,080
that our threat research team did

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,680
and then i'm going to talk about the

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,240
importance of a unified approach

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
to enterprise mobile security and mobile

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,840
protection

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
so before i can talk about

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,439
security today i really need to start by

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,600
talking about security yesterday

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,079
things have changed so much in the past

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,880
year

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
and really accelerated us through a

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,960
digital transformation

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,360
but what's really important to note is

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
we were on this path before

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
it was just perhaps a little bit slower

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,119
than what we've been through the last

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,360
year

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,720
so i want to talk about the enterprise

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,440
device

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,480
makeup before 2020.

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,920
we saw a big mix of bring your own

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,959
company-owned and custom devices and

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,800
custom devices would be anything like

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
point-of-sale devices

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
what's fascinating about this is that

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
only 26 of companies actually offer work

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,080
smartphones for their employees

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,120
so you're facing a problem

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,239
where very few companies are actually

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
giving access to these devices which

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,519
means

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,760
they can't protect what they don't

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,360
distribute

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
but further what further complicates

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:48,800
this

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,760
is 87 percent of organizations actually

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,280
expect their employees

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,440
to use their personal phones for work

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
it's very pervasive

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,080
so you're expecting people to use a

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,360
personal device

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
to access corporate data to communicate

81
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
about corporate issues

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,959
but most likely the organization

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,280
has not actually distributed that device

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,040
and doesn't really have any claims to

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,319
protecting that device

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,920
so i want to ask the audience do you use

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,840
your personal smartphone for work

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,879
i personally do um before everything

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
happened with lockdown and the pandemic

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,799
i would use it quite frequently whether

91
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,840
i was taking an

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,879
uber into work checking emails or

93
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,680
accessing google drive so that i could

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,400
write up a document

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,480
and this is an important question to

96
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,519
think about

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,799
as we consider whether or not mobile

98
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,000
devices are something

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,799
that are worth protecting as an

100
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,360
enterprise

101
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,760
and the numbers back this up 60 of

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,480
devices

103
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,640
containing or accessing enterprise data

104
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,840
are mobile and this was before 2020.

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,120
that's massive that's a massive number

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
of devices especially when you consider

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,519
that

108
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,599
for example right now i'm using my

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,799
laptop

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,840
to communicate with you not my mobile

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
device

112
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,279
and what compounds on top of that

113
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,839
is that enterprise users are three times

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,639
more likely

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,960
to fall for a phishing link on a small

116
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,880
screen than a desktop

117
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
so the main place that individuals

118
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,400
are accessing corporate data is actually

119
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,479
a place that's much easier to fall for a

120
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,199
phishing attack

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
now i want to talk about security today

122
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,479
with that basis

123
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,199
of security yesterday most of us are

124
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,240
stuck at home

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,840
i know um from my aunt who is in italy

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,919
she's telling me that uh lockdown

127
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
restrictions for italy have gotten much

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,919
more severe depending on your location

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,479
modena for example is categorized in a

130
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,840
red zone

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,240
and we have to integrate work

132
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,280
into our existing lifestyle as we work

133
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,759
from home

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,320
in fact 74 percent of companies plan to

135
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
shift permanently to remote work

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,120
postcovid

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
so it's really important to kind of

138
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,199
embed

139
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,600
uh working from home into your lifestyle

140
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
and a lot of people do that by using

141
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,759
their mobile devices more

142
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,880
this shift to 100

143
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,840
remote work has really exponentially

144
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,479
increased our digital transformation

145
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,160
take an example of how messy

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,639
our work lives and our personal lives

147
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,440
have become

148
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,600
say you are someone who has to work from

149
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,639
home right now

150
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,440
your kids are not in school they are at

151
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,639
home with you

152
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,120
you have to take them outside go to the

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
playground

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,720
make sure that they have time to be kids

155
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,560
which can be really challenging in this

156
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
environment

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
and most likely you're going to have to

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,000
do that during a work day

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,400
because that's when you know kids want

160
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,840
to play

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
so what you have to consider is that in

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
that situation you're most likely going

163
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
to bring your mobile device with you

164
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,280
because you want to make sure that you

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,360
can read any slack messages

166
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,440
or if you get an important email you

167
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,120
have access to it so you know what's

168
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,199
going on at work

169
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,639
so automatically we have this tendency

170
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,720
to really start using our mobile devices

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
more and more and you could say the same

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,280
thing for

173
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
if you have a dog that you have to take

174
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
outside for walks during the day

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,759
you're gonna want to have your mobile

176
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,880
phone on you

177
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,520
to make calls and to answer emails and

178
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
to make sure that you're up to date on

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
things even though you're not

180
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,599
at home yet sitting at your computer

181
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,280
so i want to start by really thinking

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,319
about what mobile

183
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,520
is like here's a question for you is

184
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
a laptop mobile because you can move

185
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
around with it

186
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,319
and so i want to level set on

187
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,319
what i'm talking about as a mobile

188
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,720
device so that we can really understand

189
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,400
what's important with this approach i

190
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,960
for the context of this conversation i'm

191
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,319
really going to talk about

192
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,880
mobile devices as that smartphone

193
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,919
component that

194
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,440
a lot of us have but what i really want

195
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,280
you to be thinking as we go throughout

196
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,319
this talk

197
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,800
is that it really shouldn't matter when

198
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,080
you're thinking about enterprise

199
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,800
security and we need to push towards

200
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,560
a world where it is just another device

201
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,960
that has to be integrated into a strong

202
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,319
security strategy

203
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,479
because we can't continue to have point

204
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,080
solutions for all these various

205
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,960
different types

206
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,400
of devices it's unsustainable

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,919
especially as we approach areas where

208
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,520
we're going to have a lot more iot

209
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,800
devices

210
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
and things like drones and more laptops

211
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,879
ipads

212
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
there's just too much and we need to be

213
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
able to have a unified solution

214
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,360
to bring that all together instead of

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,639
keeping them as

216
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
separate elements

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,520
so let's talk about the risk when it

218
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,759
comes to mobile devices specifically

219
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,039
smartphones

220
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,960
i really think about this in two

221
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,160
different ways first

222
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
there's the on device risks of course

223
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,919
this is the one that most people think

224
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,400
about

225
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,120
things like what corporate data you

226
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,360
might have stored locally on your device

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,640
um what financial applications

228
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
you might have access to on that device

229
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,159
etc

230
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,240
the other side of the coin that i find

231
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
really fascinating and i think is

232
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,159
particularly important now

233
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,120
is mobile devices being used as an entry

234
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
point into the enterprise

235
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,800
and i want to dig down into these a

236
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,279
little bit more

237
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,240
starting with data that's found on the

238
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
device

239
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,880
so on a device like a smartphone there's

240
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,720
a lot of risks

241
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,279
whether it's device storage the actual

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,120
data that's stored on the device

243
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
whether it's things like authentication

244
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
factors and being able to actually

245
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,200
bypass two-factor authentication which

246
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,959
we're going to see later

247
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
in the mobile malware research example

248
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
that i'm going to walk through with you

249
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,240
guys

250
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
also things like surveillance are really

251
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,680
important to consider

252
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,920
we saw this last year with operation

253
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,720
soft cell

254
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,760
albeit from a really different angle in

255
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,080
that attack attackers use call detail

256
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
records to track high value targets

257
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,640
but what's interesting about that is

258
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
it's still about

259
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
what data was on the phone and was then

260
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
sent to the telecommunications provider

261
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
and so if you could access that more

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,640
directly by just accessing the phone

263
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,959
you'd have an even more potent attack so

264
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,720
mobile presents a really unique way

265
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,480
to not only access stuff that's on the

266
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
device but also to

267
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,440
track people and to um

268
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,480
spy on them in an inconspicuous way

269
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
you basically have this little device

270
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
that has a microphone

271
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,120
a camera an accelerometer a gps you have

272
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,160
it attached to your hip

273
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,399
all the time that's basically a spy's

274
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,720
dream

275
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
so now i want to ask with regards to

276
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,200
data on the device and business

277
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
applications on the device

278
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,959
do you have any of these on your phone

279
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,880
do you use things like salesforce on

280
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
your phone or your ipad

281
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,839
do you use docusign this is a

282
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,800
particularly dangerous one

283
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
if you are for example working for a

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,120
um working for or if you are

285
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
a member of the legal team at your

286
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,560
organization

287
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,079
a lot of legal teams are going to have

288
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,160
docusign on their devices because they

289
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,360
need to sign

290
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,519
documents quite frequently and they tend

291
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,720
to be very sensitive documents

292
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,760
do you use something like asana which as

293
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,519
a project management tool

294
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,800
may seem less scary than the other

295
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
examples however that can store a lot of

296
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,399
information about

297
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,360
your approach to market or what your

298
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,200
engineering teams are working on

299
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,920
and can actually contain some valuable

300
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,560
information for an attacker

301
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,079
and of course applications like zoom

302
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,399
which immediately give you access to

303
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,480
other individuals in the organization

304
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
and you could ultimately use to record

305
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
conversations

306
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,959
make sure you know who's meeting with

307
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,279
whom really have a direct access point

308
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,079
to someone else in the organization

309
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,880
and then of course google drive where a

310
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,600
lot of us

311
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,000
store a lot of really important data the

312
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,839
same thing could be said for microsoft

313
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,000
teams

314
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,079
there's a lot of information stored in

315
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
google drive and on microsoft teams that

316
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
you wouldn't necessarily want an

317
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,200
attacker to gain access to

318
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480
and i also want to talk about the um

319
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
enterprise entry point this is

320
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,519
something that i find to be a really

321
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,079
fascinating avenue of attack

322
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
say that you are on a mobile device and

323
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,160
your device has been infected by malware

324
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,519
you decided to go to

325
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920
the local starbucks joined the wi-fi

326
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
there but it turns out

327
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,639
that you didn't actually join the

328
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,279
legitimate wi-fi it was starbucks

329
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,959
we fee instead of starbucks wi-fi and

330
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,600
you so you connect to that wi-fi an

331
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,160
attacker

332
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,959
immediately um gets access to your

333
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,079
device

334
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,160
you get infected with malware and then

335
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
you go to work this is a day

336
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,920
where we're not in a pandemic and you're

337
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,079
actually able to go into the office

338
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,760
you connect to the enterprise network

339
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
once you get in and you're now connected

340
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,839
to all of these other devices

341
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,079
like laptops like other mobile devices

342
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,360
potentially iot devices to

343
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,880
other people's workstations and

344
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,000
this allows an attacker to use

345
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
what seems like a very inconspicuous

346
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
target

347
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,600
and actually get onto some more valuable

348
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
what they consider more valuable assets

349
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,959
and to spread

350
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,000
quickly what's really important about

351
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,560
this

352
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
is that 80 percent of malicious apps

353
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
have access to internal networks

354
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,839
and are scanning nearby ports so this is

355
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,560
something that

356
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,360
the majority of mobile malware is

357
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,800
actively trying to do

358
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,360
they want to get to that next entry

359
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,880
point they want to try and

360
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,440
get as far as they possibly can within

361
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,519
an enterprise and really spread as much

362
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,800
as possible

363
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,440
and so while it may seem like oh my

364
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,760
mobile device i just text my friends

365
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,199
it's not a big deal

366
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,079
it can be the thing it can be that

367
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,160
server in the middle of nowhere that no

368
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,519
one knows about

369
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,240
that gets infiltrated except every

370
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
single employee in the company has one

371
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,480
on them

372
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,120
and when we're thinking about mobile

373
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,279
security solutions

374
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,880
what it automatically brings up is

375
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,120
things like mobile threat detection

376
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,440
and mobile threat detection is about

377
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,519
collecting the data on the device

378
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,240
actually analyzing it and then using

379
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,199
that information

380
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,399
to do prevention through mobile av

381
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,320
or actually do detection and response

382
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
effectively

383
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
and the goal is to do that in real time

384
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,959
across mobile devices

385
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,760
what's interesting about this is that

386
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,920
it's really complementary to things like

387
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,959
mobile device

388
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,480
management mint or emm it's not meant to

389
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,800
be

390
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,839
this conflicting element but really it's

391
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,079
about making a more cohesive security

392
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,880
strategy

393
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,839
for an organization so mobile device

394
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,639
management

395
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,279
emm that is really on the it side of the

396
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:49,839
house

397
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,800
it's critical to have it's all about

398
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
addressing those policy questions

399
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,880
making sure that the device is um

400
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,440
really up to date and doesn't have any

401
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
applications installed that you wouldn't

402
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,560
want it to have

403
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,600
but you still need just like with

404
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,040
laptops

405
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,600
an approach that is able to block

406
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,279
incoming malware is able to

407
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,560
identify and prevent or detect

408
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,120
and allow analysts to remediate incoming

409
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,240
malware

410
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,600
so that mix is really where you see a

411
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,399
the best solution that for the most part

412
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,480
we have today to these mobile security

413
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,880
threats

414
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,079
let's dive into an example

415
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,680
to make this a little bit less

416
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,639
theoretical that i think is very cool

417
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,560
and very important to understand because

418
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
it just really

419
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,199
exemplifies the importance of defending

420
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,199
mobile devices

421
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,480
so um

422
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,360
this piece of malware is called eventbot

423
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,279
it is a mobile banking trojan

424
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,519
that our team found targeting the

425
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,040
financial services

426
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,440
space and it's really looking to gather

427
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,399
user data

428
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,199
it specifically was targeting the us and

429
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,800
europe

430
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,480
and what's really cool about this

431
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,079
is these are the applications that it

432
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,519
targeted over

433
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,399
200 different financial applications

434
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:18,880
which is

435
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,160
a massive number

436
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,320
and i want to call out some really high

437
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,279
profile ones like capital one uk

438
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,199
paypal business revolut

439
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,279
santander uk transferwise

440
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,480
coinbase ing direct

441
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
and unicredit i for example

442
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
have transferwise on my phone today i

443
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,399
use it quite often whenever i'm doing

444
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:46,800
any

445
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,360
consulting work with people in europe or

446
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,560
other countries

447
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
and a lot of people have these

448
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,880
applications on their personal

449
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
devices and what i think is really

450
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
important to highlight here

451
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,639
is that this is not just about

452
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,920
applications

453
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,039
that consumers use though we did see

454
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,119
some examples of ones that mainly

455
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,400
consumers use

456
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,000
in this list however there are also

457
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,959
applications

458
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
like paypal business these financial

459
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,880
services applications

460
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,959
that are for enterprises that are

461
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,760
specifically built for enterprises

462
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,679
so they're not just targeting the

463
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,839
consumers on the mobile device they're

464
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,000
targeting the enterprises that they work

465
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,319
for

466
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,360
or work with and that's really important

467
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,240
because

468
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,200
a lot of times the mobile threat gets

469
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,760
lost

470
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,919
in well that's a consumer device not an

471
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,039
enterprise device

472
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,039
but what we're seeing is through the

473
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,520
ease of use of mobile applications

474
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,840
it is becoming a business device

475
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,559
and sorry you really already become it

476
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,039
so

477
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,720
what does this attack actually look like

478
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,160
how do they actually gain access to

479
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,440
these applications

480
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,559
they start by actually um tricking an

481
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,480
unsuspecting user to download the

482
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
application it's masquerading as a

483
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,799
legitimate application

484
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,480
and that's how they gain initial access

485
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,360
and we actually saw this attack

486
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,400
so early on that we were able to see

487
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,080
it iteratively improving its style

488
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,440
and its um visual so that

489
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,360
the attacker could ultimately get it on

490
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
the google play store

491
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,640
and though we didn't see it on the

492
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
google play store because it was so

493
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
early in the development cycles

494
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,160
that's where this was headed and that's

495
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,080
the goal of this application is to get

496
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,600
on the app store to become more trusted

497
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,840
after initial access we see the

498
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
application get control of

499
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,600
accessibility features and it starts to

500
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,960
run in the background

501
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,120
and it just asks for accessibility

502
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
features it's already tricked the user

503
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,280
into thinking the application is

504
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,039
legitimate and downloading it to their

505
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:53,919
device

506
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,760
so getting control of the accessibility

507
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
features just seems like a natural next

508
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
step for the user

509
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,320
after that it starts to collect

510
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,760
reconnaissance information

511
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,000
like the device info and the names of

512
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,919
various android packages

513
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,600
that's how we know exactly which

514
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
applications it's targeting

515
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,840
and that's how it identifies if any of

516
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
the applications it's targeting are

517
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,679
located on the device

518
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,400
from there it collects information it's

519
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,080
tracking the device pin

520
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,120
it's collecting personal data

521
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,320
keystrokes passwords for anyone

522
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,080
who's on this call i'm sure none of you

523
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,880
have done it because you're good

524
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,320
security professionals

525
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,760
but there are a lot of people out there

526
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
who copy paste passwords

527
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,559
from the notes app into their

528
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,320
applications perhaps even their

529
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,400
financial applications

530
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,520
this malware has that password now in

531
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,760
that username

532
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,840
from there it exfiltrates all that

533
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,039
information to

534
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,760
its c2 server and now you might be

535
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,640
thinking

536
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,679
okay this is fine i still have

537
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,760
two-factor authentication enabled on

538
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,559
these

539
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,559
accounts so even if the attacker tries

540
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,600
to log in

541
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,159
they can't take any money out because of

542
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,840
my two-factor authentication

543
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
but keep in mind that for most

544
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,880
individuals

545
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,679
two-factor authentication gets sent as a

546
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,960
text message

547
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,840
to your mobile device which the attacker

548
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
has control of

549
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,120
so when they go to log into these

550
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,640
accounts

551
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,240
they actually steal that sms message

552
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,880
coming into your mobile device they send

553
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,720
any relevant information back to the

554
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,760
attacker

555
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,000
and then they delete the message so you

556
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,039
never know

557
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,520
that two-factor authentication was being

558
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,400
used

559
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,640
and the attacker is able to actually get

560
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,679
into the account

561
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,880
and not appear to be someone else

562
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,520
or someone trying to attack the account

563
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
and then of course for all of these

564
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,760
attacks we actually map them to mitre

565
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,799
attack for mobile

566
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,080
if any of you don't know what miter

567
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
attack is it's a knowledge base of

568
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
adversary um tactics and techniques

569
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,280
they do this at the enterprise level and

570
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,039
separately for mobile

571
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,360
and um i think it's really cool it gives

572
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,120
you a nice view of what's going on in

573
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,760
the attack

574
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,240
and so i highly recommend everyone check

575
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,840
it out if you have the opportunity and

576
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,679
use it to

577
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,360
map your attacks we do it with every

578
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,039
piece of research and

579
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,120
it's really valuable because it lets us

580
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,280
see things as that timeline the attack

581
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,240
like with eventbot

582
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,960
and then we also have seen pandemic

583
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,480
related mobile malware

584
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,880
taking the form of things like fake

585
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
world health organization applications

586
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,360
this is really to play off of existing

587
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,600
fears and to get people to download

588
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,400
things that

589
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,440
again appear legitimate appear like

590
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,799
they're coming from the google play

591
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,520
store but really the user is downloading

592
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,039
a third-party application from a

593
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,480
third-party site

594
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,679
and that's one of the biggest things

595
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,039
that i can recommend to people who are

596
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,480
concerned about this

597
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,039
only download from from the actual

598
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,240
google play store

599
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,840
or the ios app store

600
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,440
now back to the enterprise

601
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
threat here and understanding the

602
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,600
enterprise threat a little more

603
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,640
from a security standpoint

604
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,520
i know that i personally do not want

605
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,880
another point solution

606
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
in my organization i am on the

607
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,039
infrastructure security and product

608
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,440
security team at cyber region

609
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
we know that the average security team

610
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,919
has over 25 different security tools

611
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,159
and i do not want to add one more onto

612
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,120
that list

613
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,080
i don't want another console to monitor

614
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,039
but

615
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,520
the question is if we don't do that how

616
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,440
do we approach the problem

617
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,000
and what i think is really important to

618
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,120
note here

619
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
is that attacks don't stop at their

620
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
first entry point and we saw this

621
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
when we think about mobile being used to

622
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,320
actually go from just the mobile device

623
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,559
to the rest of the enterprise network to

624
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,320
spread to different applications

625
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720
it's not just stopping in one place and

626
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,840
so even

627
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
in cases where we put a point solution

628
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,120
in place

629
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,679
the problem that we will run into is

630
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,200
that we won't be able to see the full

631
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,640
scope of the attack

632
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,559
we will have an analyst who is looking

633
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,240
at mobile devices we'll have an analyst

634
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,559
who's looking at traditional endpoints

635
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,080
and they'll manually have to make the

636
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
connection between these attacks

637
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,840
assuming that an organization actually

638
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,440
uses something like

639
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,679
mobile threat detection which most

640
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,320
organizations are not prepared for

641
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,880
so even in those instances we're putting

642
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,080
the analysts through

643
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
even more work than they had to do

644
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,679
before which is

645
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,400
not ideal and is not scalable either

646
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,080
so what i want to really

647
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,600
talk about here is the importance that

648
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,600
we need a unifier that isn't a human

649
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,559
and we need it because it needs to be

650
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,440
the blueprint

651
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,600
for the future and for how we approach

652
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,799
this problem in the future because

653
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,400
mobile is just one step in this

654
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,440
evolution

655
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,480
this is not the end point this is the

656
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
starting point for more types of devices

657
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,520
that we're going to see

658
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,799
accessing the enterprise network

659
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,200
and so what i really think is important

660
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,960
is that we talk about this problem

661
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,520
in the context of a more complete

662
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,159
solution

663
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,440
that is not just taking and addressing

664
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,080
attacks

665
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
that are happening on mobile devices

666
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,520
that is not just taking and addressing

667
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
attacks that are

668
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,000
on traditional endpoints we need

669
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,320
a more comprehensive solution that's

670
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,080
about taking in the data across

671
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,159
all of these and really a security

672
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,960
strategy that aligns to this as well

673
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
that takes in data from all of these

674
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,400
applications and is able

675
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,039
to actually understand the full scope of

676
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,320
an attack

677
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,880
and this is something that i think is

678
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,000
really important

679
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,240
as enterprises consider how they want to

680
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,960
approach their mobile security strategy

681
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
and how that incorporates into their

682
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,080
enterprise

683
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,919
strategy because the next phase in this

684
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,720
is things like iot devices and we need

685
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,240
to be thinking about that

686
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,880
as we move forward and thinking about

687
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
the fact that

688
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,840
if we take an approach that isn't

689
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
scalable we're going to run into

690
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
problems down the line

691
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,320
because we can't just continue to accept

692
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,480
all of these devices

693
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
in different ways and with different

694
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,480
point solutions so we really need a

695
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,279
unified

696
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,000
strategy and a unified approach i think

697
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,440
that when you're looking at

698
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,799
vendors that provide this type of

699
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,480
protection you need to look at ones that

700
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,320
really do integrate very closely

701
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,520
not just with emm or with mdm

702
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,799
but also with any type of protection

703
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,400
that you already have in place for your

704
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,600
traditional endpoints

705
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,000
and i want to thank you guys so much for

706
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
attending

707
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,520
um feel free to reach out to me with any

708
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,240
questions ally at cybereason.com you can

709
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
also find me on twitter

710
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,960
bella and i'm happy to talk more um i'm

711
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,919
also happy to take any questions

712
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,200
okay thank you ali as

713
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
we said before there is a bit of delay

714
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
between

715
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,679
the stream and and the live on youtube

716
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,279
so we have to wait some minutes

717
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,480
by the way we have already gabriele who

718
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,679
asks

719
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,799
do you know were you able to recognize

720
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,679
who's behind the event who developed

721
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,200
state funded

722
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,799
or criminal organizations great question

723
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,360
um we were not able to attribute this

724
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,679
threat to a particular threat actor

725
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,919
however it isn't i think it is important

726
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,039
to note that it

727
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,080
since it is so advanced it's i would

728
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
expect it's mostly

729
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
likely nation state-backed just because

730
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
it's much more advanced than you would

731
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,559
expect from

732
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:58,960
um from any criminal organization
