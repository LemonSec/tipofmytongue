00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,879
hi everyone welcome to my talk on

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,560
application testing methodology and

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,600
scope based record

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,440
my name is harsh bhutra and i will be

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,440
guiding you through my own application

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,719
testing methodology

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,559
and scope based recon approach which i

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,639
follow for my own pen testing and bug

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,679
boundary

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,840
it helped me a lot in the past to

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,000
quickly gain a pace into bug bounty

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
and get some good result out of it

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,680
before diving directly

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,680
into the topic i would first like to

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
thank omar graham conference and

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,080
red team village for inviting me to

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,279
present my views

18
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,079
to all of you a quick introduction about

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,800
me

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,559
i currently work as a cyber security

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,480
analyst at detox technologies

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
i am a cyanocrat teamer i am currently

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,520
into

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,840
top 115 buck crowd all-time leaderboard

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,680
mvp for q1 and q2

26
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,039
i have authored multiple books on

27
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,280
hacking recommended by aict and ni

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
tritty at chandigarh

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,039
i often blog about security findings

30
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,920
that i have

31
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,239
i speak at the conferences for various

32
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,719
topics like recon broken cryptography

33
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,359
and similar other topics sometimes i

34
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:01,840
write

35
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,760
poems and all and i am a lifelong

36
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,840
learner like you all are

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
the agender for today's talk would be to

38
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,439
talk about application testing

39
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,320
methodology

40
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,960
how i created my own methodology and how

41
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
i applied

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,479
further we will be looking at threat

43
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,960
mapping manual testing approach

44
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,520
recon 101 what is scope based recon

45
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,400
methodology

46
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,479
how you can utilize it what are the

47
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,520
various small medium and large copricon

48
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
at last some of the offensive recon

49
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,040
tactics that i use

50
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,640
and ultimately if you have any question

51
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
and answer you can bombard it

52
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
okay so first let's talk about

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,240
application testing methodology it is

54
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,159
really crucial to understand that

55
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
whenever you are performing a pen test

56
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
or doing bug boundaries

57
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,720
having an approach having a methodology

58
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,600
always

59
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
helps you out to stay ahead of your

60
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,680
target be organized

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,159
so these are few seven steps that i

62
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,880
usually

63
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
go about while doing any pen test or

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
participating into any background

65
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,399
program

66
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,079
the first thing is define the target

67
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,399
scope defining the target scope

68
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,639
always helps you to stay in a particular

69
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,679
scope and

70
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
reduces eliminates the chances of being

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
out of scope

72
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
and ultimately save you from unnecessary

73
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
hazards that you might do

74
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,520
secondly understand the applications

75
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
business logic this is the crucial step

76
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
a lot of people they directly jump

77
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
testing the application

78
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,879
now before performing an attack

79
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,640
always make sure that you know that your

80
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
weapon are

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
completely fine they are completely

82
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
ready you know your enemy well

83
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
so navigate an application like a normal

84
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,239
user understand the various workflows of

85
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,360
the application

86
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,760
if there is an uh e-commerce application

87
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
understand what all workflows it goes

88
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,400
through

89
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,560
from selecting a product to adding it to

90
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,480
the card from purchasing it to refunding

91
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
it or like that

92
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,080
try to create a threat map in the third

93
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
step based on the various

94
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
functionalities try to create a threat

95
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,000
map okay

96
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,640
there is a functionality of refund can i

97
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,280
abuse it

98
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
if yes then what are the possible

99
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
theoretical ways to abuse that

100
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,480
we will look at threat map in the next

101
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,080
section

102
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,400
further perform scope based recon which

103
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
will again we will look at the next

104
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,239
section in the brief

105
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,400
now once you know that you have a threat

106
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
map once you've started doing your recon

107
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,519
now it's time to perform manual pen test

108
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,360
while your automation happens in the

109
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,159
background

110
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,080
right in the manual pen test you will

111
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
fire your tools like burp suit

112
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
or any other proxy tool that you prefer

113
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
and then you will start testing every

114
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,000
single functionality for every single

115
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,239
test case like if there is a

116
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
authentication mechanism you might test

117
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,599
for sql injection you might test for

118
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,200
direct request you might test for eye

119
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,840
dots or

120
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,599
some other issues like oatmeal

121
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,760
configuration if applicable

122
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,319
now further you might need to perform

123
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,400
application specific attacks

124
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
now application specific attack might be

125
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,159
like the application is using

126
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,319
java so there might be a possibility of

127
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,239
java dc relation issues

128
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,640
application is built upon ruby so there

129
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,239
might be some rupee gadgets and d

130
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,599
simulation issues

131
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,760
you have to be specific as per the

132
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,799
application

133
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,680
apart from the generic wasp top 10 or

134
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,799
sense25

135
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
there can be any category of the bug

136
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,560
that might exist

137
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,440
further you can go based upon what is

138
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,120
the use case of the application

139
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
if it's an e-commerce application or if

140
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,880
it's a financial application

141
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
you might need to be specific according

142
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,400
to that test case

143
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
or that use case now

144
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,000
make sure that whenever you are doing

145
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,360
this you always

146
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
learn what you lack there is a lot of

147
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,440
times i i feel like i am less confident

148
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
in maybe sql injection

149
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,360
so i should go back spend some time on

150
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,960
learning sql injection

151
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,479
and again come back and hit on the

152
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,040
target now one thing that i would like

153
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
to mention

154
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
over here is never get into lab

155
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,960
mentality

156
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,040
because a lot of time beginners get into

157
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
lab mentality and they never feel

158
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,639
that much comfortable testing real

159
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
application and they get demotivated

160
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,240
easily because they are not finding

161
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
anything out there

162
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,919
labs are designed in such a way that

163
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,720
they will be

164
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,840
hackable and somewhere we have

165
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,320
like a mindset a mentality in our mind

166
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,759
running that okay this is something

167
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,960
hackable right

168
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
so just make sure that you don't get

169
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,080
into lab mentality

170
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,560
that it's easy that's that's what you

171
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,759
will see in the real life

172
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,840
real life is totally different from that

173
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,400
experience

174
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
now further threat mapping threat

175
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
mapping is something which a lot of

176
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
people

177
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,600
might not know or might miss basically

178
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
threat mapping is

179
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,639
totally a different process than the

180
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,080
regular pen testing but

181
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
why you should use it because it will

182
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
give you a better

183
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
approach a better view to look at your

184
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,639
target now uh let me tell you why

185
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,880
when you navigate the application you

186
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,479
know that what all the workflows

187
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,680
application has

188
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
what all the possible end points

189
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
functions components

190
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
or whatever application holes or

191
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,639
applications consist of

192
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,759
now suppose there is a function a what

193
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,080
if

194
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,919
you theoretically imagine the attack

195
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,919
scenario for that function a

196
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,960
so say an attacker can uh you know

197
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,840
delete for

198
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,720
the a function from user b's account or

199
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,280
an attacker can basically you know

200
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,080
pop up an xss or payload or something

201
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
else into the a functionality something

202
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,479
like that

203
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,120
right so having a mindset about each

204
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
functionality will give you a good idea

205
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,520
about possible test cases

206
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,319
right so threat mapping helps you to

207
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,360
understand

208
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
that what could be the possible test

209
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
cases for each applications

210
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,360
each functionalities and each component

211
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,840
now how you go about threat mapping

212
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,600
so threat mapping threat modeling

213
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,199
hunting they are like totally a

214
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,319
different process

215
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,440
but to again like make it a

216
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
very quickly easy to understand and

217
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,599
possible for everyone to implement

218
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,720
i have again divided into five steps

219
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,360
navigate the application while you are

220
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,240
navigating

221
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
list down all the components and the

222
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,520
functionalities

223
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,199
once you have all the components in the

224
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,560
functionalities

225
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
write down theoretical attack scenarios

226
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,919
for each function

227
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,800
like so like i said like for a function

228
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
i can do this

229
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,759
i can do that i can perform xss i can go

230
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,360
from sql injection

231
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
okay you you will have to create some

232
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,759
theoretical attack scenarios

233
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
create possible impact scenarios based

234
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,840
upon what is the impact upon

235
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,880
confidentiality

236
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,919
integrity and availability and

237
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,400
can an attacker perform create operation

238
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
or read operation or update

239
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,440
operation or delete operation on a

240
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,759
particular function so for example there

241
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,319
is a

242
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,360
card functionality so what we can say

243
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,919
is it possible for an attacker to add

244
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,639
something

245
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
to another user's card now this is

246
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,800
something called create you are creating

247
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
a card

248
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
is it possible for an attacker to read

249
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,039
something from other users card

250
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,720
this is you are doing viewing read

251
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,240
functionality abuse

252
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
can you update somebody else card you

253
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
are abusing update

254
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
can you delete something from the other

255
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,639
person's card

256
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,360
it is abusing the d so basically if you

257
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,720
are looking at the current

258
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,440
impact scenario and ci impact scenario

259
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,400
you can again

260
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,919
you know narrow down those theoretical

261
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
attack scenario for

262
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
better test plan now you will have a

263
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
wide set of test cases to perform on

264
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
your pen testing or your bug boundary

265
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,479
assessment whatever you are doing

266
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,639
now make sure that you verify all those

267
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,240
test cases while you perform your

268
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,960
assessment

269
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
and it will be guaranteeing you that

270
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,479
there will be

271
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,639
a high chance that you won't miss

272
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,599
anything

273
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,719
anything obvious at least right now

274
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,440
once you move out of uh threat mapping

275
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,880
we have to move towards

276
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,839
manual pen testing approach again the

277
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,440
important thing is

278
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,839
understand the application workflow so

279
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,680
if it's an e-commerce application

280
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
what is the workflow of uh you know

281
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,000
purchasing some product so you might

282
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
need to go to login

283
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,519
to a particular panel then you have to

284
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,880
go to some particular product

285
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,440
add some quantity then you know add

286
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,120
address and everything every shipping

287
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,480
details and everything and then you have

288
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,200
to

289
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,240
check out and is it possible to you know

290
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,560
break the workflow somewhere and do some

291
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,399
malicious tasks so

292
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,240
understand the applications workflow

293
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
what are the normal usual workflows the

294
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,680
application offers

295
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,640
then like you know run your brain to do

296
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
some mischievous tasks that

297
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
hey is it possible to break the scenario

298
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,480
in any possible way

299
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
secondly figure out the various possible

300
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,800
flows of the same feature

301
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,440
now it might be possible that add to

302
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
cart functionality or purchasing

303
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
something might have

304
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,560
some you know different workflows like

305
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
you can go to a new product

306
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,200
you can add it to the card and you can

307
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
purchase it or maybe you can go to your

308
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,080
wish list and directly purchase a

309
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,959
product from there

310
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,680
so there might be multiple workflows for

311
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
a single function it is a purchase over

312
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,320
here

313
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,880
try to break those application flows

314
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,000
test every possible

315
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
test case for each individual

316
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,440
functionality like uh test like

317
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
accesses for every single input point or

318
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
every single end point where you

319
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,959
feel like data might be reflected or

320
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,519
data might be stored somewhere

321
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,600
do not miss any test case even if it's

322
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
complicated

323
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
try it go out of your comfort zone if

324
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
you feel like i'm not good with ecstasy

325
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
try it it's there is nothing bad in

326
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,079
trying you will learn a lot of things

327
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,519
along the way

328
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,560
rely less upon the tools proxy tools are

329
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,800
really good go in terms of manual pen

330
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,920
testing

331
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
again learn something new if you are

332
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,600
stuck at something and again start

333
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
hacking

334
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,640
i would again emphasize that don't make

335
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
a lab mentality instead

336
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,040
learn something apply in one or two laps

337
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,760
at max

338
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
and start hacking in the real life

339
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,519
applications because the more you will

340
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,519
hack on the labs the more comfortable

341
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
you will be with the labs only

342
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,079
instead of being into the real

343
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,560
environment

344
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
now let's jump to my favorite topic

345
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,920
recon 101 i have given a lot of talks

346
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,200
before on recon

347
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
so again i will be quickly going through

348
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
this particular phase

349
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,959
so recon is nothing but increasing your

350
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,120
attack surface discovering and creating

351
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
a better attack surface

352
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
so that you know you can find more and

353
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,839
more security issues you can

354
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,880
uncover more vulnerabilities looking at

355
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,959
the less travel road is going to give

356
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,399
you more success

357
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,480
so if you are able to you know widen

358
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
your scope to a great extent

359
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,040
there is a huge possibility that other

360
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
people might not have done that already

361
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
and there is a huge possibility that you

362
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
will get valid works

363
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,120
digging assets of your target to the

364
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,480
deepest point possible

365
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,279
is the ultimate aim of the recon again

366
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:29,760
recon

367
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,320
is not equal to security issues but it

368
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,720
will increase the probability of getting

369
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,120
security issues the valid ones instead

370
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,079
of duplicates

371
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,920
now busting some myths over here recon

372
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
equals to bugs no recon is not directly

373
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
equals to bugs

374
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
rather it's equals to asset discovery

375
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,320
and increasing your attack surface

376
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,160
which will enable you to find more and

377
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
more bugs

378
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
people say that rickon is all about

379
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
manual approach but

380
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,519
no the best way to perform recon is to

381
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,880
use hybrid approach

382
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,920
using both automation and manual so

383
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,360
uh there are a lot of things which you

384
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,120
can automate like subdomain enumeration

385
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,680
domain takeovers and other things

386
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,120
however there are things like

387
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
github recon google docking which still

388
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,839
like you are searching on showdown or

389
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,839
something they still need manual

390
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,279
intervention to you know

391
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,560
be better people again say that recon is

392
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,800
time consuming but if you perform it

393
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
properly and automate things in a right

394
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
way you can save a lot of times

395
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,360
what you can do is you can create your

396
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,320
own scripts

397
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,240
to automate say some domain enumeration

398
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,519
subdomain takeovers

399
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,920
some particular fuzzing and all and then

400
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,200
at the same time you can start

401
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,040
performing manual github recon manual

402
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,800
google docking or

403
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
if this github recon is not in scope you

404
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
can directly jump into performing manual

405
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,680
pen testing right so you are doing two

406
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,120
things in the parallel

407
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,920
saving a lot of time people think that

408
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,600
recon is all equals to subdomain

409
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
enumeration who is sport scanning

410
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
fuzzing etc

411
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,240
but this is not the case it's all about

412
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,120
how creative you could be like where all

413
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,040
you can go and possibly look for the

414
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,600
you know exposed credentials or maybe

415
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
anything which will

416
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,720
enable you to increase the attack

417
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
surface

418
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
yeah this is true that these abu methods

419
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
are some of the uh well-known methods

420
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,200
but

421
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,680
never limited security is a beautiful

422
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
field which is never limited to anything

423
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,279
every single day there's a lot of

424
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
research coming out there's a lot of new

425
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
tools and techniques coming out so yeah

426
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
it's it's never ending and never limited

427
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,920
now now again talking about one of the

428
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,800
uh my own approach the scope-based recon

429
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,360
which

430
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
simply is a methodology to divide how to

431
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,440
perform recon

432
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
when a specific scope is provided and

433
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:50,720
this is very much

434
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,199
important actually because if you are

435
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,800
blindly performing every single

436
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,639
reconnaissance thing on every kind of

437
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,120
scope

438
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,040
this is not going to give you a good

439
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,199
result you might go out of scope you

440
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,959
might waste a lot of time

441
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,959
but on the other hand if you know your

442
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,160
scope and if you know that

443
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
what you have to do in a specific set of

444
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,360
scope

445
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
you will be good to go you will be

446
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,639
knowing that okay what i have to look

447
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,199
for

448
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,120
where i have to look for and what i will

449
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,800
be finding after it

450
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,680
now there are basically three type of

451
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,959
scoops

452
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,040
when we talk about scope based recon the

453
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
small scope the medium scope and the

454
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,399
large scope

455
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,360
now why is scope based recon it saves a

456
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,000
lot of time

457
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
because you know that what specific

458
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
things you want to look for

459
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,000
you can easily automate your own recon

460
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
workflow you can just you know

461
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
okay in your small scope record you just

462
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
want to do subdomain enumeration and

463
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
subdomain

464
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
takeovers you can write a small script

465
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,519
using four or five tools

466
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,440
for subdomain enumeration and then you

467
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
can you know just simply probe them and

468
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,720
send it to

469
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,440
the subdomain takeover tools and try to

470
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,839
see

471
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,040
if it's working for you there are less

472
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
chance to submit out of scope issues

473
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,880
and just like other security

474
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,040
methodologies it enables you to perform

475
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,199
a better reconnaissance

476
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,440
now let's quickly look at the small

477
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,959
scope medium scope and the large scope

478
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,959
recon

479
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,040
so when we talk about small scope recon

480
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,160
we specifically

481
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,279
look for specific set of urls it may be

482
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,199
sandbox url queue or staging

483
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
environments like you will see a lot of

484
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,199
time

485
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,839
sendbox.target.com or

486
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,000
qastaging.target.com

487
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
medium scope we consider star.target.com

488
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,000
where we say that all the subdomain of

489
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,920
target.com are in scope

490
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
where in large scope we consider that

491
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,040
every single thing

492
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
the internet presents acquisitions

493
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,079
copyright everything

494
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,680
related to that organization will be in

495
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,199
school

496
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
now in small scope recall let's let's

497
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,320
look like

498
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
what we have to look for while

499
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,440
performing the recon so

500
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
these are the few common things that you

501
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
should look for like directory

502
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,399
enumeration and brute forcing

503
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
first the directories to the possible uh

504
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,399
end points do it recursively

505
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,600
uh a lot of time slash admin directory

506
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
might give you four zero three errors or

507
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
four or one errors or something like

508
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,959
that but if you're trying to do it

509
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,759
recursively

510
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,160
you might find a direct say slash admin

511
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,240
slash data or slash admin slash data

512
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,800
slash

513
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
usernames and which might not be

514
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,399
protected

515
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,639
perform service enumeration to see what

516
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,480
services are powering up your system and

517
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
you can further check if there is some

518
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
cvs for that or any public expert for

519
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,440
that

520
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
perform port scanning if it's in scope

521
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,839
to check for you know other quotes

522
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,600
uh perform broken link hijacking it's

523
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,519
again like subdomain takeover but here

524
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,800
like there might be some

525
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
social media links or some third party

526
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,959
links which can be taken over

527
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,920
look for js files for hard-coded api

528
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
secrets and credentials

529
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
perform parameter discovery and automate

530
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,000
for the xss and

531
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
other tools perform way back history way

532
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
back urls google

533
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,399
docking to you know look for the

534
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,480
potential

535
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,639
endpoints and urls to further see what

536
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,079
you can possibly do

537
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,880
you can use various gf patterns to end

538
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
and automation scripts to automate

539
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
accesses ssrf and other

540
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,319
tools now that last point totally

541
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,280
depends upon

542
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,359
how you want to automate things here

543
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,879
automation plays a really good role

544
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,359
now let's look at medium scope recon

545
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,359
in medium scope recon the most of the

546
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,959
things stay same

547
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,599
except for a few like here we look at

548
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,400
subdomain enumeration because

549
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,119
star.target.com is in scope so

550
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,240
subdominant animation is

551
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,320
really important further you can perform

552
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
subdomain takeovers you can check for

553
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,160
misconfigured third party services

554
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
you can check for misconfigured storage

555
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,840
options like s3 worked

556
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
you can go for github recon and a lot of

557
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
time we find a lot of good things on

558
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,640
itunes

559
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,280
and further you can perform google doc

560
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,720
for increasing the attack surface

561
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
finding more sub domains

562
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
you can perform internet search engine

563
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,080
discovery using

564
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,280
showdown sensors for binary agent spice

565
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,080
spice is

566
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,160
a new yet good tool i i use it

567
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
personally for a long time now

568
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,919
showdown and spice are the two tools

569
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,360
which i prefer to have in my arsenal

570
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,200
again potential url extraction for

571
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,640
vulnerability automation is the same

572
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,440
like we did before

573
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,200
and in the large scope recon this is the

574
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,880
favorite part that you know

575
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,080
there's a lot of things that you can

576
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
basically do and this is where

577
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,480
i did something uh for one of the

578
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
private program on the book crowd and i

579
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,600
i got from like say thousand rank to 200

580
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,720
in just a month time right so tracking

581
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
addressing every possible signature of

582
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,600
the target

583
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,039
application like trace trace and track

584
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:35,679
like okay

585
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,200
after 10 days there might be some new

586
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,720
subdomains coming there might be some

587
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,240
new acquisitions happening

588
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,919
there might be some new branding of that

589
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,679
particular target might be launched

590
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,360
there might be some companion websites

591
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,960
of that target might be launched

592
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,039
so when we say large scope record every

593
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,200
single thing would mean

594
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,360
perform enumeration on subsidiaries and

595
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,320
acquisitions

596
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,360
so go to the maximum depth so say you

597
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,559
are performing uh

598
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,880
subsidiary enumeration on target so

599
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,400
target might have a

600
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,240
substitute called target1.com which

601
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,600
again might have a substitute called

602
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,799
target2.com

603
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,600
so now you have to again go to

604
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,840
target2.com

605
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
everything in target2.com target1.com

606
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,400
will also mean scope

607
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
you can go and check for dns and ssl

608
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,520
enumeration

609
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
asn and ipspace enumeration further like

610
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,200
you can

611
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
go for github recon and there you can

612
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,559
find a lot of things on github

613
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,240
because you know every single thing

614
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
every employees profile will also be in

615
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,559
scope and

616
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,520
if they are you know specifically uh

617
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
using some assets

618
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,080
which are related to again target you

619
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,919
can utilize internet search engines over

620
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,400
here

621
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,799
in a very beautiful way and there might

622
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,760
be uh

623
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
various methods not just limited to them

624
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
but these are some of the things that

625
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,320
you should

626
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,840
and must look for now this concludes the

627
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,960
most of the part of

628
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,520
uh small medium and large scope recon

629
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,240
now let's

630
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
look at some of the offensive come smart

631
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
recon tactics these are like again very

632
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,360
short tactics as i always tell people

633
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
whenever you're doing recall just choose

634
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,960
your scope and based on that

635
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
choose your scope based recon method

636
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,200
create a script for automating your

637
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,320
scope is recall

638
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
i have created a project called project

639
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
beam over github you can go to github

640
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,559
and

641
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,039
search for it and you can ultimately try

642
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,000
to see if it

643
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
it fulfills your need for scope based

644
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,520
recon in project beam we

645
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,080
introduce the scope based recon feature

646
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,679
so you have to just say that i want to

647
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,600
do small scope recon or medium or large

648
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,320
scope econ

649
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,559
so it will do the task accordingly which

650
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,159
are pretty defined

651
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,919
run your automation scripts over cloud

652
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,760
because it's fast it will save your

653
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,640
system's

654
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
processing powers so that while you are

655
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,919
performing burp suit

656
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,280
testing with burp suit and some other

657
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,400
tools you won't face any lags

658
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,320
manually perform bitcoin on github and

659
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
perform searching and docking manually

660
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
while your automation completes or

661
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
you can also uh you know perform manual

662
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,360
pen testing while your automation

663
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,480
completes

664
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,400
you can further create cron jobs or

665
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,799
schedulers to rerun the recon

666
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,280
task to identify new assets on a

667
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,720
specific time interval

668
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,880
and again compare those and see okay now

669
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,559
after one month there are 10 new sub

670
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,640
domains and i have 10 fresh targets to

671
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,280
look for

672
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
in a program implement alerts or push

673
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,600
for slack or preferred mode so that

674
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
every time you are finding some new

675
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,480
assets you will be notified

676
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
so doing all these things try to

677
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
implement those things by your own

678
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,240
i i highly recommend because project

679
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,600
game is also

680
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,240
not something very big it's just again a

681
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,679
bash script

682
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,840
with a collection of pre-existing tools

683
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,960
only so

684
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,640
try to write your own tools like that

685
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,240
way it will give you a really good

686
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
experience because when i wrote beam

687
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,480
i i got a really good experience about a

688
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
lot of things which i was not aware of

689
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,200
before

690
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,360
managing a lot of things and you know

691
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
how to put all the things together

692
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,760
