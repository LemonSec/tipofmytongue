00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,000
hello everybody and

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,040
uh welcome to the uh red team village uh

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,400
declassified web app

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,440
location hacking 101. this is an

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,480
essentials course

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,639
it is meant to be for a beginner someone

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,160
that has never been

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
uh or never have uh experienced any

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,720
uh work in web application hacking

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,560
you're probably gonna ask why would i

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
want to

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
do web app application hacking or you

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,720
have an idea so

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
web application hacking has a lot of

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,840
things

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,000
a lot of capabilities so it's a gateway

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,079
to a lot of different careers

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,840
including bug bounty hunting which is a

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,079
really big thing companies pay a lot of

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,360
money

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,640
for you to be able to look for issues in

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,719
their websites and databases

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,559
and systems that they have exposed on

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,800
the internet and they pay good money for

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,120
you to find vulnerabilities

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,239
it doesn't even have to be a very

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,719
complex vulnerability it could just be

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,039
some type of input validation thing that

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,399
can maybe lead to

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,479
um you know some cross-site scripting or

31
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,438
something

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,320
those type of bugs uh people are finding

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
all the time and cashing in on them some

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,960
of them are

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,360
you know pretty low dollar down to 500

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,720
bucks some of them are

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
uh some of the more complicated ones are

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,040
in the thousands of dollars

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,720
a lot of people make a really good

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
living off of bug bounty hunting

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
um and you can too the other the other

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,119
reason you might be interested in this

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,040
is uh your company

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,439
has a bunch of programmers or maybe

45
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,479
you're a programmer

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,880
and you want to learn more about um you

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,840
know doing

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
validated code so this course

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
will help you from the start out in the

50
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,920
very beginning

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
of that uh career uh so i'm gonna have

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,759
to do the disclaimer

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,000
um at the beginning of this so this

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,960
training is is

55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
intended for educational purposes only

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,079
if you attempt

57
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
any of these techniques uh without

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
proper authorization

59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,759
um you're likely to get caught and if

60
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,880
you're caught engaged in

61
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,119
unauthorized hacking uh most companies

62
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,079
will fire you

63
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,159
and or place you under arrest um

64
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,520
claiming you're doing it for

65
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,759
research or for security or for

66
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,520
practicing or

67
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,599
learning is is not going to be a good

68
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,879
excuse for them

69
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,959
you're basically you basically could end

70
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,480
up destroying some

71
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
uh valuable data on the corporate

72
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
network at the very least you become an

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
untrusted member of the team

74
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
because they're worried about you doing

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
going rogue and doing weird things so

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,000
my suggestion is use this lab use this

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
lab guide and the vm

78
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,720
and work on those there's a lot of

79
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
frameworks included in this

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,440
vm that uh that's up on the website and

81
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
um you know continue learning and uh and

82
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
building your skills

83
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,800
so um this uh this website is

84
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
um evocorp.biz where we're hosting all

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,640
of the

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,120
most of the program um is there and the

87
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,760
reason

88
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,080
um that we use that was uh we're kind of

89
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
doing a pun on the whole you know

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,319
uh everything's every big corporation's

91
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,200
evil

92
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,239
um so if you wanna if you wanna um learn

93
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,440
more about this just go to number three

94
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
web app hacking 101 um click on that

95
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,920
it'll take you to the main web page that

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,720
will have the

97
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,239
a lab guide the one i'm going through

98
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,400
right now it also has a vm that you can

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,120
download

100
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,120
this vm is based on um deb on debian

101
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,560
uh it's coors debian um it is kali linux

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,959
a certain version of kali linux and uh

103
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,319
it's uh roared up

104
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,120
um basically you can use 7zip or unrard

105
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,599
on rarit and the password's root there

106
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,920
download this machine before you get

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
started

108
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
or before you do the lab so back to the

109
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,400
lab guide

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
so what we're doing is we're teaching

111
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,080
you basically to go

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,120
from a a very um

113
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
new person with uh very little skills

114
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,920
when it comes to web app hacking uh

115
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,319
up to a maybe a medium level level of

116
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,959
skills

117
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,000
um so we're so this is a 101 course if

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
you've done anything with any app any

119
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,760
other type of

120
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
web app hacking this will probably um

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,599
just be a little too easy for you

122
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,680
um we intended this course to be the

123
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,720
first part

124
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,280
uh in a series of courses for uh

125
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,159
learning

126
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,160
um web app application hacking and then

127
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,918
venturing into the back end of the

128
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,358
system like sql

129
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,880
injection on the back end and stuff like

130
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,520
that so if you follow along with this

131
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
you'll see in about another month uh

132
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,880
we'll post um

133
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,280
an update to the vm and an update to the

134
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,320
lab guide

135
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,800
uh that will have a lot more uh sql

136
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,360
injection

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
type stuff in it um and other injection

138
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,199
types

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
um so um you don't have to download rvm

140
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
you can build your own test environment

141
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,360
we included everything in this lab guide

142
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,160
that you need

143
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
to be able to build your own lab

144
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,919
environment um if

145
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,160
the if the if you're in a country where

146
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,280
the internet's terrible

147
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
and you already have cali you can just

148
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,960
download the scripts and use those

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,759
and run the the vm so this is a virtual

150
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,880
operating system

151
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
the what you're going to download is a

152
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
vm it'll run under

153
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
virtualbox or it'll run under vmware

154
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
workstation vmware fusion

155
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,080
you should be able to run it in under

156
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
any of those so what is a vm

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,039
a vm is a computer file um they call it

158
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,560
an image it behaves a lot like a

159
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
computer because

160
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
basically it is a it is a computer

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,720
you can run multiple virtual machines

162
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,759
simultaneously

163
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,759
on one machine so if you look on

164
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,960
background here i'm running

165
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,160
a vmware workstation and i have a whole

166
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
host of different vms here that

167
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919
that i'm hosting and right now i have

168
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,440
like two vms up

169
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,000
but i can run more vms the only uh

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
difficulty with that is

171
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320
um every vm that i start i take memory

172
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,080
away from my main machine that i'm

173
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,479
running

174
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,720
and what i'm doing other things on so

175
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,320
you can get to a point where you have

176
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,759
too many vms loaded

177
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,240
and and everything's acting sluggish

178
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,199
because remember

179
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
your these vms are basically carving uh

180
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
services out of existing systems so

181
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,000
including memory uh hard drive and cpu

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,479
time so these are things that are

183
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,639
abstracted from the actual host

184
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,000
carved out and like i mentioned the more

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,960
that you build

186
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
the more degradation you'll see in your

187
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,280
system so here's links to the different

188
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,199
software virtualbox is free you can

189
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,319
download it from

190
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,520
from oracle uh vmware workstation pro

191
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,520
is uh um it's not that expensive but uh

192
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
you're gonna have to pay for it and

193
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,039
vmware fusion is for mac

194
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,000
mac books so if you have a mac you run

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,400
that

196
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
you can also run this under hyper-v or

197
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,479
kvm um and then there are some

198
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,199
uh vm um solutions online including

199
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,639
microsoft says year

200
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,680
and under amazon you can you can run it

201
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,280
under amazon as well

202
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,919
so the so that's uh the virtual machine

203
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,199
i'm going to show you the comparison

204
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,400
between virtual machine

205
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,960
and container this this entire lab is

206
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,000
built on

207
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
a lot of containers a container is an

208
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,759
abstract of an

209
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,080
application running in a virtualized

210
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
operating system one or more common

211
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,840
container types is docker a container is

212
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
a

213
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,000
standard unit of software packages up to

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,639
code

215
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,720
and all of its dependencies so the

216
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
application runs quickly and reliably

217
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,240
from one computing environment to the

218
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
next so um

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,599
to put this simply you can see the

220
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,720
difference here between a virtual

221
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
machine and a container

222
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,280
a container is not reliant a container

223
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
doesn't is the application basically not

224
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,039
the operating system

225
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,199
it uses the underlying operating system

226
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,160
for all of the rest

227
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
all of its capabilities and functions

228
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,680
whereas in a virtual machine

229
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
everything the os is loaded the

230
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,759
application's loaded

231
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
and all of them have that dependency on

232
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
on an entire machine

233
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,680
and then those run on a hypervisor and

234
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,759
then your physical infrastructure

235
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,240
whereas your containers run on top of

236
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,800
docker

237
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,879
and then the host operating system and

238
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,639
then the infrastructure so you notice

239
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,280
the difference

240
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,560
missing here is a hypervisor so

241
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,400
um like i mentioned almost all of the uh

242
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
systems that we have on here all of the

243
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
can all of the uh

244
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
exploitable vms and tools and everything

245
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
are built into containers so

246
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,720
you'll get you'll get used to starting

247
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,800
and stopping uh containers

248
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,280
um it's pretty easy um we're using a

249
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,120
debian platform so it's basically

250
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,599
a service docker start or system control

251
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,639
start docker

252
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,080
those two will start it and then the

253
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,759
same thing with stopping it service

254
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
docker stop

255
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,679
will work as well so what we've included

256
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,719
in the vm

257
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,958
that you downloaded was exploitable vms

258
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,799
um you can download explore the

259
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,480
metasploitable 2 which has been out for

260
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,360
a really long time

261
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,440
it's an awesome framework it has a lot

262
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
of relevant

263
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,839
material on it um the oas matilda day

264
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,800
and the wa the damn vulnerable web

265
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
application those are

266
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
two very popular ones if you're getting

267
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,519
into a lot of php

268
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,560
um the php my admin um

269
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,920
vm also is is pretty awesome um and the

270
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,200
credentials are here

271
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
metasploitable 3 is a little bit more

272
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
complicated because it uses packer and

273
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,760
vagrant

274
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,360
and has a lot of dependencies so if

275
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440
you're running on debian

276
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,519
i have not found a container of this yet

277
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,200
so you basically have to install this

278
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
directly onto the system

279
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
but it ends up running a windows uh 2003

280
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,680
i think instance so

281
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,240
it's pretty cool um but like i mentioned

282
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,040
has some

283
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,959
uh dependencies that might be a problem

284
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,320
for you if you're new starting out on

285
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,040
this

286
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,680
um and then the olas juice shop is

287
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,959
pretty cool because

288
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,040
it is almost it's set up like a regular

289
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,720
store that you would find on the

290
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,519
internet

291
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,160
um with products and services and a

292
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,240
checkout card and all that stuff so

293
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
pretty cool to look at that um this

294
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,839
you'll want to get into later on down

295
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,920
the line when you're working on it

296
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,560
um you can there is a docker container

297
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,839
for the juice shop

298
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,880
i do show it here it is not um hooked up

299
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,279
it's not linked in the in the script

300
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,160
file that i'm gonna

301
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,560
provide for you in the in the lab um

302
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,320
there and then there's also a

303
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
a self-healing version of it that allows

304
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,839
you to um

305
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
basically run through some exercises and

306
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,120
then reset it

307
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,320
so that's pretty cool as well um a new

308
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,680
um system that's out it's a dvna the

309
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
damn vulnerable node.js a lot of

310
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
websites are running this now so i

311
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
thought that would be relevant to throw

312
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,680
that in here

313
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,480
is maybe the next step towards after you

314
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,680
finish this lab guide

315
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
start looking into that framework i did

316
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,519
mention websploit

317
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,120
web split would probably be your next

318
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
step after doing this lab

319
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,440
moving over to that one this is by omar

320
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,600
santos a friend of mine

321
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
and it includes probably about

322
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
50 containers with a lot of

323
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,040
different vulnerable software and

324
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
frameworks in it

325
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,920
i think he said something like 500

326
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,320
different exercises are available to run

327
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,279
on that so that

328
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,120
that might be your next step after here

329
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,560
i do mention a waf a

330
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
web application firewall only because as

331
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
you continue down this path of web

332
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,079
application testing

333
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,240
um and looking for vulnerabilities

334
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
you're invariably going to run into

335
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,600
firewalls and wafts and what wafts do

336
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,959
is protect um applications

337
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,839
um that may be coded kind of crappy um

338
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,600
or where they took too many shortcuts

339
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,000
and it basically acts as kind of like a

340
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
buffer between

341
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,880
the user or the attacker and then the

342
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,000
actual back end system so this talks a

343
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,800
little bit about it

344
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,079
um and shows you a little bit of about

345
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,920
how testing how you can test it to see

346
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,720
if the

347
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,320
the system your test you're that you're

348
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,079
going to look at potentially testing

349
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,560
is behind a waffle it tells you that for

350
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,079
example this one says the way

351
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,920
that our website is behind behind

352
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,440
cloudflare

353
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,200
and cloudflare's is providing those waff

354
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,399
capabilities so pretty a pretty cool uh

355
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,519
technology

356
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
coming that you'll be eventually getting

357
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,680
into um so the two frameworks that we're

358
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
mainly going to work with in this lab

359
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
are bwap

360
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,480
and web goat seven so bwap's an

361
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,800
extremely buggy web application

362
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
um it was uh it's it's old um i can't

363
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,920
tell you how old but um it's in its

364
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,440
third revision

365
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,560
and um it it's been out for a while uh

366
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
it is a great starting point if you're

367
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,800
just getting into web application

368
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,440
um testing and and wanting to do more

369
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,639
with bug bounties

370
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,519
um and web goat seven is a deliberately

371
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,279
insecure web application

372
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,920
uh there's web go dates out now i

373
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,040
specifically have

374
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
uh seven listed here and we use do

375
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,399
exercises with seven

376
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,760
just because we're trying to stay away

377
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,320
from uh from tools as much as possible

378
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,000
and teaching you the hands-on components

379
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,720
of this

380
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,920
um the next iteration of this guide um

381
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,600
part two we'll get into

382
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,639
into more tools um which you'll

383
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,880
look you'll see will come in handy and

384
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,240
shortcut a lot of the stuff that you're

385
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,839
going to be doing by hand here

386
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,639
um so what about red teams um so a lot

387
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,399
of people have misconceptions about red

388
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,320
teams red teams work hand in hand

389
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
with blue teams to improve a

390
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,600
corporation's

391
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,639
um uh you know posture

392
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,560
uh when it comes to cyber security and

393
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,680
whatever they have

394
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,959
uh external facing um red teams um

395
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,200
in this in this guide you're gonna find

396
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,959
out about red team

397
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,600
adversarial tactics and part of that is

398
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
you know tactic techniques

399
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
techniques and procedures ttps and

400
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
they'll be mentioned throughout this

401
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
course

402
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,560
um and you know it'll talk a lot about

403
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,519
red

404
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,959
effective red team operations and

405
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,800
communications that are necessary

406
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,279
for a red team to work uh closely

407
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,000
together

408
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
and provide that value to the

409
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,199
corporation um

410
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,800
that they that they're able to defend

411
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
themselves and their blue team is able

412
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,639
to defend themselves your

413
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,480
the purpose of the red team is not to go

414
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,800
and like beat the heck out of the

415
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,199
um the blue team it's to make sure that

416
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,399
the blue team can

417
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,519
see the attack happening and figure out

418
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,199
better ways to detect it

419
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,560
and then be able to respond to it um so

420
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,680
within this guide

421
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
we're gonna there's you're gonna see a

422
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,320
lot of different things around

423
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,519
vulnerability system

424
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,320
assessments penetration testing run time

425
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,120
testing

426
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,760
uh code review and then uh red teaming

427
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,399
includes

428
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,959
a lot of these components together a

429
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,680
risk

430
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,639
assessment is commonly commonly listed

431
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,399
as part of a security testing

432
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,000
um it's not included in this list

433
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,240
because a risk assessment

434
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,320
does not actually test anything is just

435
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,600
a list of

436
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,160
uh perceived uh severities of different

437
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,120
risks like when

438
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,399
after they do the um uh

439
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,000
vulnerability assessment they provide

440
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
that and then they go through it so

441
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,320
um so red team methodology is showing

442
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,199
you right here

443
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,720
um we're not going to get into a lot of

444
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
this other than to say

445
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
once you get into doing more red teaming

446
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
you're going to spend a lot of time on

447
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
reconnaissance and weaponization before

448
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,959
you

449
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,360
um kind of go through the rest of these

450
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,639
there's a lot of tools now that

451
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,680
basically help you

452
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,199
you know do point and click of delivery

453
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,880
and exploitation

454
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,959
but you've kind of need to learn those

455
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,279
as you go through red teaming

456
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,040
and part of that's like exploit

457
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
development um so this training course

458
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,000
can be

459
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,839
um can be attained online uh at

460
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,560
evilcorp.biz

461
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,240
the website has a wealth of materials

462
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,560
including shortcuts and

463
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,360
other codes that you can use to help

464
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,279
when you're doing testing

465
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,720
so the first chapter we're going to

466
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
cover on the on web application

467
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,920
vulnerabilities

468
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,000
is html injection an html injection

469
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,440
takes place when there's

470
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
you've come across a form that asks you

471
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,680
for a user id and a password or

472
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,199
maybe your first name and last name

473
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,040
and what you basically do is instead of

474
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
putting in like uh

475
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,360
legible characters like you know fred

476
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,600
sanford you end up putting in

477
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,560
some html code and try to get the web

478
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,199
form to

479
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,279
interpret that and then if it does then

480
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,800
you actually start crafting more and

481
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
more complicated

482
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,880
uh html code so that until you get it to

483
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,120
break and get you

484
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,880
data that you're looking for either from

485
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
the back end system or within the

486
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
the system in the front end system that

487
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
may have access to data

488
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,519
that is available that way as well

489
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,399
um so there's uh two main types of uh of

490
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:18,800
uh

491
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,320
html injection stored html code which

492
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,920
happens like in drive-bys and then

493
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
reflected html injection which is the

494
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,040
first thing that we're going to talk

495
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,920
about

496
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,120
which is basically code that is

497
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,279
it happens when you visit a website or

498
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,000
someone's

499
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,920
messing around with your web browser

500
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,040
you're going to see that it's very easy

501
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,399
to clear up

502
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
stored html code a little bit more

503
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,440
complicated because it's on the web

504
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,320
server side

505
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,240
it's being executed every time somebody

506
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,360
browses that out

507
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,639
to that page reflected

508
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,680
html injection types are get post and

509
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,360
the url type

510
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,519
this kind of shows you what an html

511
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,880
injection flow is

512
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,360
on the attacker basically injects

513
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,880
malicious script into the web

514
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,759
application

515
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,839
the attacker sees my cool pictures from

516
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
the victim basically so

517
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,359
that's kind of one way um the victim um

518
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,199
look see can see a login screen like

519
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,880
this it says hey here's all of

520
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
you know this stuff um you know your

521
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,959
username and your password log in here

522
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,160
so it's kind of almost like

523
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
similar to a man in the middle and then

524
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,679
you go ahead and put the data in and

525
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,959
then guess what that data ends up

526
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,240
getting sent to

527
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,679
uh the attacker so um that's

528
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,640
that's kind of the point of reflected

529
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,919
html injection

530
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,200
so i'm not going to go through all of

531
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,960
these i suggest that you read these

532
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,000
um closely because they they do uh cover

533
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,640
a lot

534
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,720
a lot of the methods um which i talk

535
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,840
about here

536
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,640
including the trace method used to echo

537
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
contents with an html request back to

538
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,760
the requester

539
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,720
um and um and then i talked a little bit

540
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,919
about

541
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,840
this right here where i showed a

542
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
wireshark capture

543
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,039
well this is kind of like the header you

544
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
can you can grab this with burp suite

545
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320
but i do have a an analysis farther down

546
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,640
in

547
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,200
in here so the very first lab that

548
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,919
you're going to do

549
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,039
is in chapter 2 it's on page 15. this

550
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,480
one's

551
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,160
basically to determine which method is

552
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
used by a website you can start

553
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,960
with checking the source code of the

554
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,200
webpage by right-clicking on the page

555
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,120
and doing basically inspect the webpage

556
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,840
and you can download the prepackaged

557
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,120
machines like i mentioned

558
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
on the website um when you go to log

559
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,480
into the website

560
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,679
um it's gonna i added this in here

561
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,799
because if you're not from

562
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,960
familiar with a vm you're gonna download

563
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,880
the vm expand it and then you're gonna

564
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,440
launch

565
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,039
a vmware workstation or virtualbox and

566
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,320
you do file open

567
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
and you're going to look for this red

568
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
team

569
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
vm and then you're going to click on the

570
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,160
power button and power the machine up

571
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,520
and answer the question that says was

572
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,480
this

573
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,799
machine uh moved or copied you basically

574
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,600
tell it that

575
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,360
it was copied and it will set it up

576
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,960
using your local network interfaces

577
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
to log in once you get the machine up

578
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
you're going to log in

579
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,120
to the red team vm with user and then

580
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,720
tour uh the

581
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,240
the the middle here is a zero zero so

582
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,520
it's not oo like in the default one

583
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,320
so you'll log in with root and uh tour

584
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
and you'll be right into right into the

585
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,360
vm

586
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,640
so after it launches and then you can

587
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,919
bring up the web browser

588
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,480
uh for more information so uh one of the

589
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,520
things that uh

590
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
that we worked on was um

591
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
a script that we beg borrowed steeled

592
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,520
and installed and modified and

593
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
put together um from all over the place

594
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,480
is this redteamlab.sh

595
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,000
script it's gonna take some of the fun

596
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,080
out of uh out of um

597
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,320
you know trying to run each one of these

598
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,520
individually

599
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,679
um so i'm gonna go ahead and bring that

600
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,640
up here real quick

601
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,159
i thought i had a window open already

602
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,000
so let me make this a little larger for

603
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
you to see

604
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,720
um i kind of do ifconfig

605
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
always on the machine to make sure that

606
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,400
i do have an ip address that i'm getting

607
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,039
out

608
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,640
i obviously was because i was getting

609
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,559
hitting the website

610
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,320
i'm going to try to make sure that this

611
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,000
screen actually

612
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,520
sizes a little better so you can see

613
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
what's going on hopefully you can see

614
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,080
that

615
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,600
um so um pwd shows where i'm at

616
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,200
so i'm in root this is where i want to

617
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
be i'm going to look at the directories

618
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
i do see red team lab in there so i'm

619
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,880
going to change into the red team lab

620
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,120
directory and then if i look in there i

621
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,559
see the script that i was talking about

622
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,799
the red team lab.sh

623
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,360
so you can go in and you can look at the

624
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,000
script with

625
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,919
more um but the red team um

626
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,559
red sox is funny so to start this we're

627
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,840
going to do a dot

628
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,440
a dot dot slash and then red team i'm

629
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
using tab complete in case you're

630
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,159
wondering why it

631
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,360
it ends up going out so fast like that

632
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,280
um and i do mention that here um you

633
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
should see

634
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,440
so you um so after that you change into

635
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,919
the directory red team lab which we did

636
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,679
and then to start uh the b web

637
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,919
application which is in a container

638
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,200
and we run the script start and then b

639
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,400
web so pretty simple start

640
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,400
and then b web

641
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,559
so basically what this does is it'll

642
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,440
punch in

643
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,640
some information into the host file

644
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,760
so that when i browse to

645
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,520
just that ip address or just the name

646
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
bwap it will

647
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,960
um automatically bring it up instead of

648
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,559
me having to look around for the

649
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,679
application so

650
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,520
a little bit of a shortcut thing there

651
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,080
for us um and then it tells us the

652
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,480
the username and the and the password b

653
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,600
and bug i mean that's

654
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,320
not super complicated there um so now

655
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,200
we're going to

656
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,080
um bring up our our web browser and i

657
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
created a shortcut for you right here

658
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,080
for the for b weapon the installation

659
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,280
you click on it

660
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,120
um it says installation click here to

661
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,480
install i click install it says

662
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,080
the database already exists of course it

663
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,840
does because it's been on the

664
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
on the vm uh the next thing we're going

665
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,240
to do is we're going to log in

666
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,000
so we're going to log in and we're going

667
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,159
to use uh b

668
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,360
and bug

669
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,600
and log in and now we have our um our

670
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,559
menu down here

671
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,640
um it's kind of interesting it has two

672
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,159
menus the second one's up here on the

673
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,080
top i typically use this one rather than

674
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,240
that one down there

675
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,720
um so so now following along in the lab

676
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,240
guide it says all activities going

677
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
forward uh will be done inside the vm

678
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,720
so i as you see i am my web browser is

679
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,679
inside the vm

680
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,000
and i'm browsing inside the vm i

681
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,840
executed all those commands inside the

682
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,360
vm

683
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,720
that's important because i've seen some

684
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
people launch a web browser on the

685
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,520
outside off their regular workstation

686
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,200
not get and not get anywhere

687
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
that's happening to you take a look and

688
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
see if you don't have your window

689
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,640
expanded for vm and that could be

690
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
potentially the problem

691
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,120
um so uh if you if you try starting b

692
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,600
whap um and you end up at a chinese

693
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,559
website

694
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,320
it's a good end indicator that you

695
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,240
missed a step usually not performing

696
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,799
starting b web so if you don't do what i

697
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,720
just showed you by clicking on the

698
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,919
installation um for it and then and then

699
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,799
do the installation and then logging in

700
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
if you try to go to bwap on its own it's

701
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
going to take you to a chinese website i

702
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,000
i don't remember exactly what was on the

703
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,200
page but

704
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,159
you probably don't want to go there um

705
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:40,720
so

706
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,320
this shows you that i clicked there the

707
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,279
installation then i logged in

708
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,360
my current security settings were set to

709
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,279
low if you look they're set to low right

710
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:49,600
here

711
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,400
it's matched up right here uh the first

712
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,120
actual lab

713
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,640
is a simple get html operation

714
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,279
um so after taking the inputs as it's

715
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,279
reflected on the webpage

716
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,200
this this is called html entity encoding

717
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
and it renders the html code so the

718
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,480
server attempter

719
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,520
attempts to record rectify the um

720
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,960
html injection process

721
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
so we're going to see that here we're

722
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,880
going to do we're gonna select html

723
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,919
injection get

724
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,120
so pretty simple go here it's the

725
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,000
second one down um i mean we are so this

726
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
top one is a heading of what type

727
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,640
of thing we're in we're in uh injections

728
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,000
if you keep scrolling down you're

729
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,039
going to see a2 is now broken off and

730
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,400
session management and a3 is cross-site

731
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,440
scripting

732
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,320
so um each one of these exercises that

733
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,960
we're going to do

734
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,400
under here is is under a1

735
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,080
uh to start out with so i do select that

736
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,799
um it's i mentioned a note here every

737
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,200
time

738
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,480
you select a new bug um reset and log

739
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,120
back in

740
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,799
um i think that's the easiest thing to

741
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,320
do to ensure that you're not ending up

742
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,039
with a

743
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,480
polluted environment so i'm going to

744
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,320
have my settings set to low

745
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,720
it sells me it's low so i'm fine with

746
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,559
that so i'm going to hit hack

747
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,840
and now what comes up is um a first name

748
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,640
and last name

749
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,320
like i mentioned you can you're going to

750
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,919
see all kinds of weird forms as you

751
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,320
continue down this path

752
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,080
so what we want to do is

753
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,320
here we want to enter our first name red

754
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,279
team and

755
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,320
and village and village

756
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,720
and then we're going to hit go and

757
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,000
basically all this

758
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,559
form does is reflect back the

759
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,080
information that we gave it

760
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,240
it says welcome red team village so it

761
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,200
took the first name

762
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,840
and the last name and put them together

763
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,559
so

764
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,880
pretty easy um one thing you can try is

765
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,760
you can try

766
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,039
i'm not going to go through this now but

767
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,360
you can try selecting this as low medium

768
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,120
and high and see what your results are

769
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,360
my suggestion is do every single lab

770
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,400
this way

771
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,440
select do the lab in low and then

772
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,840
reset the lab and then do it in medium

773
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
and then reset the lab and then do it in

774
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,200
high and see what your results are every

775
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,640
time you do this

776
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,520
so i'm basically showing you here a very

777
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,320
simple

778
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,799
um reflected get where the page is

779
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,400
reflecting back the information that we

780
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,360
put in

781
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,600
so i do mention a couple of observables

782
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,400
here

783
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,360
2.18 isn't observable you can just

784
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,120
follow along and take a look at this i

785
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,440
do

786
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,400
show a capture um from wireshark so you

787
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
can see what's actually going on

788
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,520
with um with the actual like

789
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,240
conversation between my workstation and

790
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
the uh website itself

791
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,840
so pretty pretty interesting but i

792
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,240
wanted to show you here that

793
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,559
we're calling this html i underscored

794
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,760
get.php

795
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,240
so we do know this is a php framework on

796
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,360
the back end

797
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
um if we if we were to right click on

798
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,559
the page we would see

799
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,320
um this reflect we would see how uh hdmi

800
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,120
dot get php is being used and the method

801
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,760
is get

802
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
so which is obvious because that's what

803
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,120
we selected in

804
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,279
in the method that we are using you're

805
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,720
welcome to set up a

806
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
wireshark sniffer and go through every

807
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,039
one of the exercises that way

808
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,440
more than likely you're well positively

809
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
you're going to see

810
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,360
each one of the php files and and

811
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,240
whether it's a get

812
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,520
or or put so now you can see the html

813
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,159
fields

814
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,640
um and the format um that you can enter

815
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,919
in the command line

816
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,120
um so you should have a better

817
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,960
understanding of how this uh

818
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,600
form works right so i mean it's it's

819
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,640
pretty clear

820
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,080
here that um then that the html code

821
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,760
html code showed us

822
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,399
we're accept expecting uh first name and

823
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,120
last name

824
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,760
and then um we use this method to call

825
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,679
it and then we actually put in

826
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,159
um first name first name and then last

827
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,840
name last name here i

828
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,679
actually in this thing here i actually

829
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,799
just did first name and last name so

830
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,679
um in the form um so now let's uh

831
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,799
reselect everything

832
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,600
i'm gonna go back um to here and i'm

833
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,840
gonna

834
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,080
um i'm going to go back and

835
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,600
sorry about that um you can log out and

836
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,360
log back in if you want to but i'm

837
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,039
i'm not going to do that i'm going to

838
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,760
just select a new bug

839
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,799
i'm actually going to reselect this one

840
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,640
i'm going to leave it on low and then

841
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,000
i'm going to hit hack and it's going to

842
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
bring me the form back up cleared

843
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,679
as you can see no more red team village

844
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,080
down here on the bottom

845
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,600
pretty simple and now i'm going to try

846
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,080
this

847
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,919
uh cool one this is a little bit more

848
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,360
complex than the

849
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,760
than the typical first starting ones but

850
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,679
all i'm going to do is copy this

851
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,880
from the guide and put it in here

852
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,279
yikes

853
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,960
and for some reason it's not cupping

854
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,360
between my guide and the machine

855
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,880
but it's pretty easy i can just

856
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,760
use the lab guide and and type it in

857
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,399
like

858
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,520
i have it here so i'm going to do for a

859
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,960
first name i think i'm just going to do

860
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,000
a red

861
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,960
team and then on the bottom part i'll go

862
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
ahead and put the

863
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,960
injected code i'm going to use a marquee

864
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,480
which if you know what a marquee is it's

865
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,279
basically a scrolling

866
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,840
banner and then i'm going to put hacked

867
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
by

868
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,799
red team and with any html code you

869
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,240
close the html code

870
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,799
out with a forward slash

871
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
and then you close it with the bracket

872
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,279
then we hit enter and now

873
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,320
guess what we see we see welcome

874
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,360
which was is built into the form and

875
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
red team which i put in first name and

876
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,039
the marquee part which is scrolling on

877
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,559
the bottom part which is

878
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,960
saying hacked by red team so this isn't

879
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,480
a this isn't a

880
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,960
uh a real hack uh it's more of just

881
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,880
basically messing around with the form

882
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,919
to get it to do that um and we

883
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,159
we can do something similar to that um

884
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,120
trying it with

885
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,039
medium and high and see where we get

886
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,200
so you'll so here i show basically the

887
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
same thing

888
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,039
setting it the setting there was low so

889
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,559
you can try setting it in

890
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,200
in medium and seeing what you get i'm

891
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,600
currently our setting is set to low

892
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,520
so let's try the same thing with medium

893
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
so i'm going to go ahead and do that

894
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,000
probably should have captured that

895
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,720
thing so

896
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,000
captured the text i put in but i'm going

897
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
to do medium i'm going to do

898
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,360
set then i'm going to go ahead and

899
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,960
select get

900
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,240
reflect to get and then tell it hack now

901
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,039
it is set to it is set to medium it

902
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,080
tells me

903
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,480
in the security level right here set to

904
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,720
medium

905
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,799
and there i entered a red team and

906
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,679
hacked by red team with the marquee

907
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,559
i'm set to medium it says right here i'm

908
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,320
going to hit go

909
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,200
and now what happened was the form

910
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,919
because of the

911
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,519
medium level security that is

912
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,360
implemented on this form

913
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,840
it it it said okay you can't do it that

914
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,720
simple

915
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,159
um overflow that simple um injection

916
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,559
i'm gonna validate that that is correct

917
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,600
um i'm gonna

918
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,000
i'm gonna display it any way i can so it

919
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,440
basically did

920
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,960
um it did take the marquee and displayed

921
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,440
it that way

922
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,519
so um so now a way to bypass it one way

923
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,840
to bypass that security measure is doing

924
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,120
url and coding

925
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,120
um so we're in our on our web page

926
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,360
i have it built in so you can either go

927
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,840
to this you can either go to

928
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,880
this website if you have the internet

929
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,039
um you can go to it and enter the code

930
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,760
here and it'll give you the output code

931
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,279
i built this lab so it can be done

932
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,279
offline so if you're like on an airplane

933
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,960
or whatever wherever you can

934
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,679
you can basically run this so on on your

935
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,480
main

936
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,840
page just hit f9 and it'll bring up this

937
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,360
quantum hack bar

938
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,919
uh which is awesome it allows you to

939
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,120
basically do

940
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,159
uh encoding and decoding um there

941
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,679
so we basically are going to do a a ural

942
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,039
and code

943
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,279
so we're going to take um what we are

944
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,480
typing in with the

945
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
marquee and we're going to paste it in

946
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
and then and then we're going to

947
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,720
have it encode it for us so i'm going to

948
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,360
select your own code

949
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,039
um the screen string i'm going to give

950
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,440
it is the marquee screen that we were

951
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,159
doing earlier

952
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,799
we're going to do marquee and start like

953
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,720
that

954
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,399
let me move this a little to the side

955
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
hopefully you can see my screen okay and

956
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,360
then i'm going to do

957
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,840
hacked by

958
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,640
red team and then i'm going to close out

959
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,440
the marquee

960
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,679
like so and then

961
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,960
i'm going to hit enter

962
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,279
and now what we have here in the middle

963
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,320
is

964
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,760
the url encoded information

965
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,919
a lot of it you can see is still plain

966
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,760
text but i think the tag

967
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,799
well the tags here are um

968
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,559
are what are what changed so i'm going

969
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,159
to copy that i'm going to

970
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,159
paste it in here oh actually i'm going

971
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,240
to reset my form

972
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,679
uh back to medium set i'm going to go

973
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,799
ahead and do get

974
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,399
i'm going to do it hack it's going to

975
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,919
give me a brand new form

976
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,200
i'm going to go ahead and paste that

977
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
here

978
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,559
and i'm going to paste it here as well

979
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,840
and then i'm going to do go and now look

980
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,559
we ended up bypassing the checks and the

981
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,120
medium

982
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,159
level security that are in in b

983
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,679
web and we end up with our scrolling

984
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,280
um marquee there so um

985
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,719
before i go i'm gonna tell you um

986
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,280
a couple things um you can download this

987
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,199
guide directly into the vm

988
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,119
and use the guide direct in the vm so

989
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,879
you can cut and paste between

990
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,839
the lab guide and the um and the and b

991
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839
um but one thing i will let you know is

992
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,159
that

993
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,839
in some cases when you do a copy and

994
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,320
paste

995
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,240
some of the letters are not properly

996
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,520
interpreted properly so what you're

997
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,879
going to end up having to do

998
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,359
is manually type in the entire command

999
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,079
so if you

1000
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,639
end up running something and and it

1001
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,639
gives you some weird results

1002
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,640
clear the form again like i showed you

1003
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
completely clear it

1004
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,920
by setting your security level and then

1005
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,480
selecting the the method the bug that

1006
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,760
you're going to test and then hitting

1007
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,480
hack

1008
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,680
it should tell you right here your

1009
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,920
current level and and now the form is

1010
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,960
clean

1011
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,520
um so you want to make sure that's done

1012
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,800
every time you do an exercise

1013
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,320
but if you end up with some weird

1014
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,640
results and the string is like

1015
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,520
pretty weird um try manually entering in

1016
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,599
the semicolons or the

1017
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,160
colons or the brackets or whatever

1018
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,200
because it's possible that your

1019
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,920
right click and what's in the in the lab

1020
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,720
guide

1021
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,040
um is not being interpreted properly so

1022
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,000
you might see that

1023
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,400
uh going forward so i just want to make

1024
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,040
sure that

1025
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,800
you understand that as you go forward so

1026
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,119
now start on the next one with reflected

1027
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,480
get and

1028
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,040
see what results you have this is a

1029
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,800
basic redirect this one's going to show

1030
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,359
you

1031
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,359
how easy it is to redirect somebody to

1032
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,480
another website

1033
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,320
you've probably browsed to some place

1034
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,000
and then all of a sudden you started

1035
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,599
getting all these weird pop-ups and

1036
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,960
being browsed other

1037
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,400
being pushed to other places that you

1038
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,240
had no intention of going a lot of that

1039
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,960
is done

1040
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,680
with this method right here doing an h

1041
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,400
ref and

1042
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,240
and injecting it into the site and if

1043
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,800
you if you end up getting into a blog or

1044
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,240
something like that and you paste this

1045
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,200
into a blog

1046
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,520
and someone opens up the blog and clicks

1047
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,040
on your post

1048
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,359
you can actually if the blog is

1049
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,800
vulnerable you can actually have the

1050
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,359
blog

1051
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,040
automatically redirect the person to it

1052
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,720
and we actually will go through that

1053
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,839
later

1054
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,200
here in the guide so anyway thank you

1055
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,400
for watching um continue working on the

1056
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,079
lab guide if you run into any

1057
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,040
problems uh let the people uh let all of

1058
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,880

1059
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,960
