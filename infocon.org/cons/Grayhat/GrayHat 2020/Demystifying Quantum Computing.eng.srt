[Music]

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,040
okay

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,320
hi all you all thank you for

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
watching this presentation thank you

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,440
in first place to great hat people

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,520
for inviting us to give this

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,640
presentation about

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,320
quantum computing at first

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
we will talk a little about us

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,439
my name is carlos fernitz i'm from

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,640
argentina

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
i'm a cyber security researcher for

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,559
many many years and i am a quantum

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,079
computing enthusiast

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,760
that's the reason i'm giving this

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,559
presentation and my colleague is

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
i'm luciano i'm also from argentina i'm

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,399
living in new york city

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,120
and i used to work a lot in infosec and

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,199
now i'm doing quantum computing at ibm

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,280
research

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
okay after the presentation

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,960
of the presentation the object

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
of this session is to give you some

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,320
examples some some information about

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,880
what

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
is quantum computing what

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,400
you can do and what you cannot do with

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
this

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
and our thoughts about the

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
the the things are how

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,680
things are going what the quantum

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
computing of first of all what is

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
quantum computing

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,079
okay this is a very simple

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,280
definition of what we think this

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
this is a kind of computational pattern

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,240
that uses quantum properties

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,720
of matter to solve mathematical

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
calculations okay

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
this is just a simple

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
definition but

43
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,880
the the thing we need to explain you is

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,840
what's the difference between classical

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
computing and quantum computing

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,080
in classical computing at first we we

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,480
want to tell you what we are not talking

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
in this presentation

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,959
we are we will not talk about uh quantum

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,400
mechanics

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,800
we will not talk about quantum physics

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
the basis of quantum computing is uh

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
really quantum mechanics and is also

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,239
quantum physics but we will

55
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,200
will not talk about this this is not

56
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,840
this is

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,599
this presentation is not about quantum

58
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,480
cryptography this is another field

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,760
it's similar but it's not the same and

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,519
it is not also not about

61
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,080
post quantum cryptography okay

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,040
okay as i told you at first we will not

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,360
talk

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,720
about uh physics uh because

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,000
it's very hard to understand uh

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,040
to because it's it's it's completely

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
not intuitive to understand quantum

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
mechanics

69
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,879
the same richard feynman years ago used

70
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,000
to say that if you

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,239
think you understand quantum mechanicals

72
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,920
it is because you don't really

73
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,800
understand it

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,680
we don't pretend to understand it we i

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,159
also

76
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,440
are trying to explain you some of the

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,239
properties of

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,519
quantum particles and how to use them

79
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,120
to do computing that's all what we are

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,599
doing

81
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,040
trying to explain you okay

82
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,159
okay at first we will uh

83
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,040
talk a little about qubits and the

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
properties cubits

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,159
are uh the extension

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,959
of bits we will in in classical

87
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
computing we have a bit as

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,720
uh the the elemental unit okay

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
we have a bit that can be one or

90
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,799
zero it can be resembled to

91
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,000
a switch that can be on or off

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
when the switch is on the room is

93
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,519
lightened when the switch is off the

94
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,959
room is dark

95
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,280
and this is all you can do with the

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,000
switch

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
just to be with in two positions or on

98
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,880
off uh in classical computers it's

99
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,520
a a few things that you can do with

100
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,479
these so

101
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,000
the the what people used to do

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
is to put a lot of beats in what we

103
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,400
call a bite in order to

104
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
represent the problems in in another way

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,280
in a more extensive way in order to to

106
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,639
use this unit to make calculations okay

107
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,680
but in quantum computing

108
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,880
the elemental unit is not a bit

109
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,240
is a qubit a cubit has

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
some other properties cubit is

111
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,199
rather different rather

112
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,320
extended rather confusing in a qubit you

113
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,800
have

114
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
a room that is not exactly a room that

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
have different orientations that the

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,039
light might

117
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,039
be on or off at the same time this is a

118
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,600
long

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
discussion but we can say that they it

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,880
can be

121
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,520
in the same time or on off it has a lot

122
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,080
of

123
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,120
states between the on and off the the

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,320
one and the zero

125
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,199
that the qubit is is really different

126
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,759
than the

127
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,039
the bit okay and one of the properties

128
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:37,600
that

129
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,639
cubit has also is that you can have two

130
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,520
qubits

131
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
that they say that that are entangled

132
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,919
that they can be very very

133
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,360
far apart one from the other and

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,039
the sequence of lightings and darkness

135
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,840
inside

136
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,120
these skewed for for to use this this

137
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
image is exactly the same in both

138
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,919
uh nevertheless they are they are

139
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,880
very far one from the other okay these

140
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,759
are part these are

141
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
parts of the of the properties of the

142
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,240
cube that

143
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,759
allows us to do computation

144
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,280
in more powerful way than

145
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,319
with simple bits okay

146
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,120
here you can have a another simpler

147
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,400
presentation a bit

148
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
just be just can be one or zero

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,400
there are no other possibilities but the

150
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
cubit

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,360
must have a state that can be between

152
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,479
a 1 and 0

153
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,919
but it can have theoretically infinite

154
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,039
states between

155
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,800
both okay the qubit is uh

156
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,160
usually represented as this

157
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,599
block sphere uh

158
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,720
this is a vector this is represented as

159
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,759
a vector that

160
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,639
is centered in the center of the sphere

161
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,759
and

162
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,490
the length of the vector is one and

163
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,759
[Music]

164
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,000
the state of the the qubit can be

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,440
anyone in in in the

166
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,240
in the surface of this sphere there you

167
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,639
have

168
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,080
two states zero at the top and one and

169
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,479
the

170
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,360
and the bottom but the

171
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
the qubit can have a lot of uh

172
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,400
states between them okay

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
these are the cube has three

174
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,599
main properties that we are using

175
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,479
to make this calculation one of them is

176
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,919
the superposition

177
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
this preposition means that the qubit

178
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
can be

179
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,919
as i told you it's there is a long

180
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,680
discussion about that but

181
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
we can say that the queue it can have

182
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
the two

183
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,879
states at the same time this is the

184
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,720
famous schredinger's cut

185
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,960
that can be uh until you open the bag

186
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,080
it can can be alive and dead at the same

187
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,879
time

188
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,199
okay we will not enter this discussion

189
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,120
but the concept is that

190
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,240
uh you can have both states

191
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,759
in a superposition okay the other

192
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,720
property of the

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,720
cubit is the entanglement as i told you

194
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,839
when i showed you the the two rooms uh

195
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
very very far one from the other uh when

196
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,080
you entangle

197
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,760
to cue it the two are not independent

198
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,640
uh the two are connected and the

199
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,560
both qubits can act uh

200
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,680
randomly but this randomness is exactly

201
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,720
the same in

202
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,040
both of them okay they are connected if

203
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,080
you

204
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,680
read one of the queue with the state of

205
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,360
one and the queue it's the other queue

206
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,160
it has

207
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
exactly the same state at the same time

208
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
okay and the third property

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
is a property that is not good it's uh

210
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
is a property that we want to get rid of

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,720
it

212
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
but we cannot uh very easily

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
which is the coherence the coherence the

214
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,000
coherence means that

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,200
it's a kind of noise when you put a

216
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
cubit in

217
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,839
a state and they kill it the state of

218
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
this cubit

219
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
tend to go back to the original instead

220
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,240
normally ground state or zero and

221
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,480
the state that you set to discover

222
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,080
stay for a very very short time

223
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,959
rather some microseconds so you have to

224
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,839
use this information this queue it in

225
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,040
between this window

226
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,839
or some microseconds in order to be

227
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,399
useful

228
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,760
okay okay with this property we can do

229
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,320
calculations we which are the

230
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,160
calculation that we can do with qubits

231
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,959
okay

232
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,320
mainly rotations these are six example

233
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,040
of six

234
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,600
uh rotation that you can do do with a

235
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,839
cubit

236
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,680
uh as i told you the qubit is

237
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,200
represented as a vector with

238
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
center in the center of the uh with

239
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,760
origin in the center of the sphere

240
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,160
and the end in the surface of the sphere

241
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,120
so

242
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,880
uh pulling the this vector in different

243
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,519
positions inside the field means

244
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,160
rotation

245
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,560
and that means that are the the

246
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
calculation that you can do

247
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,279
do with a qubit okay

248
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,959
um the different operations

249
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,079
or or calculations that you can do

250
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,440
do with a single qubit are

251
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
um are done in

252
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,000
in quantum computers with gates mainly

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
with gates and this

254
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,839
i want luciano to assist me in this he

255
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,480
is an

256
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,000
expert in in quantum computing at ibm

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,399
and

258
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,959
he uses these gates every day so

259
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,680
please do you know tell us about these

260
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,399
gates

261
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,680
please gates quantum gates are analogous

262
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,000
to classical gates like for example

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,519
xor and or not

264
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,959
and as classical gates they may have

265
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,680
multiple

266
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,920
inputs for example in classical gates

267
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,640
the note gate has one bit input and one

268
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
bit output

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
so similar here you have you can have

270
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
some plates that are operating two

271
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,079
cubits or

272
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,120
one qubit or three or more qubits

273
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,320
the the the most important one probably

274
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,440
is an h the harder market is the one

275
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
that you show in the

276
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,519
in the previous slide it's a it's a half

277
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,240
rotation

278
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,639
that puts the the qubit in superposition

279
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,040
it starts in the ground state

280
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
if you applied a hara market to a

281
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,079
superposition state

282
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,600
you will get back to the ground state

283
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
for example so

284
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
we said that that gate is self-inverse

285
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
if you play it twice

286
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,560
it's like a blind none some other gates

287
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,480
are not solving verbs for example

288
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,040
the s gate is a rotation that you need

289
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,760
to apply

290
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,079
s stagger in order to go back to the

291
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,680
same place so the inverse of s

292
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,880
is s dagger same applies to chi

293
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
the the the one with the circle with the

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,480
cross in the middle

295
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,279
is not it's basically also a single

296
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:35,760
cubit

297
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,839
sometimes it's called an x-gate and

298
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,040
basically negates

299
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,399
it's it's a 180 degrees that negates a

300
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,600
serum into a one

301
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,160
or basically makes that location so

302
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,800
whatever

303
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
whatever is your initial position you

304
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,240
will have that position on the other

305
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,519
direction

306
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,600
and there are other multiple rotations

307
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,040
there are arbitrary rotations that you

308
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,600
can do

309
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,000
on the different axis x y sets um

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,839
the the the full surface of the sphere

311
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
is fair game so you can point wherever

312
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,959
in that

313
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,160
in that quantum point sphere there are

314
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,040
some

315
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
of the of this uh that you have here at

316
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,240
the stream they are not

317
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,200
gates per se we call them instructions

318
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
they don't have this

319
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,240
characteristic of being reversible for

320
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
example those in gray

321
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,120
are instructions so for example it's

322
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
possible to do a reset

323
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,399
of a gate which is basically the second

324
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,920
one which has a zero

325
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,639
inside that one is a it's a reset

326
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,320
instruction basically

327
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
in whatever state it was that would put

328
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,000
it back into the ground state into the

329
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,279
serious state

330
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,360
and another important instruction is

331
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,600
measurement which is the

332
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
the last one of the gray ones which is

333
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,800
basically

334
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,560
whatever is the state of this cubit

335
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,440
collapse it into zero one in order to

336
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,160
to measure that and the probabilities of

337
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
measure zero one

338
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
will depend on the position uh where

339
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,040
that qubit was

340
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,680
that the state in that group do you

341
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
think that that will make it charlie

342
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,800
yes of course thank you very much uh i i

343
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,360
wanted

344
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,639
the the expert to explain this okay

345
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,360
so when you have uh let's say one qubit

346
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,040
you can do much more things

347
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,639
that just putting on or off like a bit

348
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,000
and so how we solve

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,040
problem with problems with this okay

350
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,519
okay the way to of solving problems

351
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,639
can be explained here a

352
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,160
vector rotation inside a sphere can be

353
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,120
uh represented as as a matrix

354
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,000
multiplication

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,760
okay when you uh

356
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,360
rotate this this vector you can put the

357
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,920
positions of this vector into a matrix

358
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,120
then multiply and

359
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,440
the the result will be the vector

360
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,240
rotated

361
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,360
so will you the the the main

362
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,639
idea here is that you can use

363
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,320
the qubit as a matrix

364
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,760
multiplication so if you have a problem

365
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,800
that can be modeled as

366
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,639
a matrix multiplication you can go back

367
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,320
and erase and solve it into

368
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,160
a qubit or into a quantum computer with

369
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,959
a set of

370
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,800
qubits okay it's not too much what you

371
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
can do with just one qubit okay

372
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,880
so to do this to to

373
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,959
er let's say you have a problem and you

374
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,880
have you want to solve this problem

375
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,560
in inside the quantum computer

376
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,759
because as you know if you

377
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,759
have to solve a matrix multiplication in

378
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,480
a

379
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,920
classical computer you will it will take

380
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,880
a lot of time

381
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,399
a lot of calculation a lot of iterations

382
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,839
to do that

383
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,240
and you can do this just with a single

384
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,199
shot in a

385
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,120
quantum computer this is the power of

386
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,959
these kind of computers

387
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,199
okay so let's say you mentioned that

388
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,880
additionally there is a

389
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
thing with the space that the size of

390
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,000
the space i'm not sure if you're going

391
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,720
to make okay

392
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,839
of course please so so

393
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,519
check out this example this is haramar

394
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,120
gate that it

395
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,240
operates on a single qubit and the

396
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,720
and the and the matrix that that

397
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,519
represents

398
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,120
is a two by two if you have a two pivot

399
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,680
system

400
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,399
you can represent a two to the power of

401
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,440
two

402
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,639
square matrix so as you add more

403
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,120
uh more you double the space

404
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
in terms of the size of the matrix that

405
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,399
you can represent

406
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,360
so in a in a six cubic system you will

407
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
have two to the power six

408
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,320
uh by two to the power series matrix and

409
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,360
and

410
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,000
quickly that classically gets invisible

411
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
right to operate

412
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,680
with big matrices it's something that

413
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,359
classically is very hard to do and

414
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,959
quantum computers are particularly good

415
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,039
at doing yes of course

416
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,720
these are the two main powers or

417
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
superpowers of cubits

418
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,799
the the representation space that is

419
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,919
scales uh very very fast

420
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,480
uh compared with with bits with

421
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
classical computing and bits

422
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,880
and the power of the com the speed of

423
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
computation because

424
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,360
you can solve these huge matrices just

425
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,480
with one shot

426
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
so this is the reason uh

427
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,960
why uh so many companies and so many

428
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,679
left

429
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,080
in the in all the world are trying to

430
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
achieve their their best effort

431
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,400
to do their best quantum computers for

432
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,200
the because

433
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,000
the power is is really huge so let's say

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you have a problem are you and you want

435
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,400
to

436
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,440
solve it you have to solve mainly four

437
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
challenges

438
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,918
okay with this algorithm oh so

439
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,679
the problem you would have to solve okay

440
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,720
two plus one equals c where

441
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,440
in a classic computer we you you

442
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,799
normally convert the decimal numbers to

443
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,080
two binary numbers and you do

444
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
this here

445
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
you get the the results here this is one

446
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,400
of the

447
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,039
the the ways that you can solve this

448
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,520
okay

449
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,480
in computer computing you can do the

450
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,280
same

451
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
the difference between quantum computer

452
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,480
and

453
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,600
and classical computer is that you don't

454
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,480
have

455
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,400
exactly uh

456
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,480
okay

457
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,320
quantum gates and instructions like

458
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,440
this this reading instruction here okay

459
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,240
this is what

460
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,600
you you get when you finally

461
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,039
uh build a quantum algorithm

462
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,600
there okay so as i told you we have you

463
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,320
have to

464
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,720
solve mainly four challenges the first

465
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
challenge is the model

466
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,280
you have to model your problem as a

467
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,559
matrix uh multiplication if you cannot

468
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,679
model the

469
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,799
problem asymmetric quantification

470
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,559
it would be very difficult to

471
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,720
be solved in a quantum computer

472
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
better than in a classical computer okay

473
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,160
you can solve it because a

474
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
quantum computer is is turing complete

475
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,240
but you cannot

476
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,360
do it faster than in in a

477
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,440
classical computer this is the first

478
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,679
challenge the second challenge

479
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,360
is that your quantum circuit as i

480
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,720
showed you recently uh has er

481
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,240
has to fit in your hardware

482
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,159
it's in current

483
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,120
quantum computer hardware are rather

484
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,840
small

485
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,039
with several uh

486
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,640
at most hundreds or qubits are very very

487
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,840
very small in in

488
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,600
their size

489
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,960
so you have to be sure

490
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,520
that your problem can feed the the

491
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,640
quantum circle that

492
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,080
was the result of your problem can fit

493
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,240
in the computer the other one

494
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,760
is have to run

495
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,120
the the problem many times in a

496
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,600
quantum computer because the as i told

497
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,640
you

498
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,080
by the coherence or by noise you

499
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,760
can have

500
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,520
several times wrong results so you have

501
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,919
to run it many times in order to

502
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,520
statistically

503
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,440
say okay if if this result have been

504
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,320
at the out of the output of the computer

505
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,000
eighty percent of the time and this

506
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,960
result

507
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
twenty percent of the day okay i take

508
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,080
the eighty percent

509
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,960
as the recorded result okay this is a

510
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,000
strategy that you have

511
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,600
to to to to define okay

512
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,679
let me make a footnote there okay it

513
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,600
could be possible that your problem has

514
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,719
more than one solution

515
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,840
in a single execution will only give you

516
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,520
one of those solutions so

517
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,840
even if you run without noise sometimes

518
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,520
you have to write several times so you

519
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,200
can see that statistically

520
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,280
those solutions for example they have 50

521
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,559
percent of chances

522
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,240
or maybe a solution has more problems in

523
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,159
the other one but but you want to

524
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,240
the the result is this statistical

525
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,480
description of the possible solutions

526
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,240
even when some of them may be the wrong

527
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,039
solution because of counts as you said

528
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,640
okay great thanks that's true

529
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,080
and okay and the fourth challenge

530
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,280
is noise you have noise in many

531
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,080
sources one of the sources as i told you

532
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,400
is

533
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,360
the coherence you have this solution

534
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,520
will be present in the cube it's just

535
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,400
very very few microseconds you have to

536
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,120
do

537
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,919
something with that to to feed another

538
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:32,960
cubit or to

539
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,760
read the the solution before it it falls

540
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,320
to the

541
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,840
to the ground state and you have another

542
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
noise sources like for example

543
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,799
thermal noise you have thermal noise

544
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,280
that's i we will talk about this in in a

545
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,679
few

546
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,360
minutes okay let's say we have a problem

547
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,159
we have

548
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,159
made an algorithm that we with

549
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,760
that algorithm we have uh

550
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,320
the result is a quantum circuit with

551
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,080
that quantity we have to solve these

552
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,360
four challenges and

553
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,320
we will run this to solve the problem

554
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,799
where

555
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,679
we will run this in some kind of

556
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,039
hardware

557
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,320
while from the hardware you are used to

558
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,679
this is the hardware you you

559
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,880
know already know but quantum computers

560
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
are quite different

561
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,080
here we have some examples uh this is

562
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,919
with sycamore for example

563
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,159
this is the one of the machines from

564
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,360
righty that is a

565
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
company that that's only the

566
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,480
the purpose is to to work in computing

567
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,559
in quantum computing this is for example

568
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,320
the one quantum computer from microsoft

569
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
microsoft is working

570
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,000
a completely different technology than

571
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
the others

572
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,520
and for example the ibm

573
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,520
q53 this is one of the ibm's

574
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,720
quantum computer all these

575
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,880
pictures you are seeing are not exactly

576
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,760
the same that

577
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,880
you can see in the labs

578
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,039
they were touched by the by the artist

579
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,640
but i'll see like more or less like this

580
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,440
if you see if you look at the bottom of

581
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,080
this

582
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,400
of these computers you have a

583
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
cylinder there if you take off this

584
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
cylinder

585
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,559
you can see inside this small black

586
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,320
square this is the chip

587
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,600
this is the quantum chip okay uh

588
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,120
the quantum computer is is very

589
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,720
different from classical computer but

590
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,320
the chip now the chips are

591
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,440
very similar in in as

592
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,000
you can see this for example is a very

593
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,120
recent

594
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,880
achievement from ibm it's a quantum

595
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,440
chip for of 65 cubits

596
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,559
a couple of weeks ago

597
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,159
and how these

598
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,720
chips are works for example here you

599
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,520
have

600
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,720
a proof of concept from

601
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,000
10 years ago from ibm ii this is a

602
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,080
profile concept just from one cookie

603
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
cubit okay

604
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,240
and this

605
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320
processor quantum processor from five

606
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,440
qubits

607
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,679
if you see in the center of the of the

608
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,200
image you have you you see

609
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,240
four squares if sorry five squares these

610
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
five squares

611
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,640
are the five uh qubits in

612
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,840
the chip

613
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,320
as i told you there are several

614
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,360
technologies

615
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,559
to to do a qubit a qubit is

616
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,240
a physical representation

617
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,400
of a quantum state as you know say

618
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,440
uh you you can see a quantum set in a

619
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,799
quantum particle

620
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,919
but you cannot work

621
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,600
for your computation with quantum

622
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,080
particle you cannot

623
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,960
take a single form a single electron and

624
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,440
change

625
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,480
its state you have to do this

626
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,360
with a lot of a lot of different

627
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
techniques that

628
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,400
can behave like a quantum particle okay

629
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,240
the there are several

630
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,440
techniques one of them the the the

631
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,559
the most used i is the

632
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,600
super conducting technology a

633
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,799
superconductor is

634
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,760
material is a very strange material you

635
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,720
have

636
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,840
several a couple of hundreds of

637
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
materials that became

638
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,039
superconducting superconduct

639
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,158
means that you

640
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,120
can have a material that the resistance

641
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,799
is completely zero

642
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,240
okay but this occurs just below

643
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,440
some critical temperature and this

644
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,480
critical temperature

645
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,400
is really really low

646
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,840
one of the materials that is most common

647
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
uses is aluminum

648
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,440
and the aluminium is superconductor

649
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,640
below three two or three

650
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,320
uh cell kelvin degrees

651
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,600
as you know zero

652
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,200
kelvin degrees is the absolute zero you

653
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,159
cannot go

654
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,720
physically it's impossible to go below

655
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
zero

656
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,840
kelvin okay quantum computer chips

657
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,120
works about 15 milli kelvins

658
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,919
so that's the reason the strange shape

659
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,039
that you can see

660
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,080
in those photos recently because

661
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,120
all the that hardware that you see

662
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,320
the 99 percent of the hardware is just

663
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,360
to keep

664
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,480
the quantum chip this is the

665
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,760
the only reason to be below

666
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,960
uh one

667
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
degree kelvin

668
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,320
a full node for this is very

669
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
crazy because if you see in the outer

670
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,080
space

671
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,000
in in play very far from any object

672
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,559
you can measure two or three

673
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:34,240
kelvin degrees and if these chips are at

674
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,799
15 mil kelvins that means that

675
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,679
you're having these computers uh

676
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,520
temperatures below

677
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,960
the table even in the outer space okay

678
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,559
okay how a computer

679
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,159
quantum compute looks like this is more

680
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,559
realistic as you can it is this

681
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,600
container is just to to keep

682
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,880
this really cool inside

683
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,919
this is a picture about how different

684
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,200
companies are working and running to

685
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,520
to achieve their their quantum computers

686
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,120
some of them in all of them in different

687
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,640
directions really okay

688
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,000
uh we have recently discovered a new

689
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,720
technique a new company named sanado

690
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,039
that they claim that they have a

691
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,960
quantum chip that works at room

692
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,600
temperature this is really cool because

693
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,919
as i told you it's very very difficult

694
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,440
to achieve

695
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,200
so low temperatures they use

696
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,399
foreign as as

697
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,919
qubits this is a

698
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,880
really new achievement and you also have

699
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,200
besides all the the companies i show you

700
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
and the

701
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,559
quantum computer which i show you you

702
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,960
have them also

703
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,000
some people really in

704
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,039
the uh in the east

705
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,039
working on this here you have uh

706
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,320
chinese people working in

707
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,799
a channel microscope that is is very

708
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,080
important to

709
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,520
to build quantum chips

710
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,559
okay great

711
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,600
before going to the demonstration

712
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,039
i we want to tell you about some myths

713
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,320
and facts about

714
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,159
quantum computing we will tell the

715
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,279
what is it is said over there about

716
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,120
quantum computing and what is the the

717
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,200
truth about all of them

718
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,399
one of them what they are saying is that

719
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,480
one computers can run the same programs

720
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,360
that classical

721
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,720
ones more efficiently okay

722
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,399
okay no quantum computers can run only

723
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,960
certain algorithm more efficiently as i

724
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,559
told you some slides before

725
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,760
if you can model your problem as

726
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,880
a matrix multiplication maybe

727
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,279
you can run this problem in a quantum

728
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,240
computer

729
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,799
really really faster than in the

730
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,640
classical computer but

731
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,600
if you want to do other things uh that

732
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,320
are not

733
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,120
moderate like a matrix multiplication it

734
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,080
it would be

735
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,600
very hard to do that really in in a

736
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,640
quantum computer okay other means that

737
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,360
uh are over there you can see all this

738
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,200
in internet is that quad computers are

739
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,000
going to

740
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,360
outperform classical ones it's

741
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,360
rather similar to the other saying

742
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,480
yes but only in some specific tasks

743
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
okay there will be another task that

744
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,799
will

745
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,840
not be really do well by quantum

746
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,720
computers other

747
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,640
myth is that quantum computing means the

748
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,720
end of classical computing

749
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,159
okay really what

750
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,880
maybe will be the future is that

751
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,559
classical and quantum computers will

752
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,760
work together

753
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,080
in a kind of hybrid architecture

754
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,279
in the way that any of them will

755
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,399
solve problems uh of

756
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,640
their fields efficiently really

757
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,000
efficiently but

758
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,039
none of them will uh replace the other

759
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,320
okay one

760
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,919
of the really really

761
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,159
well

762
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
established admit is that quantum

763
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,039
computer will destroy cyber security

764
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,600
this

765
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,799
they are saying this because of

766
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,279
some algorithms that that can solve

767
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,399
a large number uh factorization

768
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,720
like sure algolim er luciano will show

769
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,240
us this

770
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,159
uh but no really no because uh

771
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,159
quantum computers are just part of uh

772
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:10,880
security

773
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,080
cyber security is formed with by uh

774
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,480
many other concepts like for example

775
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,960
have your servers properly configured

776
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,360
have your application properly

777
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,000
built and there are a lot of other

778
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,720
things that are not cryptography

779
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,480
one and in one side and in the other

780
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,159
side you need about

781
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,080
a hundred thousand cubits to break

782
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,519
a key to

783
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,000
2000 key bits key in seconds okay

784
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,600
so not really and the other thing that

785
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,399
people are saying about not only quantum

786
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,360
computing but

787
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,360
quantum mechanics itself

788
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,080
is something like this that quantum

789
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,880
computers

790
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,120
that are very related to machine

791
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,960
learning machine learning is one of the

792
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,240
problems that

793
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,000
people want to solve with quantum

794
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
computer and they they are very good

795
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,119
doing this

796
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,839
uh okay if you can put machine learning

797
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,639
in

798
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,239
in a quantum computer the quantum

799
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,040
computer is enough

800
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,480
big this computer will be become

801
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,760
conscious

802
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,280
okay and this is one of this is what we

803
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,960
think about that

804
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,719
uh it's really

805
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,000
a very very long distance between a

806
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,359
very good machine learning computer and

807
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,918
that that machine can be became

808
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,359
conscious okay

809
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,639
okay i'm finished by now

810
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,320
and let's go to some demos that

811
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,760
luciano will bring us

812
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,079
here let me show the screen okay

813
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,839
that's it

814
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,920
perfect awesome

815
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,400
so let's let's start with it with uh

816
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,599
some hands on

817
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,440
on the on the framework that i'm most

818
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,359
familiar with that is cascade

819
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,359
there are many frameworks out there for

820
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,040
playing with quantum computing that

821
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,240
this one is rather popular and before

822
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,359
that

823
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,359
let's talk a bit more about this notion

824
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,040
of a quantum gate

825
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,200
and this analogy to classical games

826
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,040
right here in the top of the screen you

827
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
have a

828
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,960
classical xor that takes two bits as

829
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,440
input

830
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,800
and computes the exclusive org and

831
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,079
gives you one bit output

832
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,640
similar to this guide you can have also

833
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,520
quantum gates as

834
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,560
charlotte explained and um and

835
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,320
a very common one is this one called

836
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,240
synod which is usually used for

837
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,440
entanglements

838
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,720
and in in a rough sense and just

839
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,119
like for familiarity it works a bit like

840
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,400
an a conditioner like an

841
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,320
if so if um if the wire on top

842
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,920
the x wire is a one

843
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,440
it will apply a synod gate to the bottom

844
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
wire to the y

845
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,320
and in this way you can compute

846
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
similarly like the xor

847
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,119
operation that we have classically the

848
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,480
interesting situation is what

849
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,040
happens when x is not in a classical

850
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,720
stage zero one but in superposition

851
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,520
states

852
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,440
but but but for now we can we can

853
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,040
simplify it like that right

854
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,359
and also notice that we talked about

855
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,640
that that

856
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,079
the gates the quantum gates are

857
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,000
reversible that means

858
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,760
that with the output you can reconstruct

859
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,040
the input

860
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,480
and that's not something that happens

861
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,560
per se in classical

862
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,160
case right so for example in the x or

863
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,320
from the top you you don't

864
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,160
you see that with the output you cannot

865
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,680
reconstruct the input

866
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,839
so in order to to to add that property

867
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,359
to a classical gauge we have to add this

868
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,320
extra wire

869
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,119
that you can see in the right hand side

870
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,160
so we

871
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,520
with this information with this

872
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,680
introduction let's let's let's jump into

873
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,960
the into the game so

874
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,240
the first thing that we have to do is to

875
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,320
import some um

876
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,240
some biscuit uh utilities

877
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,960
and then let's jump a bit with with the

878
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,400
with some of the properties that gate

879
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,760
has let's take for example the hara

880
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,119
market

881
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,400
this haram market is the one that is

882
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
super positioned right and as charlie

883
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,800
said

884
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,079
they can be represented as as cubits uh

885
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,480
sorry as mattresses right this mattress

886
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
is what it's called normalize

887
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,560
it doesn't really matter what that means

888
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,920
but something that would like to to

889
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,000
focus on is the fact that

890
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,160
that the the the size is two by two

891
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,000
because it's a one cubit

892
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,119
uh gate right uh if we if we

893
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,240
if we do the same with the other other

894
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,839
um gates for example the c nut cage

895
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,839
the cx-8 the c.n.net is the one that we

896
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,079
have here at the top

897
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,000
and that operates in two qubits and

898
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,160
therefore is four by four

899
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,280
and you can also do a cc x

900
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,680
like it's basically like a this one but

901
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,880
with two control

902
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,520
wires so operating three qubits and

903
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,880
therefore the matrix that

904
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,000
that that represent is eight by eight so

905
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,200
you can see here

906
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,040
what what i mean before with the with

907
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,119
this representation space

908
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,480
that you can get with you it's another

909
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,800
important thing to mention is that

910
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,920
the these matrices they operate

911
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,800
in the complex space right it's not it's

912
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,560
not in the in the

913
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,920
they're not natural numbers so they are

914
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,920
not integers they are complex numbers

915
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,880
so let's start first with with a with a

916
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,680
classical

917
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,800
um classical circuit let's call it ball

918
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,920
state

919
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,119
and uh it's it's a it's a very common

920
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,240
first step it's called the

921
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,079
hello world of the quantum computing

922
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,680
right and

923
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,280
you can when when you when we know that

924
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,680
h

925
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,079
and c naught are two matrices so we can

926
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,599
compute the multiplication of those

927
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,680
matrices and we're going to have this as

928
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,200
a result

929
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,560
again it's a it's a it's a

930
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,119
it's a four by four because it's a two

931
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,119
cubic system

932
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,000
and another thing that we can do is to

933
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
to measure it

934
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,079
right so let's let's have the same

935
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,079
circuit and now we can if we can measure

936
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,520
what's going on there

937
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,240
half of the time so we can run this 1000

938
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,800
times

939
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,200
to have statistical results right and

940
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,040
half of the times the result was zero

941
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,960
zero and half which either side was

942
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,200
one one and um why is that well because

943
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,040
this is a sleeping this gives you fifty

944
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,720
percent chances of being in one position

945
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,680
or the other one

946
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,000
and then the c note gage applies the not

947
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
gate both of the time zones are going

948
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,280
down not

949
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,119
so therefore you can see the the

950
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,640
dependency between those

951
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,760
two qubits in what is called

952
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,480
entitlement

953
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,000
so let's let's now go into our

954
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,359
first algorithm because things

955
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,319
are it's hard to see how these kind of

956
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,000
things can be useful right so

957
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,680
let's jump into something called

958
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
algorithm which

959
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,160
main focus is to show where is the

960
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,960
advantage

961
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,040
of quantum computations or classical

962
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,079
accommodations

963
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,079
it's a bit of a made-up problem so

964
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,160
verbally

965
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,800
the only corporate system illustrates

966
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,440
the point of communication more powerful

967
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,440
so so take a chicken function

968
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,640
that has a one

969
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,680
sorry to take a fashion that it has a as

970
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,240
input

971
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,839
one bit and as output one bit

972
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,839
uh there are only four kind of functions

973
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,440
that have that property that takes

974
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,640
one bit and return one bit uh

975
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,000
half of them we are going to call them

976
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,520
balance and half of them we are going to

977
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,200
call them constant

978
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,960
if if if a function

979
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,280
if the output is independent of the of

980
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,240
the input

981
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,440
in that case we're going to call it

982
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,560
constant and if the output is dependent

983
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,920
of the input in that case we are going

984
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,319
to call it balanced

985
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,240
uh there are only four of these factors

986
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,160
by construction so we know we know that

987
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,200
that's good

988
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,040
and also we are only trigger theories

989
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,400
balance or constant there are no

990
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,440
third option so

991
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,359
let's now put one of these functions

992
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,440
inside a box uh that box we're going to

993
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,000
call it an

994
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,280
oracle so we can ask questions to darker

995
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,599
and we can see the answer from oracle

996
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,560
but we cannot

997
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,520
we don't know how is the oracle built

998
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,760
so the the problem that torch tries to

999
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,280
solve is the following

1000
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,800
if i don't know which is in the function

1001
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,119
in the oracle

1002
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,319
how do i know if the function directly

1003
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,520
is balanced or constant so classically

1004
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,160
in order to

1005
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,520
answer the question i need to run a

1006
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
execution twice i have to ask two

1007
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,960
questions to the record

1008
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,200
i have to say okay give me the answer

1009
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,480
for the inputs here

1010
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,040
give me the answer for the input one if

1011
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,920
both answers

1012
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,160
are the same therefore the the result is

1013
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,440
constant subject

1014
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,280
if they are not it get that case is

1015
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,480
balanced

1016
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,560
so that that's that's the classical

1017
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,240
answer the answer to true dodge

1018
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,359
algorithm

1019
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,200
the quantum answer to the algorithm can

1020
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
be done only with one question with one

1021
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,640
execution

1022
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,720
and and for that we we need to build

1023
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
this quantum oracle

1024
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,440
and we know that gates are reversible

1025
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,480
that's why we had to add

1026
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,160
extra wires here in the quantum version

1027
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,680
of the vehicle but basically

1028
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,520
basically you stay with me that that's a

1029
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,119
that's a the oracle

1030
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,480
classically in quantum is the same but

1031
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,839
the the things that we're going to bring

1032
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,640
around it are the the differs

1033
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,160
so in order to see how this works

1034
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,240
let's start by first construct these

1035
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,520
four conditions

1036
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,160
into a quantum machine as charlie also

1037
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,119
mentioned

1038
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,520
these functions are classical functions

1039
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,280
but we can represent classical functions

1040
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,359
in a quantum computer two right

1041
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,720
so the first one that we're going to

1042
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,640
represent is the constant zero it's the

1043
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,760
simplest one right

1044
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,079
doesn't matter the input the output is

1045
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,920
always zero

1046
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,040
so basically it's the empty circle

1047
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,000
uh the the the the the initial state of

1048
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,040
of cubics

1049
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,599
is the ground state zero and and i will

1050
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,920
not change that chronos

1051
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,599
of the input then the the the constant

1052
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,960
one i i will ignore the inputs and i

1053
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,920
will always

1054
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,200
have one at the output because it's not

1055
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,920
i can apply an update and that will turn

1056
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,119
the zero

1057
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,839
into one in the output wire

1058
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,680
the identity one is a bit more

1059
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,599
complicated but we already know how to

1060
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,280
solve it right because we already know

1061
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,720
c not work if the output is one

1062
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,880
in that case i will apply a not gate in

1063
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,880
the uh sorry if they input this one in

1064
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,480
that case i will apply the node page

1065
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,000
in the output and if the input is zero

1066
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,359
in that case the the the that block gate

1067
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,720
will not exist in the process

1068
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,800
and therefore the output will be zero is

1069
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,000
the identity

1070
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,480
input one output one input zero output

1071
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,800
zero

1072
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,839
and the last one is invert it's

1073
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,400
basically like identity but at the end i

1074
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,119
do the inverse i flip the output

1075
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,839
so let's let's now make it test to see

1076
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,040
if those

1077
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,400
things work as as they're supposed to

1078
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,359
work

1079
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,680
so let's create one circuit they're the

1080
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,800
things between the bars

1081
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,599
we call it barriers those those things

1082
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,599
are the the function itself

1083
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,000
and the thing in the dx that i put out

1084
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,280
is the input right so for example the

1085
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,560
input that i choose here is

1086
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,079
one the input is one and and now i

1087
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,240
applying the invert um

1088
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,520
function here and if i execute this

1089
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,800
uh what if activity is always the same

1090
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,760
result right because

1091
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,160
there is no and the deterministic this

1092
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,839
is a classical computation in a quantum

1093
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,359
shaped basic classical competition

1094
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,640
therefore it's deterministic and

1095
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
therefore one house of one

1096
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,359
uh al i always get the same results here

1097
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,640
because the input is one

1098
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,119
i applied indoors and then the output is

1099
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,480
zero

1100
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,960
so if i if i instead of doing invert i

1101
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
do an entity

1102
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,200
the circuit is slightly different and

1103
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,240
always the output

1104
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,319
is one if the input is one the output is

1105
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,440
always one

1106
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,800
okay so uh

1107
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,720
now with a bit more confidence that our

1108
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,960
functions work are they supposed to work

1109
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,359
let's go into the into the deutsche

1110
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,160
algorithm

1111
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,720
itself so consider this situation

1112
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,119
and now i have this this function inside

1113
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,160
the box that i call

1114
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,880
oracle i have the article of four that i

1115
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,319
already forgot

1116
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,000
which oracle is that one and say

1117
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,599
and and the things that we put around it

1118
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,200
is the algorithm itself this how to

1119
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,560
market these things around it it's the

1120
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,520
algorithm itself

1121
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
we're not going to include this here

1122
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,119
what's what they do

1123
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,720
uh but um but if you're going back to do

1124
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,359
the math and to see how how this works

1125
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,720
but for reasons of times we're just

1126
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,560
going to run it just to

1127
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,119
just to try to make the bond here so

1128
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,000
let's

1129
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,040
let's see if the result is one that

1130
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,079
means that the output

1131
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,119
is balanced if the result is zero that

1132
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,079
means that the output

1133
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,560
sorry that the function is constant yes

1134
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,640
this is the way that it works

1135
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,319
i make this small translation so you

1136
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,319
don't have to remember that difference

1137
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,400
and for example the oracle 4 says here

1138
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,359
that

1139
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,640
the it's balanced

1140
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,280
so it tells us that the oracle 4 that is

1141
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,000
right here is

1142
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,720
balanced right and i i only did it in

1143
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,480
only one execution in one shot if i do

1144
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,000
it several times i will get always the

1145
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,119
same result

1146
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,680
but but the but the important part here

1147
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,720
is that you can do it

1148
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,560
with one execution right so that's why

1149
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,359
as promised i will only use one shot

1150
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,040
and um and let's see let's see if the

1151
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,119
oracle 4 is indeed

1152
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,240
balanced here the the function invert it

1153
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,180
is fine

1154
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,440
[Music]

1155
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,839
for the sake of bit

1156
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,359
and the oracle 2 tells a torch tells me

1157
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,560
that it's constant

1158
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,599
so let's check it out if the record 2

1159
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,000
is the constant 1 function it's always 1

1160
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,520
differently of the input

1161
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,640
so the authority is getting always there

1162
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,000
the the right answer right so hopefully

1163
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,400
this

1164
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,880
is an invitation if not convincing at

1165
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,880
least an invitation to so you can go

1166
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,480
deeper into what's going on here

1167
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,640
but but but first to illustrate that

1168
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,720
only with one execution it is possible

1169
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,599
to answer a

1170
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,000
question that in classically we require

1171
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,240
two executions

1172
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,800
let's let's now jump on the on the back

1173
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,280
side

1174
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,319
of quantum computing to call it somehow

1175
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,359
and and that's happens when when we deal

1176
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,319
with the real devices right uh so far up

1177
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,680
to this point we have been running

1178
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,240
everything

1179
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,839
in a simulator that simulates a

1180
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,400
quadcopter an ideal quantity computer

1181
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,359
but really quantum computers are are

1182
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,720
harder to deal with right

1183
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,200
and the the reason for that is because

1184
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,880
as charlie also mentioned

1185
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,680
the problem of noise so let's write the

1186
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,400
same

1187
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,680
dodge algorithm but in a real device

1188
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,599
right so for that i will ask to the

1189
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,800
ibm cloud service to give me

1190
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,440
the less bc backend that is not a

1191
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,400
simulator

1192
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,040
and has at least two qubits

1193
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,680
the vacuum that is bringing back it's a

1194
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,400
one called ibm q valencia

1195
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,960
this is a is a packet with five qubits

1196
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,200
that they organize in a particular way

1197
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,319
that means that for example it's

1198
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,720
possible to do a c note between zero and

1199
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,359
one

1200
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,800
but it's not possible to do a c not

1201
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,559
between zero and two

1202
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,720
that kind of limitations is the one that

1203
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,559
charlie refers to i have to make sure

1204
00:48:58,559 --> 00:48:59,680
that the problem

1205
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,000
fits in my hardware that's one of the

1206
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,920
challenges that we have to solve

1207
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,880
and see there are 13 pending jobs to be

1208
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,520
executing

1209
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,200
on this hardware so even when it's the

1210
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,680
least busy one is quite busy

1211
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,720
um and an important part that i would

1212
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,559
like to show you here is this part the

1213
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:16,960
part

1214
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,160
where i have information about the error

1215
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,160
so also charlie mentioned there are a

1216
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,319
lot of sources of error

1217
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,480
there are errors with coherence

1218
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,319
basically just for

1219
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,040
for time passing that it is hard to hold

1220
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,400
the quantum state

1221
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,480
there are errors in the calibration when

1222
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,599
we try to set

1223
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,640
a signal in a particular

1224
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,680
state is imprecise there are errors when

1225
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,599
we reach that particular state

1226
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,920
there are errors all around and is the

1227
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,520
kind of things that add

1228
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,880
noise and now let's let's send our

1229
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,640
secret instead of to a

1230
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,720
to a simulator to this quantum computer

1231
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,480
this process will take some time because

1232
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,319
remember there are some

1233
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,680
some uh jobs in the gym

1234
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,920
uh so i we can we can come back in a sec

1235
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,480
when the

1236
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,000
the result is there let me see if i if i

1237
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,520
if i if i check it out

1238
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,270
how long this might take

1239
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,960
[Music]

1240
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,280
so the job that i just sent i can check

1241
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,720
it out where is the start with the job

1242
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:24,960
is

1243
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,359
still waging the queue and at some point

1244
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,280
these status will be done

1245
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,880
and we can see what are the results for

1246
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,359
touch so

1247
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,720
let's wait for for some time for that

1248
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,359
a few moments later

1249
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,720
okay now we are back now the the job is

1250
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,760
uh done and

1251
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,359
let's see what are the results of that

1252
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,599
job

1253
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,400
but let's check it out

1254
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,160
the the result was that many times the

1255
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,839
result was constant

1256
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,760
and let's see check it out that that

1257
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,400
indeed the the real result is constant

1258
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,400
in in the ideal simulated the result was

1259
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,559
constant that makes sense but notice

1260
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:08,960
there are

1261
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,400
some times that the result was not a

1262
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,280
constant right uh let's see how many

1263
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,280
times

1264
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,280
so six times the result was not constant

1265
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,559
right and this is this is the

1266
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,200
consequence of the of the noise

1267
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,880
of the fact that we are running in a

1268
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,720
non-ideal computer in a real hardware

1269
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,400
now now let's let's go to the to the

1270
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,599
the part that probably are working for

1271
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,480
is let's let's try to factor a number

1272
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:38,960
and yeah

1273
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,520
we're going to factor a small number 15

1274
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,040
i hope you're not disappointed with this

1275
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,400
situation

1276
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,920
but because it's really not in the in

1277
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,280
the current state of

1278
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,880
there is not really much more than we

1279
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,680
can do than than 20 project 15

1280
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,359
number three as a matter of fact it's

1281
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,119
very hard to factor 15 in the real

1282
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,880
computers so usually we do

1283
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,720
we do simulations with factoring science

1284
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,559
electricity

1285
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,440
and that's it that's a hard problem the

1286
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,680
point of this demo is so you can get

1287
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,119
a bit of understanding of why this myth

1288
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,280
that um that the quantum computer is the

1289
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,240
end

1290
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,000
of the passing computer of security in

1291
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,880
general classical in general and it's

1292
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,160
because things are not

1293
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,200
so directly right so so we're going to

1294
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,040
to shop on something very famous called

1295
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,319
the short algorithm

1296
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,960
which is a way to factor numbers so

1297
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,040
there are very very

1298
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,520
many cryptographic systems there that

1299
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,200
the strength of that system

1300
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,319
is based the fact that you cannot easily

1301
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,599
factor a very large nub er

1302
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,720
the same thing applies to this uh limit

1303
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,240
describe logarithms on the contents so

1304
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,000
so it is supposed to run the short

1305
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,800
hardware in

1306
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,880
in a classical computer it's just

1307
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,400
basically this is

1308
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,839
takes as much as the as a in a

1309
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,440
as factor in the number right it's super

1310
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,480
polynomial so the the point here is that

1311
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,160
we're going to split the problem in two

1312
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,599
we're going to turn the product

1313
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,800
into finding an order uh

1314
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,200
and this kind of order finding problem

1315
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,079
is something that

1316
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,480
it can be represent as much as

1317
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,599
multiplication

1318
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,359
and therefore uh um

1319
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,599
quantum computers are better at than

1320
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:26,880
classical computers right

1321
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,480
but also this is a problem that can be

1322
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,240
solved classically happens to be super

1323
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,119
polynomial

1324
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,880
but but if the quantum computer is not

1325
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,640
supported right

1326
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,119
and and the way that the strategy that

1327
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,000
he discussed

1328
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,359
is that basically we are going to

1329
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,000
have several tries and we're going we're

1330
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,800
going to get

1331
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,920
better guests in every iteration right

1332
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,599
and here we're not going to jump into

1333
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,200
the details of what

1334
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,960
that requires but um i would like to

1335
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,040
give you a hint on the size of the kind

1336
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,640
of cubita okay

1337
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,960
so the first thing is like requires two

1338
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,880
attempts because i told you like

1339
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,599
factoring in with your algorithm means

1340
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,240
means that

1341
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,640
means making guests and making better

1342
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,000
guests in each iteration

1343
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
this for example requires two attempts

1344
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,599
to factory 15

1345
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,520
and indeed it found the the factors

1346
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,960
five and three and let's figure out what

1347
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,200
is

1348
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,520
the kind of circuit that we need for

1349
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,800
doing that

1350
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,720
so this is secret that we need for for

1351
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,800
running show algorithm

1352
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,359
and each of these boxes it's

1353
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,400
particularly

1354
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,480
big i mean even when it doesn't start

1355
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,440
the

1356
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,960
the hardware cannot implement these

1357
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,119
boxes per se so we have to decompose

1358
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:39,839
this in

1359
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,920
small gates that can be implemented in

1360
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,040
the hardware

1361
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,640
and at the end there is something called

1362
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,079
the qft

1363
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,960
that's the quantum fourier transform but

1364
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,240
also is something

1365
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,720
that has to be decomposed in several

1366
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,880
cubes in several gates

1367
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,200
in how many gates let's check it out the

1368
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,640
first thing that we have to do is to

1369
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,839
choose a backend

1370
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,760
in this case we have to choose something

1371
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,680
that fits our problem

1372
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,720
right here we need 12 qubits so we need

1373
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,240
to choose something big enough

1374
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,160
the first the the best thing that we can

1375
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,839
fit in is in the ibm

1376
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,760
q16 melber this computer has

1377
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,880
15 cubits and

1378
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,720
and notice that the amount of gates that

1379
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,079
can implement are not

1380
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,160
the same amount of gates that we need

1381
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,760
right so these gates they need to be

1382
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,040
decomposed they need to be

1383
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,079
getting into into primitive gates that

1384
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,000
can be implemented

1385
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,280
and um and

1386
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,040
and let's see what happens if we want to

1387
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,400
execute that

1388
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,559
circuit that we have in the top into

1389
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:43,680
this backend

1390
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,119
for that we have to do something that we

1391
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,960
call it transpile which is similar to

1392
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,599
the

1393
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,400
the compilation system where we attach a

1394
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,960
quantum circuit to a specific hardware

1395
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,400
so this will give us a a circuit

1396
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,880
that fits into the hardware where we

1397
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,079
want to run

1398
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,119
the the the circuit name

1399
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,760
this it takes some time it's

1400
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,359
understandable

1401
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,520
because it's really so the compilation

1402
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,880
process is the one taking some time here

1403
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,720
we are not executing the the secret

1404
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,440
itself

1405
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,520
but we are adapting the secret to the

1406
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,960
hour specifically

1407
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,720
and now we can see which kind of

1408
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,799
operations do we have there

1409
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:24,160
for example it requires almost 19 000

1410
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,920
synods requires a

1411
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,520
like a 12 that's around 12

1412
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,720
000 a single qubit operations

1413
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,839
it it's a it's a really big big

1414
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,040
uh um circuit

1415
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,160
only again to factor 15 and

1416
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,880
a second with this depth basically that

1417
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,440
the depth

1418
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,839
is there is this size so so we can even

1419
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,720
measure the depth here let me see

1420
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,040
physical circuit

1421
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,680
i think yes the the secret with this

1422
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,559
depth this

1423
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,559
the amount of gates that we need to

1424
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,480
apply in a circuit

1425
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,520
is a 19 000 that means that the

1426
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,799
coherence

1427
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,799
will not hold that long and therefore

1428
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,000
the result will be just

1429
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
noise right so so also

1430
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,960
it's important to know that just trying

1431
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,280
to

1432
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,599
factor 15 is already a challenge

1433
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,480
a big challenge for for real for

1434
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,280
nowadays

1435
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,680
uh real quantum computers but the hope

1436
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,400
is that

1437
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,040
the technology gets better better and i

1438
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,240
and

1439
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,799
and and where i am into that right a

1440
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:37,280
small

1441
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,839
army of scientists trying to to find the

1442
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,599
the the answer to a lot of open

1443
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,440
questions to improve

1444
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,760
the form the the goal of ibm for 2023

1445
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,960
is to have a computer that can execute 1

1446
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,319
000 cubits

1447
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,760
um still that will not be enough

1448
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,240
but with time we're going to get better

1449
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,440
better

1450
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,720
at this charlie okay

1451
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,480
but but it we are very far from breaking

1452
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,440
absolutely breaking the security with

1453
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,119
quantum computers as we can see we we

1454
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,960
saw today okay just wrapping this up

1455
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,520
some conclusions about this uh uh

1456
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,319
one thing that we didn't mention was uh

1457
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:27,680
something about quantum

1458
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,440
supremacy um there are a lot of

1459
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,599
companies that are trying to achieve

1460
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,680
quantum supremacy supremacy it

1461
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,280
is important because this means that

1462
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,720
it's different achievements in this

1463
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,839
in this race but quantum supremacy

1464
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,280
itself

1465
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,200
doesn't mean anything if you want to

1466
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,319
go to to practical uh

1467
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,920
results of this okay in fact we have

1468
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,599
many of you maybe remember uh

1469
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,559
news about google achieving quantum

1470
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,240
supremacy

1471
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,359
last year because they could solve

1472
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,880
a problem uh you know a problem that

1473
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,839
it's not

1474
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,680
practical but it doesn't matter what the

1475
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,359
supremacy said that you can

1476
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,200
solve problems that are not real

1477
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,640
relevant but

1478
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,290
that cannot be resolved in in

1479
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,400
[Music]

1480
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,880
in a practical way in classical

1481
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,640
computers okay

1482
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,079
he claimed that they did that but ibm

1483
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,960
a couple of weeks later say that it was

1484
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,240
not so because they could solve the same

1485
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,200
problems in a supercomputer in

1486
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,640
a couple of days so they didn't uh

1487
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,040
achieve the quant supremacy okay this is

1488
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,680
one of the

1489
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,680
the claim from google was that they

1490
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,040
created a problem

1491
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,599
again yeah useful or practical in any

1492
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,240
way but

1493
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,079
supremacy is this idea that it's

1494
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,000
possible to solve a problem

1495
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,280
in a problem in a time that is feasible

1496
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,280
while solving the same problem in a

1497
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,359
classical computer it's not feasible

1498
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,400
so google uh so create their own problem

1499
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,160
and they solve a problem

1500
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,960
uh that according with google required

1501
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,359
10

1502
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:18,960
000 uh execution years

1503
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,240
and an ibm show that was possible to

1504
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,640
solve

1505
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,520
that very same problem in in some days

1506
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,400
and again

1507
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,920
this quantum supervise is talking about

1508
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,839
a problem and this problem

1509
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,280
is not useful in any way no

1510
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,799
of course it's just to to do some some

1511
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,000
progress in the

1512
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,280
in in the computing race okay so

1513
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,200
what we think we are in

1514
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,480
in an age of quantum computer like

1515
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,720
in uh a thousand uh

1516
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,559
um at a

1517
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,480
years when they started to use

1518
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,559
vacuum tubes to do something in

1519
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,559
electronics we are very very

1520
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,920
far from doing things that will really

1521
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,559
really

1522
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,160
change the world that we know okay

1523
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,960
okay this is the analogy is very close

1524
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,760
to because

1525
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,480
also quantum computers as primitive

1526
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,160
classical computers they still also

1527
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,200
require

1528
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,680
a group of people going around them

1529
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,480
constantly

1530
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,520
keeping the the electronics running

1531
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,799
recalibrating so so the the

1532
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,599
they really require people on the ground

1533
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,839
on the lab

1534
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:39,119
to keep them running as was true for the

1535
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,240
for the first computer's classification

1536
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,200
that that we have uh several decades ago

1537
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,880
okay so what is real is that there are a

1538
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,599
lot of

1539
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,680
quantum computers and there are a lot of

1540
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,920
companies that are working a lot

1541
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,200
to make this dream possible

1542
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,119
and here you have uh six of them that

1543
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,200
are a public er available

1544
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,280
some of them are more available than the

1545
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,640
others but

1546
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,680
never mind you have you can apply to

1547
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,559
these

1548
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,599
sites to sanado to ibm

1549
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,119
to d wave to righty to microsoft

1550
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,160
to amazon too

1551
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,280
to learn to use these computers

1552
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,319
to play with them

1553
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,520
and to make this uh

1554
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,880
this will move faster we encourage you

1555
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,319
to do that

1556
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:41,440
uh it's very interesting this really

1557
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,559
cutting through and we we hope

1558
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:48,480
you you can go and and do your own

1559
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,760
algorithms that

1560
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,799
are really useful for someone

1561
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,880
for humanity okay so here you have some

1562
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,599
references

1563
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,880
about uh what this presentation

1564
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,079
how we have used and we want to

1565
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,119
thank you a lot for being there and

1566
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,319
these are our

1567
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:12,319
contacts and thank you very much for

1568
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:16,319
for being uh watching this we this

1569
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:19,039
presentation thank you and see you in

1570
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,680
the next

1571
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,400
gray hat hopefully in a physical place

1572
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,559
with physical people

1573
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:31,839
we hope so yeah bye

1574
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,760
