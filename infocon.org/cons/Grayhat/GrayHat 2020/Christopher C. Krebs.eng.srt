00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
folks from the infosec community

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,200
trying to increase and improve the

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,719
partnerships and the

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,039
interactions between the security

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,559
research community and the federal

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,440
government

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,360
so more to come there but check us out

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,800
sisa.gov

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,760
careers all right now into the content

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,160
so

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,120
i'm going to talk to you about a few

33
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,280
things today first is the trusted

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,040
relationships that we're trying to build

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,000
here at system

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
and in part who we are and then i'm

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
going to move into a

38
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
practical application of the things that

39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
we do here and that trust building

40
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,759
that we uh that we work on so hard here

41
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,560
it says that in

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,920
in a discrete application of election

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,040
security

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,360
i want to note though that i'm coming to

45
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
you from the past

46
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
we're taping this from when you're

47
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,439
viewing it a couple weeks ago

48
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,640
now in cyber security and infosec

49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
things can change on a dime things can

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,759
change

51
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,240
and happen very quickly so what i'm

52
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,079
telling you right now is based on what i

53
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,520
know today

54
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,200
october 14th my hope is that

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
nothing happens it's a pretty boring

56
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
couple weeks but hey

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,560
i am you know a bit on the para

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,880
okay so sissa who are we well we are a

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,840
federal civilian agency that means we're

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,759
not in the intelligence community

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,360
we're not in the department of defense

62
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,119
we're not law enforcement

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,200
we're a civilian agency that really

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,758
thrives on public-private partnerships

65
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,239
what does that mean that means that we

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,080
have to work with you

67
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
in the private sector and the security

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,040
research community in the state and

69
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
local government space in the federal

70
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
space

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,560
to help build an understanding of what

72
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
the risks we face across

73
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,680
any number of threat and vulnerability

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,599
spaces and consequence

75
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,760
of potential consequences and we have to

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
build initiatives and programs that help

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
drive that risk down

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
we have to do it collaboratively part of

79
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,560
what we do

80
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
is work to understand what it is that

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,239
you're concerned about

82
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,560
uh and then we build those programs

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
together we can bring intelligence we

84
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,519
can bring

85
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,440
other understanding that we have we we

86
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
offer that to you and put you in a

87
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,160
position to best

88
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
manage the risk uh that you're

89
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,160
responsible for so so in a sense we're

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,800
the nation's risk manager or i'm sorry

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,159
actually more appropriately

92
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,640
the nation's risk advisor you're the

93
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,360
ones

94
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,319
that manage the risk we advise on how to

95
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:06,800
best

96
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,879
manage that risk over the last few years

97
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,400
because we're coming up on our second

98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
birthday we've really focused on

99
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
becoming a customer-centric organization

100
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
and and really more than anything

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
that just means figuring out what our

102
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,640
demand signal

103
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,440
is from our stakeholder base again you

104
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,799
and then

105
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,200
providing some sort of value to you to

106
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,799
help address the things that you're

107
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,080
concerned about

108
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
everything we do is voluntary so i have

109
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,720
to understand what it is you need

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
and provide my services and again i'll

111
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,319
talk about that in the context of

112
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,120
elections

113
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
and how we've supported those efforts

114
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,599
but regardless of what it is

115
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,440
pub in this public-private partnership

116
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
space everything is centered on

117
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,519
trust if you don't trust me

118
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
if you don't trust sysa then you're not

119
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,040
going to work with us

120
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,360
if i don't trust you then we're gonna

121
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,879
have a hard time understanding

122
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
what it is that you need and then

123
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
building our programs around so

124
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,200
again everything we do here is about

125
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,840
trust it's about building a big tent

126
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,239
and having all the relevant parties come

127
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:12,959
together

128
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,439
and manage this risk all right so let's

129
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,399
get into a little

130
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,199
discussion about election security let

131
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,639
me start with the threat landscape and

132
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,079
the things we're seeing out there and

133
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,479
then

134
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,400
i'll talk about the things that we've

135
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,919
been doing over the last several years

136
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,400
and this

137
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
progress and the successes we've had and

138
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,520
i'll close out

139
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,400
with what you the last line of defense

140
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,720
and

141
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,759
american democracy are able to do

142
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,880
so on the threat landscape i think back

143
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
to 2016.

144
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
think back to uh what seemed to have

145
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
come out of left field

146
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
or out of the blue was this russian

147
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,520
effort to interfere

148
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
with our elections with our way of life

149
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
with our democracy

150
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,759
and it manifested along three different

151
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,199
primary lines of attack

152
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
first was attempts to

153
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
interfere with election infrastructure

154
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,919
those are the systems that

155
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,840
we all interact with and election

156
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,160
officials at the state local

157
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
level used to actually facilitate an

158
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,840
election

159
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,759
the second was was these hack and leak

160
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,680
campaigns against political

161
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
operatives the campaigns themselves uh

162
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,520
and then release

163
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
information to damage a candidate or

164
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,639
change the way we think about things

165
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,960
and then lastly was just this broader

166
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,919
disinfo

167
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,199
disinformation effort that that's really

168
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,720
never stopped

169
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
to really get into our heads so one side

170
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
you've got technical hacking this is

171
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,759
more of a psychological hacking

172
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,360
it's a perception hack it's getting

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
inside of our brains

174
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,400
amplifying issues uh beyond what

175
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,720
we may otherwise think of them and get

176
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,520
us to

177
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
both change the way we view the world

178
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
but ultimately

179
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,400
undermine our confidence in us who we

180
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,919
are as americans who we are

181
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,759
in the the democratic processes and

182
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
institutions that underpin

183
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
our way of life we here at cisa are

184
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
responsible for supporting that first

185
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,120
line of

186
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
attack or countering that first line of

187
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,560
attack the election infrastructure

188
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,160
so in 2016 we saw a range of actors

189
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
in the russian intelligence and military

190
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,520
services space

191
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
try to get into a number of different

192
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,039
state systems

193
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,440
the way we look at it they scanned they

194
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,479
researched

195
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
all 50 states we they did have some

196
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,080
success

197
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
in penetrating a voter registration

198
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
database in illinois

199
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
and they were able to access some a

200
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,759
handful of systems in some counties

201
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,280
in florida uh the access they had though

202
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,080
was limited uh and their ability to

203
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,199
change

204
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,240
uh a vote a single vote manipulate

205
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,680
the count was non-existent and we remain

206
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,880
pretty confident that

207
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,360
that holds true that they're not in a

208
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,880
position they're not able to

209
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
change a single vote in american

210
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,000
democracy

211
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,639
as we look now what we're seeing across

212
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
the threat landscape

213
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,560
uh we're informed by two or three

214
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,360
different

215
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
uh perspectives first is our

216
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,160
intelligence community is always out

217
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
there

218
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,319
the intelligence community between the

219
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,639
nsa cia

220
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,599
the fbi and others are always out there

221
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,800
looking to see

222
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,880
and spot those who might do us harm stop

223
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,919
them where they are

224
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,639
and help inform the network defenders

225
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,240
back here so they can harden their

226
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,199
their systems we also have an improved

227
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,240
visibility

228
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,960
over the state networks that support

229
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
elections all 50 states

230
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
so that if there is any sort of

231
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
anomalous activity

232
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,360
that we're able to detect it we can

233
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
alert on it

234
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
we can investigate and we can stop it

235
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,639
is that the relationships we have now

236
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
with state and local election officials

237
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,840
is so informative and so robust that

238
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,720
when they see

239
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
things they report to us early often and

240
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,000
late

241
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
so the position we're in is incredibly

242
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
advanced as opposed to where we were in

243
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,039
2016.

244
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,879
and so the scope and scale of the 2016

245
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,160
activities was far and away

246
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,280
much more active than where we are today

247
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,960
based on those three lines of reporting

248
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,479
that we have here today

249
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,240
we're not seeing anything that we can

250
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
really attribute to a focused targeted

251
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,960
activity

252
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
or campaign against our election

253
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,120
activity that's not to say though

254
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,800
that there's not activity that we're

255
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
seeing every day and what we

256
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,519
see is what you see from where you sit

257
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,360
whether you've got a honeypot deployed

258
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,880
or whatever it is

259
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
you see that there are actors out there

260
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,159
across the internet that are scanning

261
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,399
scanning scanning on a regular basis

262
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,160
looking for vulnerabilities looking for

263
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,000
open rdp or other ports

264
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
that they can exploit and then move

265
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,600
within the network grab the domain

266
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,480
controller

267
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,519
and do whatever they want that's true of

268
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,959
federal government

269
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,200
agency networks that's true state locals

270
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
the private sector

271
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
uh so on and so on you see it every day

272
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
you know what's happening

273
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,040
and within that we are seeing a range of

274
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,399
actors nation state

275
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,120
and criminals that are looking to

276
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,080
exploit

277
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,160
whatever the not just the latest

278
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,279
vulnerability

279
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,480
but some of those significant

280
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,160
vulnerabilities that have been uh

281
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,080
announced over the last year or so

282
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,760
they're chaining them together they're

283
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,080
compromising networks and in a limited

284
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,040
case or so

285
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,279
we have seen some compromises

286
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,040
non-targeted compromises

287
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
of election systems again i'm coming to

288
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
you from october

289
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
14 2020. my hope is that that remains

290
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,279
true

291
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,640
but we've got to anticipate

292
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,080
that there will be successful

293
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,839
compromises that they will be in a

294
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,080
position

295
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
within an election network and that's

296
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
what's informed our activities

297
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
over the last couple years and so let me

298
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,680
move into that space now

299
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,519
what have we been doing over the last

300
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,800
three and a half years

301
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
to prepare for the 2020 election if you

302
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,080
look right here

303
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,800
protect 2020 that's been our mantra here

304
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
at sisa and working with

305
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
the state and local governments across

306
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,440
the country as well as our interagency

307
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,480
partners now for

308
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
three and a half years we have been

309
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
working to build

310
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,040
a vibrant a robust election security

311
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,399
community of practice

312
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,000
so back in 2016 where a random county

313
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
cisso

314
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,959
or a state ciso or a state election

315
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,800
official may have felt as if they were

316
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
on their own trying to defend against

317
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,640
the gru

318
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,519
now they've got 49 other states standing

319
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,040
shoulder to shoulder with they've got

320
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,560
us assisted they've got the intelligence

321
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
community law enforcement department of

322
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,480
defense

323
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,000
the election assistance commission

324
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,640
everybody's pulled together within

325
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,720
a tight-knit group to defend democracy

326
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,160
to protect 2020.

327
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,839
we've set up an election infrastructure

328
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,160
isac all 50 states and thousands of

329
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,839
jurisdictions in 2016

330
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,600
there wasn't an ice act we pulled that

331
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,279
together in 2018

332
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
and got all 50 states over a matter of

333
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,959
months it was the fastest growing ice

334
00:10:58,959 --> 00:10:59,519
act

335
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,839
now look i know i sacks aren't the

336
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,040
silver bullet

337
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
but to be able to pull this community

338
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,160
together where we can share

339
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
information on the latest trends in

340
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,600
spear phishing

341
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,839
or brute force or whatever credential

342
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,120
based attacks there are

343
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
we can get that out abroad as broadly as

344
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,600
possible across the community

345
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,880
these are great great things the second

346
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,440
thing we've really been focused on

347
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,480
is improving the cyber security of the

348
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,360
networks

349
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,120
now state and locals whether you're in

350
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,760
elections in the tax department

351
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
or wherever you are in a state local

352
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,519
government you know that there are going

353
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,560
to be challenges

354
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,959
revenue streams are going to be down

355
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,000
because of covid

356
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
that means tax dollars are going to be

357
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
down that means that capital

358
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,839
investments in state local networks is

359
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,160
going to be down so it's going to take

360
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,040
that community-based approach that

361
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,720
collective based approach

362
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,639
to pull this thing together to get

363
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,079
everybody the information and the

364
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,200
resources they need

365
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
congress has stepped up over the last

366
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,959
three and a half or so years they've

367
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
provided 1.2 billion dollars

368
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,200
in grant funding to states now that's

369
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
spread out across all 50 states

370
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,639
and some of the resource demands are

371
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,800
pretty significant but we're seeing

372
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,000
improvement

373
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
so back to that threat conversation we

374
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,360
just had

375
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
and these relationships that we've been

376
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
building over the last several years

377
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
we've spent a big focus over since last

378
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
summer in fact on

379
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,600
discussing and raising awareness

380
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,360
of the threat of ransomware ransomware

381
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
is probably something that you don't

382
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,560
love dealing with

383
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,279
because in a lot of cases it's kind of

384
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,800
it's crap wear

385
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,079
but other cases it's pretty

386
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,959
sophisticated and you know i know my

387
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,279
honey analysts see it i know when i talk

388
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,880
to threat intelligence companies

389
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,399
sometimes it's a lot more fun a lot

390
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,800
cooler to be hunting hunting for

391
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,240
russian chinese iranian or other actors

392
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,200
but you know what the average american

393
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
the community out there

394
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
sees fields and is impacted by

395
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,240
ransomware

396
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,279
every single day regardless of the

397
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,120
sector whether it's manufacturing

398
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,360
whether it's health and public uh

399
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,959
patient care

400
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,680
state and local governments education so

401
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
in the dc area

402
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
right as schools were reopening fairfax

403
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
county one of the largest jurisdictions

404
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,320
counties in

405
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,000
in the in their area got hit with a

406
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
ransomware attack

407
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
so it's not just our businesses but it's

408
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
our kids it's our way of life

409
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
ransomware is as i see it the closest

410
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,040
thing to a global crisis

411
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,360
uh of course next to the pandemic in

412
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,200
kobet that we're in right now and

413
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,519
they're related because of this shift

414
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,360
towards remote work because of

415
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,839
this digital transformation the bad guys

416
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,800
aren't waiting they're

417
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,079
they're looking at this new attack

418
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,199
surface and they're looking how to

419
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,240
exploit it

420
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,160
so again we took this ransomware

421
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,000
conversation and took it to the states

422
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
we took it to our local

423
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
election officials and we we educated we

424
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
improved awareness and they got it

425
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,680
immediately because i

426
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,920
i suspect every single one of them has

427
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,680
seen it in their communities or in their

428
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,920
neighboring county or wherever they are

429
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,760
but when you think about the russian and

430
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,519
china and iranian these nation-state

431
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,320
threats

432
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,720
they don't show up waving their flag

433
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,680
they use

434
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,560
covert activities they're they obscure

435
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,600
and obfuscate

436
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,639
their activities as a technique as

437
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,560
a tactic the ransomware operators don't

438
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,000
they get in there they get what they

439
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,440
want they lock you up and they tell you

440
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,000
who they are

441
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,279
what they want and so this pivot allowed

442
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:31,600
us

443
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
to share a set of resources with them

444
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,560
you can find at sisa.gov ransomware

445
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
and allowed us to really raise awareness

446
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240
of a pernicious threat

447
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,199
now the advantage is that if you can

448
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,680
defend against a core set of

449
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,040
at least what the high profile

450
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
ransomware teams are using between emote

451
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,279
and trickbot then you can also probably

452
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,320
cover down on a number of the apt

453
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
techniques and reduce your risk to those

454
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,680
exposures

455
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,920
because of the availability of malware

456
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,639
as a service in this commodity space

457
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,399
that we're dealing with just the overlap

458
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,839
between nation states and cyber

459
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,720
criminals

460
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,760
is is only getting greater so

461
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,279
we were able to cover down on that we

462
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,040
were also able to work with our partners

463
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
in the intelligence community and

464
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,279
elsewhere

465
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,720
to share the risks of ransomware to the

466
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
systems that are out there

467
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,800
including election systems like voter

468
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,399
registration database

469
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,519
voter registration databases uh are

470
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,360
as i mentioned were one of the systems

471
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
targeted in 2016.

472
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
they're highly connected to the internet

473
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
that's that's how you can look up your

474
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,639
registration status that's how you can

475
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,160
send some information in that then

476
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,680
subsequently gets put in

477
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,880
to uh to the database we also think

478
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,839
about things like

479
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,720
election night reporting those systems

480
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,120
that

481
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,160
update unofficial results to uh to

482
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
the the main uh headquarters of the

483
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,680
election officials and sometimes

484
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,160
up to the internet again unofficial the

485
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
the official data is uh

486
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,320
communicated by a separate channel but

487
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
nonetheless these are systems

488
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,079
that could have a significant public

489
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,600
confidence impact

490
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,240
if you lost voter edge that we've seen

491
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,040
due to

492
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,480
whether it's contractor uh accidents

493
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,279
or other hardware failures that they can

494
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,440
knock systems offline at critical times

495
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,800
so we've got to make sure that they're

496
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
protected and we have seen them

497
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
the protection and the cyber security

498
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,040
posture of these systems improve

499
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,720
the center for election innovation and

500
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
research issued a report about a month

501
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,120
ago

502
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,240
it's a biennial report that compared to

503
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,639
their last report two years ago

504
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,199
shows that the improvement of deployment

505
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,600
of multi-factor authentication backups

506
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,639
logging in the systems audits

507
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,680
actual hard copy backups of voter edge

508
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
is is has improved over the last two

509
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,600
years these are great things it's about

510
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,519
the resilience in the system

511
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,959
now a quick sidebar here on why the heck

512
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,279
is there so much technology

513
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,920
in elections well election officials are

514
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,119
focused on

515
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,439
really two key things access to the

516
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,559
ballot access

517
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,880
that as many people are able to vote

518
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,000
that want to vote and

519
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,079
can do it in a seamless way that the

520
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,520
voting experience

521
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,520
uh can be is is as efficient as possible

522
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,959
and the second piece is they're they're

523
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,679
they push they really want accuracy is

524
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,760
accurate if possible is counting

525
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,679
so if everything is a human-enabled

526
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,480
system a human-enabled process

527
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,679
manual tabulation of ballots that both

528
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,280
adds time as well as uh accuracy

529
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
i've seen some studies that suggest that

530
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
human counted ballots

531
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,240
can reduce result in 20 error rates

532
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,679
so technology helps introduce efficiency

533
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,799
and accuracies assuming the technologies

534
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,799
are performing as intended and designed

535
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,240
and they're not being manipulated in

536
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,919
some system

537
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,559
so with all of this in mind technology

538
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
is also being introduced to the system

539
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,600
without you know with

540
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
in mind that that they're not a single

541
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
point of failure

542
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,840
that a single loss of the system is not

543
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,720
catastrophic for the entirety of the

544
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
process yeah you might lose a system

545
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
for a few hours but you can get it back

546
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,880
up and running or there's a workaround

547
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,120
and really it's it's just about

548
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,679
resilience it's about failing over into

549
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,880
another end state

550
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,280
that allows you to conduct the process

551
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
you're seeking to execute

552
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,039
even though it might take a little bit

553
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,480
more work it might take a little bit

554
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,000
more time

555
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
so that's what that's the mindset that

556
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,840
election officials have that's the

557
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,720
mindset

558
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,799
that we have when we think about the

559
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,720
cybersecurity of these systems how do we

560
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,280
increase security but how do we increase

561
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,160
resilience

562
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
and redundance in the system a great

563
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,400
news story

564
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480
over the last several years is the

565
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,799
introduction of analog

566
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,919
paper paper records and paper ballots

567
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,080
in the voting process and so we're not

568
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,200
reliant

569
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,120
on these systems these voting machines

570
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
that you've probably heard of

571
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
direct reporting recording equipment

572
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,480
those things that you touch

573
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
it counts your vote or registers your

574
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
vote on removable media

575
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
and there's no audit trail or

576
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,039
paper-based audit trail

577
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,160
so in 80 in in 2016

578
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
82 percent of the votes were cast with

579
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,679
those dres

580
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,400
in 2020 we're on track for better than

581
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,559
92 percent in fact

582
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,280
there's only one state left in the

583
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
united states

584
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,000
that has a statewide deployment of dres

585
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,960
that's louisiana there are states like

586
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,080
like texas

587
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,880
like tennessee indiana kentucky that

588
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,280
have

589
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
some use of these systems but the market

590
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,960
trends are away from

591
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,679
these dres i tell you what if louisiana

592
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,000
had an rfp out

593
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
that was later protested where they were

594
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,360
going to get rid of the dress and

595
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,039
replace them with machines that produce

596
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,240
a paper ballot

597
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,880
and other states did move off those dres

598
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,120
pennsylvania georgia south carolina

599
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,039
they've all got paper records associated

600
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,400
with the vote now

601
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
new jersey was one of those states like

602
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
louisiana that was planning on using

603
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,240
dres but because of

604
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
covid they shifted to absentee so that

605
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
means now they've got an audit trail

606
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,600
these again are great things i mean

607
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,440
every single one of you knows

608
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,720
that auditability is just a core

609
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,919
key tenet of a security process you've

610
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,440
got to be able to go back

611
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,360
and check the logs check the receipts

612
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,360
and build back up and understand

613
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,240
where any sort of anomaly may have

614
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,880
occurred

615
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,440
that's what a paper record gets you and

616
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,000
so you

617
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,080
when you vote need to be thinking about

618
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
it that way that is your record

619
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,200
that's what you're putting into the

620
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,679
system and they can verify the vote

621
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,280
okay so on the security side

622
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
in addition to improving the resilience

623
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,679
of the process and hardening voter edge

624
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,720
we're seeing uh improved behaviors in

625
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,240
terms of vulnerability management

626
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,200
patching we offer a series of tools and

627
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
services

628
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,159
vulnerability assessments penetration

629
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,559
testing we also have just a regular old

630
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,760
vulnerability scanning

631
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,200
tool uh that uses nessus and nmap it

632
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,320
allows us

633
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,919
to get out there and see the the status

634
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,919
of these systems we've deployed a new

635
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,240
tool called crossfeed that's also

636
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
filling in the gaps here

637
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,520
we're going to keep providing services

638
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,440
and capabilities to our partners

639
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,600
in state and local election land as well

640
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,960
as the broader state and local election

641
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,600
systems

642
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
because we know how they're under the

643
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,280
gun we know that they need additional

644
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,799
support and assistance so we're going to

645
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,320
keep providing that for them

646
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
we've also conducted a series of

647
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,520
elections

648
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,799
exercises four nationwide exercises

649
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,080
over the last several years we bring all

650
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,240
50 states together to work through a

651
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,679
range of scenarios

652
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,799
whether it's cyber physical or

653
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,880
or natural disaster there are a range of

654
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,520
things we can work on together

655
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,559
the last thing i'll talk about here is

656
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,480
the partnerships that we've pulled

657
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,320
together within the federal government

658
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
so up front i talked about that

659
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,360
50 state election community of practice

660
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,120
we've also had to get our house in order

661
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,559
inside the federal government

662
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,600
to make sure that we are providing all

663
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,400
the support

664
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
resources and the full powers of the

665
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
national security apparatus

666
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,840
in defense of our elections in support

667
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,159
of our state local election community

668
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,640
now i've said this for a while now that

669
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,760
i'm not aware

670
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,360
of any other endeavor in cyber security

671
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,120
in the federal government where you've

672
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,679
got such cohesiveness and collaboration

673
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,640
coordination

674
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,080
across the various elements of the

675
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,760
federal government and

676
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,000
just last week i heard one of my

677
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,799
partners

678
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,120
over in the national security agency led

679
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,600
by anne newberger

680
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
her team a member of her team said the

681
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,360
same thing and it

682
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,320
meant a lot to me that we've got this

683
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,679
trust build up

684
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,840
not only do we have trust with our state

685
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
and local partners but we have that

686
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,679
trust

687
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,440
within the federal government that we

688
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,039
know that we're doing everything within

689
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,120
our respective authorities and powers

690
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,320
to do the one thing that's worth doing

691
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
more than anything else and that's

692
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
defending democracy so

693
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,840
i need you the american voter to have

694
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,200
confidence

695
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,320
that you've got the federal team

696
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,919
you've got the state local team and

697
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,840
you've got our private sector vendors

698
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,440
and the social media platforms

699
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,600
that are doing everything possible to

700
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,480
defend

701
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,039
the 2020 election so that's what brings

702
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,520
me

703
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,440

704
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880

and three be a patient voter

713
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,400

715
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,000
exercise

716
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
your right to vote but when you do it

717
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,720
again remember what i was talking about

718
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,480
with that piece of paper

719
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,000
that record of your vote check it

720
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,080
regardless of what style of voting you

721
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,720
use whether it's in person or mail based

722
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
make sure that you follow the rules and

723
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,320
the instructions and the guidance

724
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,720
if you have questions if you're at home

725
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,600
voting from home

726
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,039
pick up the phone and call the voter

727
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,120
assistance line if you

728
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
are in person call an election official

729
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,840
over and ask for some help

730
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,080
but make sure that you're doing it right

731
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
and make sure that whatever you turn

732
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,679
in accurately reflects your vote

733
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,159
make sure that whoever you selected

734
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,520
that's what the thing

735
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,200
says second on being a participating

736
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,159
voter

737
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,080
make sure that you're getting

738
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,200
information from

739
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,320
accurate sources state and local

740
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,799
election officials are the authoritative

741
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,600
source

742
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,960
for information on u.s elections in fact

743
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,520
the constitution article 1 section 4

744
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,799
dictates that the

745
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,720
states determine the time place and

746
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,360
manner so if you've got questions

747
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,919
about how when or where you're supposed

748
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,880
to vote

749
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,320
go to your state or local election

750
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
official and that takes me to my second

751
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,720
p

752
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,919
be a prepared voter have a plan

753
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,200
don't just wake up on november 3rd

754
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,880
and think you're going to go vote yeah

755
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
you probably can but

756
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,279
don't let anybody introduce any

757
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,880
questions or doubt into your voting

758
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,400
process have a plan make sure

759
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,320
you're registered make sure you know

760
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,600
where you're going to go vote

761
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,720
make sure that you are that you have the

762
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
information you need

763
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,120
but i would say if you can

764
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,919
vote as early as possible because that

765
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,320
gives

766
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,279
us as the defenders the opportunity to

767
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,080
detect

768
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,919
any anomalies in the system if

769
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,480
everything piles up on november 3rd

770
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
that doesn't give us a sufficient

771
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,520
opportunity to

772
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,080
investigate and get on top of issues so

773
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,880
if you can

774
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
push it to the left a little bit vote as

775
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,960
early as possible that helps everybody

776
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,760
out

777
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,799
lastly be a patient voter and

778
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,679
now what does that mean well because of

779
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,520
the surge in absentee ballots in the

780
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,799
mail-in ballots

781
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,679
it may take a little bit more time to

782
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,080
crack

783
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,760
open the ballots and the envelopes and

784
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,240
count them all up but that's okay

785
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,960
because election day results november

786
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,520
3rd

787
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,279
results are always unofficial every

788
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,960
state has a timeline

789
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,000
set for certification of the process it

790
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,799
could take a week

791
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,240
it could take several weeks it depends

792
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,400
on each state but just know that the

793
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
election officials

794
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,720
in your state they're professionals

795
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,240
let them count they're on top of it

796
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,320
they're professional risk managers

797
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,640
and they need time to be able to do

798
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,360
their jobs

799
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
in a professional and responsible manner

800
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,120
so be patient

801
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,679
let's let them go i think there are

802
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
probably three states that were

803
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,720
we're thinking might take a little bit

804
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,039
longer between wisconsin michigan and

805
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,400
pennsylvania hopefully their state

806
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,360
legislatures

807
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,440
will allow for earlier counting but

808
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,039
those are probably three states that

809
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,880
we're going to need that extra dose of

810
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,720
patience for

811
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
so with that i'll close it out now

812
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,039
thanks again to grey hat for having me

813
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,159
and remember you the american voter are

814
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,000
the last line of defense

815
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
be a participating prepared and patient

816
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,399
voter and american voters

817
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,039
are going to decide american elections

818

819
