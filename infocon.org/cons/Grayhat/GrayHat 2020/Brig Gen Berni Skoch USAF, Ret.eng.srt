1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,679
hi i'm bernie scotch and i'm honored to

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,600
be with you today at gray hat

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,160
to discuss the air force association's

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,719
national youth cyber education program

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,160
also known as cyberpatriot

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,519
i'm joined today by two of my

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,960
distinguished colleagues rachel

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,680
zimmerman

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,199
and rebecca dalton who will give you

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,800
more detail on the program in a few

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,680
minutes

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,080
but as we begin this discussion i'd like

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,599
to devote a few minutes

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,640
to why cyberpatriot exists

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,160
the air force association is a

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,159
non-profit organization

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,160
and for decades we've been focused on

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,199
national security

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
now cyber patriot attempts to address

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,040
that issue

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,039
by attracting young women and young men

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,600
to stem education and careers

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
we're a youth cyber education program

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,680
and as you'll hear from rebecca and

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,879
rachel later

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,039
that encompasses several components of

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,920
the program

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,000
the biggest one is this youth cyber

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,520
defense competition that you'll be

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,879
hearing more about

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,640
but the overall purpose of cyber patriot

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
is to attract students to stem education

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,479
and careers

34
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,280
now a beneficial byproduct of what we do

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,159
is we generate

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,360
interest specifically in cyber security

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
and we've raised up a cadre through the

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,640
years that we've been running this

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,320
program of bright young men and young

40
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,119
women who've

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,880
gone on to great careers in cyber

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,479
security and stem and we'll be sharing

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,400
some of those statistics with you

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,720
but what's important to understand is

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,799
that cyber patriot is not only

46
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,240
about generating cyber security talent

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
but it's also about generating stem

48
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,040
talent to meet our nation's needs

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
now one thing that's very important to

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,960
understand is we're not hacker training

51
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,119
and we start everything that we do in

52
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,640
any of the components you'll be hearing

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,240
about in a few moments

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
with a discussion of cyber ethics and

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,759
why it's important

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,680
to do only ethical things when these

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,119
students are online

58
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,200
we don't teach hacking we don't teach

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,799
offensive techniques

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,320
now we're smart enough to know that if

61
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
someone learns good defensive techniques

62
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,520
they're probably going to

63
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,280
assimilate some of the information on

64
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,640
what it might take

65
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,280
to do some things offensively in the

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,160
cyber realm

67
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
but that's why we focus so much on cyber

68
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,080
ethics at the same time

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,440
but hacking is forbidden in the

70
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,160
competition and we teach only defensive

71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,200
skills

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
and it's also important to understand

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
that we're not a recruiting tool for the

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
united states air force or the

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,760
department of defense or any government

76
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
entity

77
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
this is about a national issue this is

78
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,319
about an issue for

79
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,160
your favorite airline it's about an

80
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,319
issue for your favorite retail chain

81
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,560
for your favorite logistics company for

82
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,319
state governments for municipal

83
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
governments for local responders

84
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,760
there's not a single enterprise in

85
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,319
america that isn't focused

86
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,040
on the need for strong cyber security

87
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,920
posture

88
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,080
and we think we've got a solution to

89
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,160
generating the talent that we need

90
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
i hope in what you hear later in this

91
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,680
presentation from rebecca and from

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,400
rachel

93
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
motivates you to become part of our

94
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
program maybe as a volunteer technical

95
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,959
mentor

96
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,640
so with that i'll turn it over to my

97
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,238
good colleague rebecca dalton

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
thanks bernie so as you can see

99
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,599
cyberpatriot encompasses

100
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,920
five programs they start at the

101
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,519
elementary school level

102
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
and then advance through the middle and

103
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
high school levels and we also offer a

104
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
program for senior citizens

105
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,280
the goal of all these programs is to

106
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
either educate

107
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,799
students on stem education and careers

108
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,640
or educate senior citizens about the

109
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
importance of cyber security

110
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
we're going to start off with an

111
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
explanation of the national youth

112
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,879
cyber defense competition because that

113
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,040
is our biggest program and that is how

114
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
cyber patriot

115
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
got its start first off let's

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,920
take a look at the skills that students

117
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,519
learn during the competition

118
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,120
it's very easy to jump down to the lower

119
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
bullets which are focused on the

120
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
the technical skills which is great

121
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,239
obviously we want to teach them the

122
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,799
technical skills that they need to go on

123
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,200
to pursue a cyber security career but

124
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
what we think is more important

125
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,159
are the top three skills which are cyber

126
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,680
ethics leadership and teamwork

127
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
creative and analytical problem solving

128
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,920
cyber ethics is always our first lessons

129
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
very important students can't go on and

130
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
learn stuff before they understand

131
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
the importance of cyber ethics

132
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,079
additionally leadership and teamwork is

133
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,120
something that's

134
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
not traditionally offered in cyber

135
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,600
security programs

136
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
of course it's an opportunity for those

137
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,360
students who participate

138
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
on sporting teams or you know in various

139
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,840
clubs like debate club or something

140
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
they'd have leadership and teamwork

141
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
opportunities

142
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,120
cyberpatriot creates that for students

143
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,479
who wouldn't otherwise

144
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,000
you know be involved in some of those

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
other student activities

146
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
lastly creative and analytical problem

147
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
solving is a huge skill

148
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,320
that students learn in cyber security

149
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,080
and it's a skill that employers really

150
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,040
look for

151
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,840
on you know resumes

152
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,240
the competition itself is kind of a

153
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
three-step process for getting involved

154
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,639
first the coach registers the team the

155
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
coach can be

156
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,639
a teacher at the school a parent of one

157
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,560
of the students competing on the team or

158
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
the leader of a youth organization

159
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,160
and that coach once they register adds

160
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
the students to the roster a student can

161
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
have anywhere from two to six students

162
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
per team

163
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
there's also the option to have a

164
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
technical mentor

165
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,000
and we'll explain this a little more

166
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
that's the person who

167
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,880
possesses the cyber cyber security

168
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,720
skills needed

169
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
to really teach the students what they

170
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
need to know for the competition

171
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,720
once a team registers they jump into the

172
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,440
training

173
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,160
we offer at least three training rounds

174
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
throughout the summer months into the

175
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,960
early fall

176
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
so teams can prepare for the competition

177
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
we also offer

178
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,120
12 training modules that are available

179
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
to coaches at any

180
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,800
time to share with their students this

181
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,680
training

182
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,759
will get them ready for the first round

183
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,120
of competition

184
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,600
competitions begin in in mid-fall

185
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
usually

186
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
and every team is guaranteed three

187
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,880
scored online rounds

188
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,639
they earn points for how well they find

189
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,000
and fix cyber's

190
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,560
vulnerabilities and the top teams

191
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,440
advance

192
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,719
to the national finals

193
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,840
now you might be wondering what does

194
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,600
this competition actually look like what

195
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
are the students doing

196
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,560
well this is a picture of one of our

197
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,280
competition

198
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,000
images an image is essentially a virtual

199
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
operating system

200
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,080
that we've purposely put cyber security

201
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,440
flaws into

202
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
and teams are tasked with finding and

203
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,600
fixing these vulnerabilities

204
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,560
within a set amount of time so in this

205
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,360
case this

206
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,120
is a you know a windows image

207
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,680
and you can see the yellow box there is

208
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
a readme file which offers a scenario

209
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,240
for the students so the students sign in

210
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,639
they immediately look at the readme file

211
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,599
and they

212
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,080
basically gather some information about

213
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
certain policies that this you know

214
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
imaginary company has that they have to

215
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
follow

216
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
so as they go through the image they

217
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
find and fix these flaws they earn

218
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
points for example if they add passwords

219
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,000
to all the user accounts

220
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
they might earn 10 points but if they go

221
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,919
and turn off their firewall maybe

222
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,599
they'll lose five points

223
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,160
so they're scored live on how well they

224
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
are remediating

225
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,479
and securing this virtual operating

226
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,039
system

227
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,280
the operating systems um vary from round

228
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
to round so we have you know

229
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,240
various windows operating systems linux

230
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
kabuto and debian images

231
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,919
and the images get progressively harder

232
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,240
as students advance through

233
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,880
the various rounds in addition to these

234
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,199
images students also have to complete

235
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,400
a cisco networking academy quiz and

236
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,039
packet tracer exercise

237
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,199
cisco's is nice enough to offer

238
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,120
networking academy

239
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
access to all of the participants

240
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,400
involved

241
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
which is really good training so we do

242
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
quiz them on that as well

243
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,879
it's important to note that in order to

244
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,000
successfully

245
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
you know compete you do have to make

246
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
sure that your host machines meet the

247
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,400
minimum

248
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
software and hardware requirements all

249
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
the software that's required

250
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
to participate is offered for free and

251
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,599
we provide

252
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,680
the download links for those we also

253
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,599
require certain hardware minimums

254
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,160
and that includes you know 64-bit

255
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,919
processor

256
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,039
at least eight gigs of ram um four gigs

257
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
might you know called performance issues

258
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
and 40 gigs of free disk space

259
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,120
so there are some you know requirements

260
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,559
that should be met otherwise you might

261
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,080
run into issues

262
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,959
but for the most part students and

263
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,200
schools don't really have an issue

264
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
meeting these requirements because they

265
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
work with their it departments to get

266
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,000
everything set up

267
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,279
the typical timeline for a competition

268
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,279
is april to march

269
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,480
april is when registration opens and

270
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
teams can start signing up and

271
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
throughout

272
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
the spring and into early fall

273
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,760
students and coaches can access various

274
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,000
practice rounds so you see any blue box

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
there is an unscored practice round

276
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,519
the registration deadlines usually in

277
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,440
early to mid october

278
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
and then the actual scored rounds of

279
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,640
competition kick

280
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,120
off in late october to mid-november

281
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,959
this year because of coronavirus we did

282
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,720
have to limit it to three rounds because

283
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,680
we needed to

284
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
schedule extra time for teams to

285
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,000
register with virtual schooling things

286
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,640
were

287
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
you know a little tricky to get figured

288
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
out

289
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
but you see rounds one two and three all

290
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,839
teams can compete in those

291
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,519
rounds and we're also offering the

292
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
option for in-home participation

293
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,200
typically teams would meet at their

294
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,959
schools in the computer lab in a

295
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:55,680
classroom

296
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
and would be together for the six hour

297
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
competition

298
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
because that's not always an option at

299
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,000
this you know

300
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,279
current state of the country we are

301
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,959
allowing students to compete from their

302
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
individual homes

303
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,200
obviously safety of the competitors is

304
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,959
important so we wanted to accommodate

305
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,199
that

306
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,920
competition growth has been really

307
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
strong since the beginning of the

308
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,040
program

309
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,640
in 2009 we actually had eight teams that

310
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,959
competed in the pilot program

311
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,200
if you fast forward to 2019 we had

312
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,279
nearly 6 800 teams

313
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,760
so you can see from the chart here the

314
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,519
number of teams which are the blue bars

315
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,560
and the number of students

316
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,279
for the gray bars you know the numbers

317
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,800
have really taken off

318
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,880
2020 we don't expect the registration to

319
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
quite reach where it was last year for

320
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,760
obvious reasons

321
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,839
a lot of schools had to cancel extra

322
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,519
curricular activities

323
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,320
but we are still around the 5 000 team

324
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,959
mark which we're really pleased to see

325
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,839
the fees for registering are pretty

326
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,640
modest

327
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,279
it's 205 dollars per high school team

328
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,560
and 165 dollars per middle school team

329
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,640
but in a lot of cases we will waive the

330
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,079
fee for teams

331
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,000
any school that's considered a title one

332
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,079
school will

333
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,920
qualify for a fee waiver when we we

334
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
don't make them pay

335
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,480
any team that's an all-female team

336
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
also gets a fee waiver if they apply for

337
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,160
it and that's because we're

338
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,000
obviously trying to attract more young

339
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
women into cyber security because

340
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
it's mostly male-dominated field in

341
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
addition to those two waivers we do

342
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,360
offer

343
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
automatic waivers for junior rotc

344
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,640
civil air patrol and naval seat cadet

345
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,920
corps teams

346
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,519
and that's because of an agreement that

347
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,160
we have with the service headquarters

348
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,360
the competition itself is split up into

349
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
three different divisions

350
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
so students compete in either the open

351
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,279
division the all service division or the

352
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,560
middle school division

353
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
and it's all based on what type of

354
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,920
organization they're registered with so

355
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,279
the open division is our largest

356
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:01,920
division

357
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,399
making up 53 of teams and that's your

358
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,880
general high school population

359
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
regular students at public school

360
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,160
private schools really any type of

361
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,800
school

362
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,440
or any type of youth organization 4-h

363
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
club boys girls club scouting units

364
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,399
etc the all-service division

365
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,360
makes up 28 of the teams and those are

366
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,120
for high school students who are

367
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,399
part of either jrotc

368
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,519
in any service civil air patrol or naval

369
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,560
seat cadet corps

370
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,360
and as i mentioned those students don't

371
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,399
pay any registration fee to participate

372
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
and then the newest division is our

373
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
middle school division which

374
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
we added i think during our sixth season

375
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,160
of

376
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,519
competition and that is for any student

377
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,440
registered or enrolled in a middle

378
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
school or registered to a middle school

379
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
school-aged

380
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,040
youth program

381
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,680
so it's one thing to have a large

382
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,639
participation

383
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,720
in the competition but it's another

384
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,079
thing to understand

385
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,880
you know is the program actually working

386
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,320
so every two years

387
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
we do what we call an alumni survey and

388
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,800
we you know reach out to current

389
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,760
and past cyberpatriot competitors and we

390
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,200
ask them what their plans are for the

391
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,639
future if they're still in high school

392
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,040
or

393
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,560
what are they doing now now that they've

394
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
graduated high school or graduated

395
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,920
college

396
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,800
so 75 percent of current cyber patriot

397
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,760
students

398
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,720
are planning to pursue stem education um

399
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,760
and

400
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,480
some education or careers and that is

401
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,760
compared to a 20

402
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,279
national average so that's fantastic to

403
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,399
see

404
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,639
of our students who've already graduated

405
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
high school and are either in college or

406
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,760
in the workforce

407
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,519
84 percent of them are doing

408
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,720
something in a stem related field

409
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,880
again that's compared to a 20 national

410
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,240
average so

411
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,560
we're really thrilled with that um but

412
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,360
we know

413
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
that well maybe we're just already

414
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,760
attracting these types of students so

415
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,440
is it because of our program or were

416
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
they already destined to end up there

417
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,240
anyway

418
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,959
so we asked how much did cyber patriot

419
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,600
affect

420
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,800
your decision to pursue stem

421
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,920
in college or stem career 85

422
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
said that cyber patriot had a positive

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,760
impact on their decision to pursue stem

424
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,320
so um i guess that goes to show the

425
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,360
program is

426
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,839
is working and we're happy to see that

427
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,760
so not only do we have a program in the

428
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,360
united states

429
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,920
but we also have a couple international

430
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,959
spin-offs

431
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,720
and these have come from the request of

432
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,079
northrop grumman

433
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,199
who is our presenting sponsor and it

434
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,800
basically helps them

435
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,720
establish leadership roles in cyber

436
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,600
workforce development in each country

437
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,680
so the star pitcher staff supports each

438
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,240
of these events in some capacity

439
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,279
and northrop grumman does cover

440
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,920
our costs that are associated with these

441
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,240
international programs

442
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,279
so the first is cyber centurion was

443
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,519
established in 2014 and it takes place

444
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,800
in the uk so each year students

445
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,079
from great britain compete in a very

446
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,720
similar competition

447
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,279
just like cyberpatriot and they host

448
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,040
their national finals in london and we

449
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,440
offer

450
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,639
technical support at that event we also

451
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,120
have helped out with a program called

452
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,639
cyber arabia which

453
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,040
started in 2015 in saudi arabia

454
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,399
and that's a little different it's not a

455
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,639
competition it's more of a workshop

456
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,120
where our staff members travel over

457
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,759
there

458
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,079
to teach on the men's and women's

459
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,360
campuses

460
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,639
of king syud university so the morning

461
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,800
is instruction and then the afternoon of

462
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
the workshop is a miniature competition

463
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,079
and cash prizes are awarded to the top

464
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:58,800
winners

465
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,079
between the two campuses

466
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,600
cyber titan is a canadian initiative

467
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,399
established in 2016. these students

468
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,600
actually kind of compete in two

469
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
competitions

470
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
cyber titan teams compete as part of the

471
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,800
normal cyber patriot season

472
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,160
and are scored against all the other

473
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,079
cyber patriot teams so they are able to

474
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,880
qualify for

475
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
the cyber patriot national finals but

476
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,959
they also then have their own standalone

477
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
cyber titan finals with just the top 10

478
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,639
scoring teams within canada

479
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
so they each year usually have over 200

480
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,560
teams participating and they hold their

481
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,839
national finals in ottawa

482
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,800
and then lastly we have cyber taipan

483
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
which was established in 2018

484
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,880
and that's the australian version of

485
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,079
cyberpatriot

486
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,880
another northrop grumman initiative and

487
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
it's held

488
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,360
with the support of commonwealth

489
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,120
scientific and industrial research

490
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
organization

491
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
the competition has been adjusted to

492
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,639
match their school year

493
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,800
because the school year in australia is

494
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,480
quite different than the school year

495
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,199
in the us and they have their national

496
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,640
finals competition

497
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,959
in the nation's capital which cyber

498
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,079
patriot staff

499
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,160
also offer support at

500
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,240
with all of these programs whether it's

501
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,160
cyberpatriot or any of the international

502
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,959
spin-offs

503
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,039
we really have a big push for female and

504
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,880
minority outreach

505
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,679
like i mentioned we do waive fees for

506
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,679
all girl teams

507
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,280
in the most recent season the 2019-2020

508
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,880
season we had

509
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,320
almost 350 all-girl teams registered

510
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
we've also had a couple all-girls teams

511
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,240
qualify for national finals

512
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,039
which is really exciting for them and it

513
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,919
and it really

514
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,400
i think encourages other girls to join

515
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,919
the program

516
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,679
there's also been you know plenty of

517
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,960
female only sessions for afa cyber camps

518
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,400
and we always try to highlight you know

519
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
young women who are in cyber patriot in

520
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,280
our promotional materials in our

521
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,320
newsletter

522
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
um you know anywhere we can so that

523
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
other girls can see okay

524
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,559
you know there there are other girls

525
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,640
competing you know why can't i

526
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
so we're at about 31 female

527
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,080
participation

528
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,600
which is over double the average for

529
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,799
female participation in stem programs

530
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,799
same with minority outreach we're always

531
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,000
i'm trying to

532
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,440
you know push strong recruitment in

533
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,160
urban areas and engage with

534
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
you know certain youth organizations

535
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
like boys and girls clubs of america

536
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,120
code 2040 nsbe um

537
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,160
and the ideas you know improved minority

538
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,520
student recruitment

539
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,799
and also mentoring we have a strong

540
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,679
presence

541
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,559
in los angeles unified school district

542
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,600
as well as

543
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,320
san antonio texas so that um

544
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,919
you know there's a large minority

545
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,160
population there so so that's good we're

546
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
able to reach them

547
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,880
we're at about 48 minority participation

548
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,840
in the competition

549
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,200
so it's pretty clear how a student can

550
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,000
be involved

551
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
in the competition but let's talk about

552
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
engagement opportunities for

553
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,919
for other individuals if you're a

554
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,720
college student

555
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,559
if you know you're a cyber security

556
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,240
professional if you're a teacher here's

557
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,520
how you can get involved

558
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,480
you can register as a team coach or if

559
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,919
you're you know tech savvy enough you

560
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
can register as a technical mentor

561
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,320
to be a coach you don't really have to

562
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
have any technical knowledge

563
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,840
you're just really giving students the

564
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,080
opportunity to participate

565
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
the technical mentor is the one who

566
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,440
really comes in

567
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
and helps with teaching the technical

568
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,600
concepts these individuals because

569
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,039
they're not usually tied to a school do

570
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,960
need to go through background check

571
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,320
before they are you know part of the

572
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,720
database that coaches can access

573
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,200
to find a mentor in their area if you

574
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
don't want to really volunteer in one of

575
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,600
those

576
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,919
roles you can you know sponsor a team in

577
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,200
your area you can

578
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
fund the registration fees or donate

579
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,320
equipment or you know

580
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,400
offer a space where they can compete if

581
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,679
they don't have

582
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,720
you know a usable space and

583
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,960
and just even more simple than that you

584
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,039
can promote the competition to local

585
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,840
schools

586
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,960
you know spread the word or attend

587
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
the national finals competition

588
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,559
hopefully we can have it in person

589
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,000
in 2021 but really just supporting

590
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,760
those students who are involved

591
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
a little more information on technical

592
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,320
mentor and team assistant

593
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
the technical mentors are um there to

594
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,000
teach the competitors the skills they

595
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,840
need for the competition

596
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
some technical mentors are really

597
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
experts in in one specific topic whether

598
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,039
it's windows

599
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,240
linux cisco networking

600
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,320
but really coaches will take any help

601
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,679
that they can get from a technical

602
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,840
mentor we have coaches who are

603
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,799
english teachers or music teachers and

604
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,080
they've only signed up

605
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,760
because they wanted to give kids the

606
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,520
opportunity to participate but they're

607
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,159
like i don't

608
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,840
know how to teach this stuff so that's

609
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
where technical mentors really come into

610
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,159
play

611
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,760
and you can offer as little or as much

612
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,919
time as you want um with the team

613
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
that's a relationship that you make with

614
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,960
the coach and you guys work out your

615
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,320
schedules

616
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,760
as you wish um team assistant is a

617
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
role where you don't actually need

618
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,200
technical skills but you still want to

619
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
help out with the team so

620
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,559
it's more administrative you can you

621
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,440
know

622
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,559
schedule meetings or arrange for pizza

623
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,000
to be delivered during a competition

624
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,919
whatever it is the time commitment on

625
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,400
either roll is very flexible

626
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
and again teams just really like having

627
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,799
any help that they can get so that is

628
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,679
the competition and if you have any

629
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,159
questions feel free to reach out to us

630
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,320
one of our staff members can help i'm

631
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,520
going to turn it over to

632
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,080
rachel zimmerman now and she'll talk

633
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,520
about

634
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,960
the other programs that we offer

635
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,559
now that you've learned more about the

636
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,480
competition let's start to cover

637
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,320
some of the other programs the cyber

638
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,039
patriot has starting with the afa cyber

639
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
camp program

640
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,039
afa cyber camps are 20 hours of

641
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:27,679
curriculum

642
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,320
that organizations can purchase and then

643
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,159
host camps locally

644
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,400
they are available in both standard for

645
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,440
beginners

646
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,679
and advanced for students who have prior

647
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,440
knowledge of cyber security

648
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,280
or for students who have previously

649
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,440
competed in cyber patriot

650
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,679
the camps are designed to be given over

651
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,320
five four-hour days

652
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,520
we were able to hold over 300 camps in

653
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,320
the summer of

654
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,280
2020 despite the complications of kobe

655
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,080
19

656
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,640
and many camps needing to cancel and the

657
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,880
remainder of camps needing to go virtual

658
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,080
this slide shows what is covered in each

659
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,360
of the camps

660
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,000
also included in the camp curriculum is

661
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,320
demonstration images where the students

662
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,120
get hands

663
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,840
on time to execute the things and the

664
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,159
concepts that they are learning about

665
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,240
the last day of the camp is a mini

666
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,080
cyberpatriot competition where

667
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
students get to put forth the knowledge

668
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,120
that they've learned

669
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,840
throughout the camp camp registration is

670
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
open from february 1st

671
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,400
through may 1st

672
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
there are many ways to become involved

673
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,159
in afa cyber camps

674
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,720
you can host a camp in your local area

675
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
or volunteer as a camp instructor or

676
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,159
classroom assistant

677
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,480
you can also financially support a camp

678
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,799
by covering their registration fee

679
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,919
or by donating equipment or facility to

680
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,120
a camp

681
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
many camps also are looking for guest

682
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,640
speakers

683

target senior citizens

745

776
