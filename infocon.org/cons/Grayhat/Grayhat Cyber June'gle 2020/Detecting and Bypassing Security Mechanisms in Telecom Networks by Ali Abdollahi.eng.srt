1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,799
hello my wonderful people hope you are

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:15,690
great and safe today I intend to talk

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,880
about something new and rare in field of

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,550
a telecom hacking so it's really really

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,939
hard for security experts

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,100
telecommunication engineers and mobile

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,850
operators to deal with signaling and

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,600
telco attacks why it's hard because

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,690
telco networks are complex and includes

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,949
many segments like radio signaling IP

11
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,829
backbones IT packets

12
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,989
packet data actually etc and in this

13
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,080
talk I don't want to talk about basics

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,350
and traditional tanks I just want to

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,830
lose straight how we can break into a

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,270
hardened telecom infrastructure why they

17
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,750
are using security devices and security

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,439
mechanism if you are ready let's get

19
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,770
into

20
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,540
first of all I want to introduce myself

21
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,970
I'm Ally cyber security researcher

22
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,329
focusing on all aspects of offensive for

23
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,360
more than eight years on author of books

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,280
and articles as well

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,020
I'm a regular speaker and trainer at

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,990
international conferences holding master

27
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,970
of computer science and many

28
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:02,340
international certificates okay

29
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,670
as you can see according to the news and

30
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,500
this is slide many frauds other types of

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,049
cyber incidents have occurred in past

32
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,670
several years while they are abusing

33
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,209
telecommunication and mobile

34
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:24,099
infrastructure in top left corner you

35
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,640
can see that mal factors exploit ss7

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,080
network to inject am average attack on

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,620
financial companies and banks in other

38
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,900
news on the left side you can see that

39
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,359
hackers targeted UK Metro Bank through

40
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:49,319
ss7 which is the ss7 is one of the main

41
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,959
signaling protocol or to stand for

42
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,100
signalling system number seven and play

43
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,000
a critical role in telecommunication and

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,889
actually traditional threat to the

45
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:09,190
communication infrastructure okay and on

46
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,579
right side there is a news regarding two

47
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,769
vulnerabilities in mobile networks in

48
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:17,579
the United States

49
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,180
in this slide I've divided all possible

50
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,470
attacks and vulnerabilities in Telecom

51
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:37,500
first is a subscriber profile data

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,310
leakage a subscriber data leakage the

53
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,790
second one is Network data leakage or

54
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,620
maybe mobile node data leakage third one

55
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,200
is tracking mobile subscribers and

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,040
breaking to privacy the next one is

57
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,730
sniffing spoofing fraud like

58
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,739
transferring money um using SSU SST

59
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,609
operations or making free or cheap coal

60
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,858
for example you may make a call to

61
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,880
another country why you are paying for

62
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,990
the call like an internal one or maybe a

63
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:34,349
call to your current country so okay for

64
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,960
those who has not enough background of

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,370
telecommunication and mobile network

66
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,430
here is the architecture of a mobile

67
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,360
operator each mobile network operator or

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,720
MN o has three main segments includes

69
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,710
radio access network or ran which

70
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,220
responsible for all radio and baseband

71
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,720
communications like your connectivity

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,660
from your handset or mobile phone to the

73
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,039
tower the next one is circuits which

74
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,490
network or CS network CS core network

75
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,750
handles your voice and SMS something

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,900
like that and the third segment is

77
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,770
packet network or PS packet switch

78
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,130
network which is responsible to bring

79
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,570
your internet connection

80
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,940
okay in this slide I'm going to talk

81
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,840
about security mekinese mean radio

82
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,570
access network cell ran mostly there are

83
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,870
three types of security mechanism in

84
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,830
radio access network first is phone

85
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,240
registration or any type of policy for

86
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,479
your hardware and IMEI which is a unique

87
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,500
code for mobile hardware second is

88
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,680
enabling ciphering algorithm to fight

89
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,760
against interception and

90
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,479
man-in-the-middle attack or mi TM third

91
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,290
item is using only empty and LTE

92
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,380
advanced infrastructure instead of

93
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,800
traditional mobile core networks in 2g

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:48,160
and 3G so now we want to review the

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,039
high-level architecture of radio access

96
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,030
networks in radio access network we have

97
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,870
cell tower maybe you know BTS into G

98
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,550
node B in 3G and in order to be in 4G or

99
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,200
evolve node V into 4G or LTE you can see

100
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,830
that in nodes B is passing pure traffic

101
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,250
to PS packet switch and circuit switch

102
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,010
networks based on the traffic type okay

103
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,050
it means that if you want to connect to

104
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,690
the internet your traffic will go

105
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,389
through PS network or packet switch

106
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,300
network and if you want to make a call

107
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,039
or maybe it send a SMS that the traffic

108
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,680
will go through CS

109
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:56,539
or circuits each network okay so by

110
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:01,850
using IMEI policy so the answer is to

111
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:08,479
fight against phone smuggling and maybe

112
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,830
some lawful and security monitoring

113
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,460
tracking and locating stolen devices and

114
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:26,770
criminals okay now with the help of a

115
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:34,520
phone like Motorola c11 5 + 1 1 8 and

116
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,279
osmocon BB software we can set an

117
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,229
invalid or fake or even duplicate IMEI

118
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,170
and set up a code to test network

119
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,270
reactions as you can see in this

120
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,140
screenshot here network sense identity

121
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,020
request to my phone and the type of

122
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:07,850
identity was IMEI here's the a

123
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,800
screenshot you can see the type of ID

124
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,040
identity is IMEI so I should reply with

125
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:29,750
a valid IMEI number so in this slide as

126
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,350
you can see I replied to request using

127
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:44,149
an invalid IMEI said to all 0 that's I

128
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:52,040
think that's cool and so the network

129
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,930
accepted my invalid IMEI because

130
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,999
ciphering procedures

131
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:03,290
completed as you can see

132
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,470
okay there are sometimes ciphering keys

133
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:23,730
like kc s res and randall random number

134
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,730
in radio access network which Hardin

135
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,880
radio network to avoid active sniffing

136
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,140
and they always store in home location

137
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:44,240
register or HL r or HSS in core network

138
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,189
you

139
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,570
actually HSS or HL are as subscriber

140
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:04,910
database as a component call a UC or

141
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,170
authentication Center which is

142
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,840
responsible for cycling and

143
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,670
authentication procedures to bypass and

144
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,660
get these information we are going to

145
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:27,300
targeting a you see in HLR HSS by please

146
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,230
note that when I'm talking about HL are

147
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,680
McQueen's traditional node in for

148
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,060
example 2g GSM or even UMTS and when

149
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,560
whenever I am talking about HSS exactly

150
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:53,550
like as HL are just as a in coordinate

151
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,700
walk when we are going to talk about LTE

152
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:03,150
or even 3G actually we are going to

153
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,260
targeting a you see in HLR HSS by

154
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,530
abusing SS 7 and signaling access as a

155
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:19,670
roaming partner ok as you can see here I

156
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,780
sent malicious ss7 mat or mobile

157
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,730
application part sa I or send

158
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,280
authentication info to targeted core

159
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,880
network from SS 7 network to retrieve

160
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,230
sign Frank information and the network

161
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,590
respond me while random number

162
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,570
Astra's and KC values in clear text it's

163
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,200
really cool

164
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,519
okay another security mechanism is using

165
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,760
LTE only LTE LTE advanced to bring

166
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:13,949
highest quality and performance having

167
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:18,690
more security and privacy in core and

168
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,190
radius segments and other factors like

169
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,339
voiceover LTE or volte flexibility and

170
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:36,110
many others okay guys let's review

171
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,990
bypassing method in this slide

172
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:46,220
totally there is a one general way and

173
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,240
that's downgrading subscribers to

174
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,570
traditional technologies like 3G and 2g

175
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,570
which are wonderful to perform than

176
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,089
grading we need to use a signal jammer

177
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,329
okay

178
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:11,670
security in circuits which network or

179
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,800
seus Coronet Ward first thing is using

180
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,180
SMS home routing and the second

181
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,310
mechanism is zip using signaling

182
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:34,560
firewalls okay cool home routine act as

183
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,180
a proxy and the definition of a home

184
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,470
router is to hiding subscriber MC which

185
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,100
is a very very valuable information to

186
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,149
perform hacking scenarios from hacker

187
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:56,399
science as you can see a hacker request

188
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:03,449
to receive MC from HLR HSS and the agile

189
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,879
RHS is respond with real value

190
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,110
however home router changed the value

191
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,399
with a fake one

192
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,910
okay first things from a hacker point of

193
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,870
view is how we can detect if home

194
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,939
routing is enable or not just we need to

195
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:38,329
send two or more malicious

196
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:48,040
ss7 message like send routing info and

197
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,839
even send routing info for SM if we

198
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,870
received different responses it means

199
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:03,170
that SMS home routing is in place as you

200
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:12,860
can see we have two different attempts

201
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,600
here in first one hacker try to send a

202
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,819
malicious sa-7 request to the core

203
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:28,879
network and the core network respond SMS

204
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,540
router respond with a number so hacker

205
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:38,180
retrieved a number as MZ in second

206
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,519
scenario and in second attempt hacker

207
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,360
resent the same message to request the

208
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,379
MZ so as a true result hacker

209
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:59,839
must retrieve a same same value of MC

210
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,069
however as you can see the numbers are

211
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:08,859
different so the hacker received

212
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:13,520
different numbers as MZ so in this case

213
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,189
SMS home routing is in place

214
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:34,140
ok let's go deeper to bypass this

215
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,670
security mechons in telecommunication

216
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,620
networks or mobile networks we have

217
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,740
three types of GTS or global title which

218
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:53,600
act as IP address ok MSISDN consists of

219
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:03,409
mcc or mobile country code NDC and s n

220
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,830
MC consists of MCC mobile country code

221
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,230
MNC or mobile network code which

222
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,250
indicates your mobile operator code ok

223
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:23,820
and MSI n which is a unique number MGT

224
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,080
consists of MCC mobile country code NDC

225
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,730
and MSI n as you can see hacker can

226
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,500
abuse MGT number and a valid random MC

227
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,640
number to request other information

228
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,620
regarding to targeted mobile number or

229
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:51,780
MSS the N and it's real MC so according

230
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:58,320
to the picture here Hank here try to

231
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,680
send malicious as a seven message to the

232
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,990
cornet board using MGT and hacker guess

233
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,200
a random MC located in Tonga that HLR

234
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,650
HSS is it's easy to use because for

235
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,700
example a hacker could take advantage

236
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,750
from a known MC like for example my MC I

237
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,710
know mine see there are many many

238
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,810
different applications that you can try

239
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,680
to retrieve your MZ or even or some

240
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,320
online and offline databases on the

241
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,290
Internet

242
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:45,910
and again like previous slides core

243
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:52,170
networks and actually notes in cornet or

244
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,950
replied with real values however SMS

245
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:03,160
home router replied the actual number

246
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,240
plus MSC address because hacker

247
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,150
guess an MC which is valid for the

248
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:19,590
operator mobile operator with MGT number

249
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,670
okay so the next security mechanism is

250
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,520
signaling firewall mobile operators use

251
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,050
actual signaling firewalls to protect

252
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,430
their signaling infrastructure or

253
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:45,300
circuit-switched Network signal packet

254
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,280
inspection filtering wide and

255
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,220
blacklisting or main feature of a

256
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:03,070
signaling firewall so how we can bypass

257
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:10,180
it to bypass these kind of foibles we

258
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:17,380
need just to playing with T cap okay

259
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:24,490
what is T cap T cap or transaction

260
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:30,100
capabilities application part is ss7 sub

261
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,450
protocol and it's like TCP T cap enables

262
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,950
the deployment of advanced intelligent

263
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,210
network services by supporting non

264
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,910
circuit related information exchange

265
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,280
between signaling points using

266
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,540
sccp or signalling connection control

267
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,970
part which is connectionless service and

268
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,430
tika provides the framework to retrieve

269
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,450
information or even in book remote

270
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,770
operations TCAP offers the means for end

271
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,220
users in the ss7 network to query

272
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,300
another end office and acts as the

273
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,240
software interface between and ss7

274
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,100
office and database services in order to

275
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,560
actually obtain data from the ss7

276
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:41,390
network okay well to perform bypassing

277
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,960
we need to remove application context

278
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,300
name from TCAP or the next way is

279
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,120
sending double operation message so I

280
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,730
want to foster it what is application

281
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,160
context then the application context

282
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,550
name or ACN is used for all supported

283
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,380
itu-t cap message except abort message

284
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,020
no attempts to retrieve the ACN is made

285
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,370
for abort messages all other supported

286
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,870
messages may have a dialog portion kind

287
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,840
containing dialogue request or

288
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,670
unidirectional dialogue dial-up responds

289
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,030
PDU from which the ASN is retrieved if

290
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,120
no no dialect portion is detected then

291
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,230
the ACN Assam to be not the T cap up

292
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,900
code based routing feature attempts to

293
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,500
find the operation code or up code in

294
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,820
all supported ITT cab misses except

295
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,030
abort these messages must contain in

296
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,640
work or return results last or not last

297
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,270
as the first component if not the opcode

298
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:09,640
is a sum to be not okay

299
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,420
removing application context name from

300
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,780
ticket method to start the procedure we

301
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,080
need to remove dialogue request section

302
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,790
from our malicious ss7 message before

303
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:36,580
send to core network then the real not

304
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,570
application context name to point to

305
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:45,570
malicious ss7 map message directly

306
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:53,680
according to the picture you can see the

307
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,640
hacker is trying to send a normal ss7

308
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:08,020
message without dialogue which means the

309
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,740
hacker removed dialogue request from ss7

310
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,960
message plus in addition actually the

311
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,820
hanker puts malicious message opcode

312
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:28,600
inside the whole ss7 message so as a

313
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,090
result CS correspond to normal message

314
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,480
in addition malicious message so a

315
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,140
hacker retrieved all information that he

316
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:50,400
or she want to have in this case okay

317
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,400
sending double operation message most of

318
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,410
signaling firewall block or accept a

319
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,890
message based on message type so each

320
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,400
signalling message has its own operation

321
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,350
code or opcode that I mentioned before

322
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:13,110
and it's a vital number

323
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:19,029
in this code in this sorry in this

324
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:24,909
picture you can see that the opcode of

325
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:28,270
Centro berlín info for SMS ID for sm is

326
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:39,940
45 in this scenario as you can see here

327
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:48,890
hacker is trying to put a legitimate ss7

328
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,370
map message operation code in the first

329
00:26:52,370 --> 00:27:04,669
step and then hacker put up malicious

330
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:09,320
ss7 map message so signaling firewall

331
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,669
will check just the first operation code

332
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:17,149
which is pointing to legitimate

333
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:24,380
operation and pass through to network or

334
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,330
network and can address malicious

335
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,899
operation in addition legitimate ss7 map

336
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:36,380
message and Malchus map message as a

337
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:44,210
result HLR HSS responds with some kind

338
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,690
of error because it can't understand

339
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:56,659
what we are looking for so signaling for

340
00:27:56,659 --> 00:28:03,020
evil will keep the whole session to get

341
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:15,049
back any legitimate ss7 message so the

342
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,350
hacker

343
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,639
we'll try to retrieve and request

344
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:31,659
actually everything that's valuable for

345
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:37,149
it because the whole session stablish

346
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:41,489
and signalling firewall is keeping game

347
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:44,830
so the hacker would take advantage from

348
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:52,929
this actually session and so signalling

349
00:28:52,929 --> 00:29:00,190
firewall trade like the previous one

350
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,719
because signalling fire will keep the

351
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:08,679
whole session and this session is

352
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:16,779
legitimate so as a result core network

353
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:19,839
respond with all information regarding

354
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:26,200
to for example subscriber MC and network

355
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,950
information that hacker requested

356
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:41,710
solutions actually first an important

357
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,989
thing is hardening the devices protocols

358
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:51,849
and communications based on industry

359
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:57,879
standards like 3gpp Etsy etc most of

360
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,159
related world abilities can be patched

361
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,399
using hardening and security audit

362
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:09,700
second one is using firewall or if you

363
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,940
are using signaling firewall already you

364
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:20,169
can find Hyun and optimize it at e o TS

365
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:24,009
OCT sock or telecom security operations

366
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:28,210
center is highly recommended like IT and

367
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,509
IP backbones which need to have

368
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:32,850
real-time secure

369
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:37,590
to monitoring telecom network need to

370
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:46,590
have something like that periodic

371
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,300
assessments and audit are necessary and

372
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,980
finally training and security awareness

373
00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:00,300
are very useful thank you guys for your

374
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,420
attention you can stay in touch with me

375
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,830
sharing experiences knowledge together

376
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,490
finding more friends and please stay

377
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:17,150
safe and healthy and thank you

378
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:22,410
organizer for organizing such a great

379
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,770
event
