1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:12,699
[Music]

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,369
hey and welcome to our talk on read

3
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,619
sourcing cyber operations on a budget

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,230
because not all developing countries

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,230
need to be developing countries I'm uh

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,660
I'm Nick carp and I'm Christopher glare

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:33,110
and yeah we're formerly of the podcast

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,890
series a state of the hack and yeah

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,290
we're here to give this talk in and

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,370
we'll get we'll get right into it we

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,590
actually gave a lightning talk version

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,050
of this that was about a ten minute talk

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,080
at cyberwar con and doesn't follow up

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,690
and I've talked about it a bit on that

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,570
on the state of the heck show and we've

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,490
expanded on it today and want to share

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,440
some new thoughts on it but the basic

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,520
idea is that read sourcing is our term

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,810
for outsourcing these apt and financial

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,200
attackers outsourcing their development

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,729
for sort of resource efficiency and

22
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:14,320
evasion to read teams and Red Team tools

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,850
and yeah let's uh Oh an important part I

24
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,469
think we have it on the next slide here

25
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:24,469
is that we developed a lot of this at

26
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:29,420
fireEye and we got their approval to

27
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,159
present for everyone here today

28
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,109
so both both Chris and I are now at

29
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,869
Microsoft working in cloud security and

30
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:40,490
yeah so thanks to the fireEye crew for

31
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,600
letting us bring this back so you know

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,060
some part of my background you know I

33
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,520
was an economics minor in college and

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,859
you know Nick and i's we were you know

35
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:54,439
seeing kind of different trends over

36
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,479
several years we had kind of different

37
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,209
ways that we want to try and you know

38
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:01,819
highlight it or bring it up and so you

39
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,289
know we had like a you know magic

40
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,880
quadrant style and like all these

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,340
different ones that we thought you know

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,410
but then do they what what we found was

43
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,030
useful in kind of describing what you

44
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,260
know that so the trends I've seen over

45
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,080
the last decade was actually a supply

46
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,049
curve and so you know when you look at

47
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:18,920
like the definition of

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,780
source efficiency it's about how do you

49
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,300
minimize wasted resources and expenses

50
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,180
and so when we think about that from

51
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,400
like a cyber operations perspective you

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,590
know if you look at like the cost on the

53
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,230
vertical access and so for for you know

54
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,569
more resources and that could be you

55
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:40,819
know time and/or money or personnel for

56
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,260
more cost than more effort that you put

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,910
into that you'll get some amount of

58
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,250
additional capability but over time that

59
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,590
capability you'll have diminishing

60
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,900
returns on that capability and so we

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,850
thought it was useful to kind of frame

62
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,459
cyber operations in this and then start

63
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,080
actually comparing how this has changed

64
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,780
over time so I kind of want to like take

65
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,819
step back because you know but many

66
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,260
people here this conference may not be

67
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,900
aware of what intrusions were like and

68
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,959
say the early 2010's but it looked very

69
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,519
different than than it does today so

70
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,500
there were you know I came full of

71
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,970
financial threat actors maybe two or

72
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,890
three they were doing really the

73
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,930
targeted intrusions the that were doing

74
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,600
card data theft or large-scale ACH

75
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,760
transfer you had a handful of

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,530
nation-states they may have had several

77
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,060
intrusion groups under that but a

78
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,709
limited number of nation states that

79
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,859
were targeting organizations and so as

80
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:35,840
you transition from the kind of 2000 or

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,579
is mostly government and defense

82
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:40,370
industrial base to the kind of dawn of

83
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,760
the 2010s it started expanding as you

84
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,500
know China in particular started getting

85
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,160
more focused on intellectual property

86
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,980
and you know technology transfers so

87
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,269
they started you know you have like

88
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,239
operational rora in 2010 you have large

89
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,950
multi national organizations that are

90
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,470
being targeted so it's still a fairly

91
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,890
you know defined list of organizations

92
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,230
and size and and if you're not in one of

93
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,750
those your general risk of having like a

94
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,720
major you know catastrophic cyber

95
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,769
incident that would cost your

96
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:15,769
organization money or you know trade

97
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,478
secrets or something else's was probably

98
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:20,630
fairly low the thing that you know from

99
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,738
from the threat actors that we

100
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:23,750
investigated in that time frame the

101
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,370
majority of the tools that they

102
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,280
leveraged were custom tools so I'm I'm

103
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,229
kind of thinking of you know what ap one

104
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,669
looked like or what apt three looked

105
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:32,630
like

106
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,690
in the 2010-2011 timeframe there it gets

107
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,150
important a context to glider I don't

108
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,880
know if people you know we jumped right

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,380
through and didn't go through a detailed

110
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,210
background or anything but but both of

111
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,160
us have spent over a decade in incident

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
response so this presentation and what

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,890
we've been seeing in in that time period

114
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,570
is just our personal experiences for

115
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,310
these different attackers so we're we've

116
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:01,010
kind of experienced a market change so

117
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,870
what we wanted to highlight and kind of

118
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,550
setting the stage there is that if you

119
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,260
look at you know a decade plus ago to

120
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,410
now we see that there are you know more

121
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,480
threat actors and collectively with more

122
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,100
capability now I think some of that is

123
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,680
inevitable just because of the

124
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,310
especially from an agency perspective

125
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,530
the the amount of benefit that you can

126
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,600
gain from from connecting cyber

127
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,570
operations is you know so high relative

128
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,760
to the cost so that I think that we were

129
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,220
bound to see that happen but we

130
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,810
definitely see worse outcomes today than

131
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,240
a decade ago in terms of you know more

132
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,790
victims larger impacted victims

133
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,650
especially with the kind of the trend

134
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,820
over the last year or two of enterprise

135
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,070
ransomware and you know part of what

136
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,630
we've seen there is that it cost

137
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,100
significantly less to develop an entry

138
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,840
level computer network operations

139
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,530
program and and you know both the the

140
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,420
location of the curve as well as the

141
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,550
shape of this kind of supply curve as

142
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,180
we've deemed it you can for the same

143
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,520
capability spent say you know ten years

144
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,870
ago you can get either significantly

145
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,660
more capability or but also the barrier

146
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,600
to entry is lower for maybe groups or

147
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,890
teams or operators or their for their

148
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,450
financial a nation-state who maybe

149
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,490
couldn't you know couldn't operate

150
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,080
profitably you say in the financial side

151
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,170
um who now can today and so you have

152
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,490
more that's part of the why you have

153
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,420
more threat actors as well

154
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,430
so take us back as you know many of you

155
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,950
may be familiar with kind of the ap11

156
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,570
report you know I I personally

157
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,300
investigate a bunch of the apt one

158
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,000
intrusions but if you look at you know

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,450
they were everywhere at that time so on

160
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,770
this graph kind of what we've done is

161
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,470
we've highlighted in kind of a Baloo the

162
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,130
tooling that was created by there were

163
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,830
custom tools so apt one you know they

164
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,450
used a couple of different kind of I

165
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,720
would say criminal underground or you

166
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,330
know hacker underground with backdoors

167
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,610
like poison ivy and ghost rat and then a

168
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,730
tunneling tool called a trim they'll

169
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,610
ever primarily read source the password

170
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,540
numbers and and you know the mini cats

171
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,870
of the world and others like that but

172
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,340
they they really spend a lot of time on

173
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,050
kind of custom tooling so a couple that

174
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,430
you know stand out to me part of where

175
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,980
they get their name in in the industry

176
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,650
is like comic crew was their web see two

177
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,840
back doors that instead of using

178
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,800
encryption like an SSL cert or key they

179
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,660
would do their like an encoding scheme

180
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,130
like a Caesar cipher or something else

181
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,320
so whenever their commanding control you

182
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,230
know backdoor would communicate out it

183
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,210
would then you know rearrange the the

184
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,880
order of the the comes and they had a

185
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,530
variety of those that they rolled

186
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,140
through over the years it's not fun as

187
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,600
we're looking back at this too and for

188
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,770
anyone that wants to take a look and

189
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,120
learn more about some of these if you

190
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,740
haven't seen it it still holds up

191
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,840
but apt one report actually had a

192
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,150
malware appendix that we really learned

193
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,580
is a little bit hard to find with a lot

194
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,810
of technical details freaks these

195
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,570
malware families but it's kind of cool

196
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,670
too because we're big fans of legit

197
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,490
services c2 and Claridon if there's

198
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,060
anyone who to highlight there that I

199
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,770
think the calendar one was neat yes I

200
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,290
went through and reread the entire this

201
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,480
past week kind of relent through and

202
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,920
read the entire you know malware

203
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,630
appendix and there are a couple that

204
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,860
actually stood out to me so in kind of

205
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,020
the upper right of the the quadrant the

206
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,170
Gluck's mail macro mail and calendar

207
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,760
more interesting because they were maybe

208
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,740
one of the first or earlier groups that

209
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,419
were doing legit you know using

210
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,770
legitimate services for commanding

211
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,360
control whether that was

212
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,590
one of them was that kind of kind of a

213
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,530
jabber communications protocol back door

214
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,940
another one communicated with the

215
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,280
calendar one communicate with the Google

216
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,760
Google Calendar API for comms

217
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,980
g-dog upload was entering so that when

218
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,530
they wanted to do data theft at least at

219
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,310
certain organizations later in you know

220
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,470
as they as they matured over time they

221
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,430
had like kind of a Google Docs API

222
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,550
uploader

223
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,620
where they could you know send large

224
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,810
volumes of data to Google Documents

225
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,170
on the bottom left actually you know to

226
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,760
the onesie they were kind of ensuring

227
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,640
we're you know we would come in and they

228
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,720
would have like a very consistent

229
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,180
pattern with which they would steal say

230
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,160
emails from organizations email was a

231
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,660
really large thing that they were

232
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,650
targeting because they were trying to

233
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,200
get you know communications about you

234
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,490
know company a was looking to acquire

235
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,770
Company B that was it was in China or

236
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,840
vice versa and they wouldn't understand

237
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
you know the negotiating strategy or

238
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,410
their their bid position etc so you

239
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,930
needed to monitor the you know the email

240
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,940
communications of those users and so in

241
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,830
the bottom left that map you can get

242
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,210
mail or two different ways they did that

243
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,810
using the mapping protocol so you know a

244
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,840
pretty ensuring and then when you

245
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,490
actually then they're actually a whole

246
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,110
bunch of other backdoors I mean just you

247
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,910
know this is obviously their operations

248
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,130
over the course of a seven year period

249
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,350
but they just rolled through you know

250
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,360
tons of you know a variety of different

251
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,300
custom back doors that they leverage so

252
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,160
those are its kind of some of the the

253
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,020
takeaways that I took from this week for

254
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,020
rereading that that were yeah and just

255
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,460
one of the themes throughout the

256
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,020
presentation that we hope you pick up

257
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,270
it's just what they like fingerprint of

258
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,600
this attacker looks like and will circle

259
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,240
up with some more specifics on

260
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,950
attribution in different groups but this

261
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,520
has a certain way that this looks in

262
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,950
addition to all of the the adversary

263
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,660
costs that has gone into building their

264
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,820
capability well you know I think the

265
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,770
other piece on that side

266
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,150
you know when apt one would be an

267
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,240
environment it would be very common for

268
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,220
you to find the same say you know either

269
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,250
hash or you know kind of control I say

270
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,260
either IP or domain used in multiple

271
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,960
environments they would deploy you know

272
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,529
say 30

273
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,209
backdoors in environment with a variety

274
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,540
of different on a variety of different

275
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,180
systems some servers and workstations

276
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,439
some different families in that way if

277
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:03,480
you caught a particular class of them or

278
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,730
found something on IP address they would

279
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,139
they could still maintain access to that

280
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,050
environment but they that you know their

281
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,059
operational security you know they

282
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,949
weren't getting caught a whole lot and

283
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:16,709
so they didn't need really extreme or

284
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,149
advanced operational security because

285
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:26,550
what they were doing worked cool so

286
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,620
let's get into apt 32 a little bit jump

287
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,329
all the way forward but it's still a

288
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:37,499
story of a state-sponsored program that

289
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:42,329
it was building to start spreading out

290
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,089
the the reach of their cyber operations

291
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:48,329
and specifically the cross section we're

292
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:50,160
going to look at is when apt 32 also

293
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,319
known as ocean Lotus and several other

294
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:55,439
things we're gonna take a look at when

295
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:57,809
they really started apt one style

296
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,490
targeting private corporations and

297
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,790
broadening their up broadening what they

298
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,740
were conducting so one of the

299
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,089
interesting things about apt 32 is that

300
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,750
they use read sourcing early to expand

301
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,459
their their operations they use that

302
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,189
time that they saved that cost that they

303
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:25,470
save to expand and and take on sorry to

304
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,779
take on new mission space so apt 32 is

305
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,410
primarily law enforcement in Vietnam and

306
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,519
there are law enforcement agency and by

307
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,259
using read sourcing and seeing the

308
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,079
successes there they started to expand

309
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,910
from domestic issues you know focusing

310
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,429
on law enforcement but then their

311
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,629
definition of law enforcement which is

312
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:50,249
tracking journalists and monitoring

313
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,939
citizens to conducting these full-on

314
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,879
intrusions and private corporations

315
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,439
think here it nicely called it corporate

316
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:00,809
compliance and oversight but you can

317
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:04,379
imagine making sure the it's like a

318
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,000
funny making

319
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,200
yeah exactly just other companies yes

320
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,570
making sure companies understand that

321
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,400
and are complying with the law it was

322
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,870
their definition of law enforcement as

323
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,210
well but to us it looked like intrusions

324
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,700
into private corporations to read their

325
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,140
email and then some other spy stuff

326
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,490
there's some pretty cool stuff there

327
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,810
acquire I don't know if there's if we

328
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,820
have the little snapshot of some of the

329
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,460
things a PT 32 has done they're much

330
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,290
more involved in the in Asia and

331
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,820
focusing on some of the some of their

332
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,640
region Southeast Asia but there's some

333
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,050
cool they're actually connected to a lot

334
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,010
of bigger stories if anyone remembers

335
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,100
although now maybe it's less odd to see

336
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,870
you know the the President may be saying

337
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,640
something inappropriate I remember a

338
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,340
long time ago there's a stolen Trump and

339
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,650
Duterte classified transcript where they

340
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,980
were talking about North Korea and it

341
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,260
was a document that was actually taken

342
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,010
from President dieter Ches office in the

343
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,860
Philippines and so it it turned out as

344
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,160
explored in this in this article by

345
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,390
crisping it turned out that the actual

346
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,630
transcript was taken from by apt 32 from

347
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,700
the Philippine executive office of the

348
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,500
president and it got out in this kind of

349
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,850
weird way where they accidentally

350
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,260
uploaded it to virustotal

351
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,839
but anyways it's they started really

352
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,810
expanding and having this these massive

353
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,130
successes and we kind of coined that

354
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,030
coined the phrase you don't need to buy

355
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,130
stuff to do spy stuff and they just kept

356
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,900
expanding their reach and expanding

357
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,400
their operations in a number of areas so

358
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,410
yeah we're looking at 2017 this is when

359
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,810
fireEye

360
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,270
first outed apt 32 for conducting these

361
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,589
private intrusions and this is what they

362
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:05,030
look like comparing it on the same graph

363
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,820
we would just see them take tools and

364
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,080
techniques released from on Twitter or

365
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,209
github and stuff like that and implement

366
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,380
them within weeks sometimes

367
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,899
but often months into their program so

368
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,140
they they had these fully featured back

369
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,950
doors windshield being a TCP based

370
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,230
backdoor soundbyte dns and for real

371
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,690
being an ICMP based backdoor those are

372
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,820
there go twos but they the way they

373
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,320
would package and deliver them they

374
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,459
would deliver them with you know

375
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,890
publicly available tools bypasses they

376
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:48,089
find and just set up basic persistence

377
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,130
and launched these payloads using like a

378
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,779
kind of living off the land technique of

379
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,209
the day and wrapping it up and loading

380
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:59,120
their shellcode with cobalt strikes

381
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,060
shellcode loader and at some point we we

382
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,420
took the time to to examine how long

383
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,800
between when they were using these

384
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,089
techniques in the wild and when they

385
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:17,550
were originally shared and so we're in

386
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,290
the middle of some some looks at some of

387
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,640
the commands they were running or the

388
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,220
first time some of those were seen and

389
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,550
they're just big fans of they're paying

390
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,290
attention on Twitter and stuff like that

391
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,130
and implement them into their intrusions

392
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,839
pretty quickly as soon as they meet

393
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,339
resistance that's what was interesting

394
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,160
you know as the attackers were shaped or

395
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,600
as people responded to or tried to

396
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,769
squeeze them out of certain networks

397
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,690
that's when they just roll to the next

398
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,430
thing that they had been collecting and

399
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,910
put into their operations so I thought

400
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,140
one of the more inching ones though is

401
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,880
we were you know doing an investigation

402
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,230
and you know cohosh like the the trial

403
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,519
version was deployed to multiple

404
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,290
different systems and we didn't really

405
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,569
know how it got there so you know Nick

406
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,530
you want to walk through kind of like

407
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,900
the research project that we found and

408
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,329
yeah sure yeah we couldn't we couldn't

409
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,380
figure out how it got on there was

410
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,849
pushed out to all systems and couldn't

411
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,559
couldn't figure it out and then as it

412
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,730
turned out here's the the benefit so

413
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,410
just as a quick side note I know some

414
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,329
people feel that when we're looking at

415
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,510
the economics of attacker read sourcing

416
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,460
we're not giving credit to how

417
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,290
can help defenders or not talking about

418
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,940
the lift that gives to blue team so

419
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,220
we'll get into that some but I wanted to

420
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,050
highlight here that because we've seen

421
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,740
it before we had some light weight

422
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,000
detection x' a couple different places

423
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,220
one of these in this case is for the the

424
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,640
do it very variable and that right there

425
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,930
was seen over plaintext with our network

426
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,640
sensor at fireEye and it's actually an

427
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,560
EPO push so this is it turned out we had

428
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,810
these cobalt strike loader signatures

429
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,280
and they were firing we took a look at

430
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,970
it and that packet is actually the

431
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,500
McAfee epolicyworks trader server

432
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,420
pushing that out with a software

433
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,830
deployment task so that was really cool

434
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,170
we hadn't seen that before and before we

435
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,040
gave apt 32 too much credit we started

436
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,120
to take a look for where they may have

437
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,830
gotten that idea and it turned out there

438
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,260
was this kind of obscure project by fun

439
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,050
over IP drone Nutkin where he released a

440
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,320
tool he policy and it it had to do with

441
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,090
this a reused key they and you could

442
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,130
abuse and drop this and push it out to

443
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,940
all systems so KB that knowledgebase

444
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,970
named PowerShell script was cobalt

445
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,410
strike and it was just pushed out to all

446
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,790
systems using EPO with this tool so next

447
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,320
slide I think we we may have originally

448
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,150
shown a little bit more about how we

449
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,790
found it but so AP 32 also conducted

450
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,770
information operations which is kind of

451
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,720
interesting when we talked at the cyber

452
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,430
war Con and gave people some insight

453
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,750
into this they're really interested in

454
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,670
groups conducting information operations

455
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,490
but all I'll say there is that again

456
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,900
this is just more things they're able to

457
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,690
do while conducting the same intrusions

458
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,520
with those same tools so from a tool and

459
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,890
resource standpoint heavily leaning on

460
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,690
read sourcing and using it for all those

461
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,190
things at the bottom which is just

462
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,580
different seeing people use cobalt

463
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,670
strike and these Tweety peas to conduct

464
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,810
information operations so they were

465
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,170
actually grabbing files from some

466
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,810
victims and selectively releasing them

467
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,299
or modifying them and releasing them

468
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,539
to the public it's actually still tied

469
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,429
to that corporate compliance and

470
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:53,399
oversight where it was just to kind of

471
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:56,070
frustrate the public on how certain

472
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,480
companies were acting whether or not

473
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,070
they were acting this way or not it was

474
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,039
it was just an interesting new thing to

475
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,700
see from from a group that's read

476
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,489
sourcing oh you should know that you

477
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,470
know I don't know what I'm talking about

478
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,809
here so this is one of my biggest fans

479
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,549
around the time we were publishing the

480
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:19,519
apt 32 research giving it his thoughts

481
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,399
so yeah there is a really interesting

482
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:27,350
case is probably one of the you know

483
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,539
largest cases of actually a real I guess

484
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,340
attempted cyber attack could there have

485
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,440
been relatively few you know cyber cases

486
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,450
where the the intent or goal has been

487
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,940
destruction in the physical world and

488
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,830
not just like wiping computers but like

489
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,960
actually causing a plan to blow up and

490
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,450
so Nick and actually both helped out

491
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,470
with a team at mandiant do an

492
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,659
investigation of particular threat after

493
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:56,369
we tracked that we called at the time

494
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:59,580
you know on Kate 78 when we talked about

495
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,049
it publicly it was Triton and then

496
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,210
trisys and then I think DHS came out

497
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,409
with my favorite name they called it hat

498
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,749
man so had many different names but you

499
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:10,200
know they they were actually attempting

500
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,019
to deploy a piece of lucious software at

501
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,940
a at a you know a plant that that you

502
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,389
know manufactured stuff and the goal was

503
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:25,499
to kind of upload firmware to the safety

504
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:26,789
intermittent system which is kind of

505
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:28,080
like a governor on the plant that

506
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,320
prevents it from from the devices from

507
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,809
from going too fast and so you know it

508
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,700
failed that stage so they never got to

509
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,850
the destructive part but you want to

510
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,049
walk through kind of what that campaign

511
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,960
look like and oh by the way if people

512
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,210
haven't heard the Triton story I still

513
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,350
need to listen to it but one of my

514
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,779
favorite podcasts by Jack resetar

515
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:51,419
Don darknet Diaries he just did an

516
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,730
episode on Triton this past week so if

517
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,529
you want to learn more from a

518
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,240
storytelling approach definitely check

519
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,380
that out

520
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,320
so this one was entering in that you

521
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,010
know the the actor behind this used kind

522
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,140
of a variety of somewhere somewhere

523
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,120
public available tools you know a lot of

524
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,700
what they did was you know using P link

525
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,740
and bit vice encrypt at which are all

526
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,419
kind of freely available tools and

527
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,530
libraries and they kind of turned him

528
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,039
into a back door or tunnel or they you

529
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,049
know pepper that in with some some rats

530
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,000
or feelings of let me plant Go Fish and

531
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,580
VOC maybe cats and then complimented

532
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,100
that by you know where they needed to in

533
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,960
kind of the harder target of their

534
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,520
environment that's where they deployed

535
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,340
more of their custom tools so train

536
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,200
being uh the the the most sophisticated

537
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,510
those because to be able to develop that

538
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,309
you actually had to have access to a

539
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:43,980
physical device yourself that would it

540
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,000
would be a one of these safety

541
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,980
instrumented systems that you could

542
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,020
develop the custom firmware for figure

543
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,330
out how to get it uploaded you know etc

544
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,510
so there's there's a lot of both them

545
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,010
domain-specific expertise to develop it

546
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:03,600
as well as you know cyber expertise it

547
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,940
was interesting when when doing the

548
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,770
research to kind of pull this together

549
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,919
we were going back and there was this

550
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,030
report that this organization

551
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,159
cybersecurity company called Cybele and

552
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,320
put out and remember when it came out it

553
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,600
was it was called Operation double agent

554
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,360
and they mostly focus on how you could

555
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,309
like use this particular technique to

556
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,620
avoid any virus but tucked away in that

557
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,630
report I actually didn't I didn't even

558
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,970
remember it it was actually that tucked

559
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,340
away they actually released kind of a

560
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,490
new person since mechanism on Windows so

561
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,510
some of you may be familiar with a

562
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,820
particular person's technique where you

563
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,010
create a registry key called image file

564
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,140
execution options and you set a debugger

565
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,470
so let's say when you know Explorer dad

566
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,990
exe starts or when said HD daddy you see

567
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,429
starts you could have it also then fire

568
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,650
up Explorer done exe or community you

569
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,230
see well they found that if you actually

570
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,150
set what's called the verifier dll if

571
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,000
you point that to your malicious DLL you

572
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,860
can then get it to to launch or load you

573
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,140
know at boot time your backdoor or your

574
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,630
you know dll and the intern thing is yes

575
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,549
we then kind of correlate at the time

576
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:11,820
for

577
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,440
when this report was released when we

578
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,420
actually saw the technique used in the

579
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,670
wild originally I thought that what we

580
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,960
were finding or you know on the

581
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,460
investigation was like brand-new and

582
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,840
never been talked about and then we you

583
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,100
know started doing some research and

584
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,140
realized that this reporter come out it

585
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,820
was six weeks prior to that that they'd

586
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,530
learned about it read it and then

587
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,720
incorporated it into their into their

588
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,430
tradecraft

589
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,590
yeah it's just worth noting too that at

590
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,070
fireEye we went on to share more about

591
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,470
who actually conducted the intrusion so

592
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,060
like the central scientific research

593
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,640
institute of chemistry and mechanics see

594
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,570
I had to look at it see nihm was the

595
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,580
group that built it was a specific

596
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,020
Russian lab that built the tools to

597
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,240
conduct the intrusion and you know the

598
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,130
intrusion that led to the deployment of

599
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,890
this really specifically instrumented

600
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,200
safety system malware so it's just

601
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,610
interesting to see like where they

602
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,470
probably spent more of their time and

603
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,240
they probably spent less of their time

604
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,970
on developing their own persistence and

605
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:21,210
mechanisms or code good yep so let's

606
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,020
let's talk about a group that really has

607
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,370
up leveled and continues to benefit and

608
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,260
it makes a resolution we have a bunch of

609
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:37,680
favorites but so let's talk about apt 33

610
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,900
but specifically they're 2019 campaigns

611
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,610
so and this is at the end we'll give you

612
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,290
some resources to learn a little bit

613
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,700
more so when we're talking about these

614
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,660
campaigns we're talking about these

615
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,520
publicly released campaigns where we did

616
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,870
a big write-up and explain it to people

617
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,140
what these groups are doing so but

618
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,330
heavily read source they're they're

619
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:04,700
known for trying a bunch of different

620
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,680
red teaming frameworks and offensive

621
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,390
frameworks and just going through them

622
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:13,800
until one works their victims might be

623
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,450
you know might be behind maybe the rest

624
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,930
of the world sometimes but we've seen

625
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,850
that even on the same intrusion so you

626
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,309
know using unicorn

627
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:27,980
empire meterpreter pupae rat which is

628
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,149
the right way to say it

629
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:31,220
apostasy to and stuff like that and co

630
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,809
attic so if you don't follow Andrew

631
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:39,350
Thompson who certainly shares freely his

632
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,259
thoughts on on a big portion of this

633
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:44,179
debate he's one of the people that

634
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,029
always helped us chase around apt 33 it

635
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:48,559
seems like he was on every intrusion and

636
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,580
and watched all of this occur so yeah

637
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,860
they what they ended up doing though is

638
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,100
saving their their last payload trying

639
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,100
to avoid dropping it where possible and

640
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,409
their their workhorse back door once

641
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:05,269
they needed it once you force them to

642
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:07,429
have to drop it was the power come back

643
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:11,929
door and we gave a lot of background in

644
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:14,600
a blog post we put out about that but

645
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,509
one thing that they heavily used for

646
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:20,090
quite a while was different modules of

647
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,830
ruler the sets post tool specifically

648
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,830
homepage persistence and I think we have

649
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,860
another slide about that a little bit

650
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:38,409
more yep yes so about nine months after

651
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,179
we were we had put the blog out talking

652
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:43,419
about a BT 32 using it

653
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,490
apparently Cyber Command thought is

654
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,409
enough of an issue that they started

655
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:51,950
sharing that out in again like nine

656
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,039
months after that and sure enough they

657
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,619
were seeing and we continued to see apt

658
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:00,639
33 leverage this CVE

659
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:05,899
for rulers homepage persistence so yeah

660
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:11,149
it was interesting to see the Cyber

661
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,610
Command sort of call out some of these

662
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,059
specific techniques and you know part of

663
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:18,740
the challenge with with you know the

664
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,269
this particular vulnerability is because

665
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:23,179
it was a client-side vulnerability it

666
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:24,980
meant that you required organizations

667
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,600
and not just patch say their exchange

668
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,029
server or if they were using office 365

669
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:31,220
actually had to go to you know patch the

670
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,230
outlook client on every single system

671
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,740
and you know there's challenges we've

672
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,230
been doing doing that at scale as

673
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,120
she went I think at the the CV itself

674
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,390
was was fairly low on the severity level

675
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,360
and so you know we saw a lots of

676
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,860
different threat actors use this

677
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,929
particular technique to maintain

678
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:56,480
persistence in an environment yeah it's

679
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,820
funny after this presentation we went on

680
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,280
to see a bunch of other threat actors

681
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,870
including some authorized threat actors

682
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,809
at trusted SEC and we put out a blog

683
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,250
post about some really cool stuff they

684
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,720
were doing so we just saw we've seen a

685
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,570
lot of really really skilled red teamers

686
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:17,210
iterate on these techniques and in some

687
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,610
cases you know the tools get shared back

688
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,140
out picked up it's just interesting to

689
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,790
see that cycle so I mentioned bad

690
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,520
tribution up front to keep a lookout for

691
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,900
the fingerprints the different groups

692
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,490
glare did you want to talk a little bit

693
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,070
about that yeah so I mean there's

694
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,650
there's different things that red

695
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,200
sourcing can do for organizations that

696
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,500
conduct cyber operations at the the

697
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,390
lower end of the spectrum it can you

698
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,309
know give you more lift in terms of

699
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:48,679
capabilities but at the high end of that

700
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,340
the the spectrum and ABC 28 and 29 are

701
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,429
both you know Russian groups and they're

702
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,169
definitely - the more sophisticated ones

703
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:00,890
out there that we've encountered read

704
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,900
sourcing can actually kind of provide

705
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,400
kind of a cloak or a means of about view

706
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,530
skating you know who is behind a

707
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,750
particular thing especially in the

708
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,929
initial stages of an attack so on the

709
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:18,020
right there was a you know a phishing

710
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,320
campaign where they you know a b-29

711
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,980
deployed cobalt strike beacon but they

712
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,190
you know changed up a few things right

713
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,410
they didn't just take the you know um

714
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,470
you know Pandora valuable situ profile

715
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,929
they like modified it just slightly they

716
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:37,130
did all these different things so that

717
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,630
you know unless you looked really

718
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,919
closely and had a bunch of other pieces

719
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,929
to know it was them for the most part

720
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:43,400
you just say oh well cobalt strike got

721
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,650
used on this person or you know here's

722
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,330
another backdoor I'm not really sure who

723
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,250
it is especially if they used all brand

724
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,660
new you know pre and control

725
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,850
had never never you say an IP address or

726
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,970
domain we see lots of different threat

727
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,010
actors especially the kind of initial

728
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,720
phase of the attack lifecycle where

729
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,950
their first breaking into an

730
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,520
organization and increasingly just you

731
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,050
know leveraging more and more tooling

732
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,180
throughout a read source tooling

733
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,830
throughout as much of the lifecycle as

734
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,750
they can to kind of frustrate or make

735
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,420
attribution more difficult you know

736
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,090
there are certain groups especially you

737
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,650
know 10 15 years ago where you know if

738
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,110
you found a piece of malware let's say a

739
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,830
p3 only 83 use that malware there was

740
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,780
never we never ran across a single group

741
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,170
that did ever use their backdoor so if

742
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,760
you found one other piece of malware you

743
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,960
knew instantly was 83 but you know if

744
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,490
you juxtapose that with with some of

745
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,560
these other groups they now start to try

746
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,700
and move away from that as much as they

747
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,470
can to make it really difficult to do

748
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:48,090
that oh yeah I was just gonna say on the

749
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,100
go ahead give him the story on the left

750
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,260
side so on the left side it's actually a

751
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,560
piece that you know ATT 28 was was

752
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,240
targeting there's a bunch of public

753
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,540
reports I pulled this from one of them

754
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,590
but they were actually doing closed

755
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,540
access operations so if you remember the

756
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,550
the poisoning of the the scribbles in

757
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:10,140
which is a some people in the in the UK

758
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,040
they were dissidents for from Russia and

759
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,760
they were poisoned the lab that ended up

760
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,710
doing the analysis of that poisoning was

761
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,830
in the Netherlands and so there was a

762
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:27,080
close access operation that the you know

763
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,720
Russian military intelligence conducted

764
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,260
that the you know Dutch intelligence got

765
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,000
you know pictures and they followed them

766
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,910
etc they're set up but they're set up

767
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,530
was they physically went to that

768
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,820
location and they were trying to you

769
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,600
know break in using you know connected

770
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,860
to the Wi-Fi and then they were using a

771
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,570
spider lapse tool called responder to

772
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,220
then poison their DNS and get a an ntlm

773
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,400
hash or NetBIOS hash and you know so

774
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,110
that was combining kind of red sourcing

775
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,130
with

776
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,070
the close access operation so the the

777
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,990
tooling they use and what the end goal

778
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,780
of that on the cyber side was kind of

779
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,950
didn't make the press or at least what

780
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,809
they were doing it was more the pictures

781
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:18,690
of the the crew and their setup etc yeah

782
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,580
I don't think that people have really

783
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,799
still put that together too much so when

784
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,539
we were at fire I we released a blog

785
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,190
post and I sat next to the guys that

786
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,010
were working on that the incident

787
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,340
response in hospitality where responder

788
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,080
was seen and it was seen at these

789
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,059
certain hotels locations and you know

790
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,850
fast forward to when this came out you

791
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,260
know it helped put the whole story

792
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,870
together we just saw from the incident

793
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,520
response perspective we saw responder

794
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:51,419
running on the network so that takes us

795
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,960
to kind of our lost you know more to the

796
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,900
present right with our this is a report

797
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,059
that the Australian cybersecurity Center

798
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,419
came out with just a week or two ago

799
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:04,919
where they talked about you know a set

800
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,210
of campaign against Australian

801
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,219
organizations and so I went through the

802
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,199
report it was actually a really in-depth

803
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,359
report about the different types of you

804
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,399
know it was multiple different campaigns

805
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,129
you know over time over say several

806
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:19,469
months but I went through and I kind of

807
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,510
catalogued you know all the activity of

808
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,710
what happened and then you know

809
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,929
highlighted it here for you so you have

810
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,290
a couple different but they kind of kept

811
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,550
driving home this concept throughout the

812
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,050
entire report was that they were using

813
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,440
you know mostly publicly available tools

814
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,739
on like on get up so they not only did

815
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,780
they target the Seavey's for from an

816
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,270
exploitation perspective for I think it

817
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,040
was a SharePoint CVE citrix netscaler

818
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,090
and telluric web UI they actually

819
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,550
leveraged the whole like the actual

820
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,040
proof of concept code that was released

821
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,010
by the you know offensive security

822
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,470
community when when when discussing that

823
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,680
vulnerability they complemented that so

824
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,780
they used three different publicly

825
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,330
available web shells hi shell a win and

826
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,820
behind her but then they complemented

827
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,990
that with kind of some of their own

828
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,570
custom ones so they you know HTTP core

829
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,869
and this C sharp assembler web shell

830
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:17,520
they could actually pass

831
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,040
you know a.net assembly to the web shell

832
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,710
and then it would you know invoke that

833
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,330
so they customize where they needed to

834
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,700
but then they leverage whole swathes of

835
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,450
open-source tool link including you know

836
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,070
is it consistent theme here cobalt rake

837
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,640
beacon and actually a fairly recent new

838
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,650
capability that was rolled into the

839
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,870
PowerShell Empire framework where it

840
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,400
could actually communicate to a an azure

841
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:51,710
Roth app via onedrive not for long

842
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,120
there's the exciting stuff coming there

843
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,070
but it's that was a definitely a cool

844
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,440
report to take a look at and being

845
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,500
labeled the copy/paste campaign you can

846
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,740
you know kind of know put nails upon the

847
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:09,210
head there so I thought it would be

848
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,830
interesting to kind of compare visually

849
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:17,520
you know the the first group that we

850
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,080
talked about it's apt one and kind of

851
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,430
compare them with them you know today

852
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,410
right with with the copy/paste campaign

853
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,020
and and highlight visually kind of how

854
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,580
different they look right yeah obviously

855
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,060
you know apt one leverage most mostly

856
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,130
custom tooling and they augmented with

857
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,350
that with with a handful of tools from

858
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,640
the criminal underground and especially

859
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,820
password numbers from from from you know

860
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,380
the the offensive security community and

861
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,560
then the copy-paste campaign is you know

862
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,340
almost exclusively either free or read

863
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,280
source utilities within a handful of

864
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,680
custom things you know we're needed in

865
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,440
part you know I think because they're

866
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,180
you know operating at the higher end of

867
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,470
the spectrum from the capabilities

868
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,330
perspective there were some unique

869
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,190
things they did to make it more more

870
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,710
difficult to catch or detect them but so

871
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,940
they spent their time on you know

872
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,850
evasion and and kind of creative

873
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,410
techniques to not be detected and then

874
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,800
complimented that with with with

875
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,330
customized tooling so you can really

876
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,770
highlight it especially the change over

877
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,660
say a ten year period and what that

878
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,200
looks like

879
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,590
and keep in mind that a big a big push

880
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,010
here was that there's reasons there

881
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,220
weren't tools available that

882
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,220
pushed adversary capability way back

883
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,320
then right we didn't really get into it

884
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,720
at the beginning but it's worth noting

885
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,710
when you look at something like this

886
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,010
that red teaming didn't really exist

887
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,130
offensive security was more pen testing

888
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,410
and oak liar that's what your background

889
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,570
was before you got into to incident

890
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,250
response just focusing on the perimeter

891
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,400
pen testing so we're not really like I'm

892
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,900
not giving an opinion either way we're

893
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,200
reporting the news that as the offensive

894
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,109
security teams started doing full

895
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:06,230
life-cycle intrusions they continued to

896
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,130
do the amazing work there and sharing

897
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,550
that they they do that's benefited red

898
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:17,450
and blue alike but when they began to

899
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,910
work in the later stages of intrusions

900
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,490
um and released those tools those have

901
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,099
been picked up for various reasons by

902
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:27,380
all these different threat actors so the

903
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,119
intrusions just look so different and I

904
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,160
and you know we're talking here about

905
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,260
targeted intrusions comparing them or or

906
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,720
sort of for specific reasons but

907
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,099
definitely don't overlook that the right

908
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:43,130
side is is what a lot of you know

909
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,440
ransomware deployment and stuff like

910
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,750
that look like all they everything sort

911
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,130
of looks the same at the beginning until

912
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,890
it until it doesn't and you're you know

913
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,270
that's kind of yeah

914
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,310
yeah it kind of leads us to this here

915
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,750
where I think we don't want to get this

916
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,680
isn't about like it would be incorrect

917
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,710
to summarize and think that the takeaway

918
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,170
is that red team research is a problem

919
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,890
or that we are suggesting or taking a

920
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,040
stance that brings back think it takes

921
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,630
away for from the progress made on

922
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,119
talking about the utility of an exploit

923
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,190
POC and stuff like that this is really

924
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,349
to let people know that this stuff

925
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:35,890
really matters that there's red team

926
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,890
tools and research is used is watched by

927
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,599
everyone it's used by all kinds of

928
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,579
attackers we like to say authorized and

929
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:47,589
unauthorized we just would always

930
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:50,579
categorize them together in fact on the

931
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:53,050
fire I advanced practices team where I

932
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,230
came from we really treated all activity

933
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,420
the same and we would cluster and sort

934
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,359
of tactically attribute regardless and

935
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,589
that's good because that's what we

936
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:05,319
wanted we wanted we looked at detection

937
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,319
the same way too like these are

938
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:09,369
techniques you should be focusing on

939
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,369
upfront and not worry so much about

940
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:13,180
attribution or not worry so much about

941
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,099
the effects after that if you can handle

942
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:17,800
it upfront so and the key here is just

943
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,319
think for that detection and for

944
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,329
collecting on people's infrastructure

945
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:24,160
and stuff like that folk focus on read

946
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,460
read source tools and techniques it's

947
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,920
very there's a high threat density

948
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,950
there's a high return on investment and

949
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,720
there's I think some some recent

950
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,609
examples of you know the offensive

951
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:38,290
security community contributing both on

952
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,359
the offensive side but also coupling

953
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:43,030
that with with either detection or or

954
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,430
other things so it sends post you know

955
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,010
not only did they release the tool ruler

956
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,960
but then they also came up with defense

957
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,819
guidance a tool called out ruler so you

958
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:53,770
could actually detect it or find it

959
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,190
yourself

960
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,160
trusted SEC recently when they release

961
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,630
are proof of concept for the citrix

962
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,420
netscaler vulnerability they also had a

963
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,460
really you know amazingly detailed blog

964
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,290
post about what that looks like the

965
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,329
forensics the kind of blue team side of

966
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:08,950
it that really helped a lot of different

967
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,839
organizations as they were that dealing

968
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:11,410
with you know

969
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,490
tax that were that were happening

970
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:17,020
against those net scalars and you know

971
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,450
make sure that you know you decouple you

972
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,160
know attackers from their tools right

973
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,990
you know red team techniques are used

974
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,280
way more than just by the red team and

975
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,960
you guys are doing intelligent

976
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,490
attribution don't just you know don't

977
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,650
just assume that that something is a red

978
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,059
team because it's using red source to

979
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:37,660
link and well cuz well resource agencies

980
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,700
and kind of across the spectrum are also

981
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,049
using those that that definitely makes

982
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:44,020
that a lot more more more difficult yeah

983
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,319
and the if you want to read more on that

984
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:49,089
one we mentioned it briefly the apt

985
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,520
twenty nine example of wanting to be

986
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,470
underestimated and trying to look like

987
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,319
they were using some out of the box

988
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:58,720
straight off of github valuable situ

989
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,240
profiles when in reality they tweaked it

990
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,910
just enough and they did they they

991
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,950
really thought through each phase of it

992
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,599
and if it sounds like I'm overthinking

993
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,460
you got to check out the blog post and

994
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,990
we have links here will probably drop

995
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,599
them in the discord channel and chat

996
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,460
through it but it's just it's really

997
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,140
interesting I think to see some of the

998
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,690
recent shift so that or there's just the

999
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,309
changing like landscape is people figure

1000
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,859
out what makes sense or what makes sense

1001
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:31,450
for for them again not that anything is

1002
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,240
good or bad it just is I know for a

1003
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,380
while people would ask when we try to

1004
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,230
talk about I guess sensitive topics like

1005
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,210
this especially from the blue team

1006
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,890
perspective people sort of asked should

1007
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,359
it be done there's not really a good

1008
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,309
answer it's really I I feel like there's

1009
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:55,809
just a bunch of different models that

1010
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:57,549
all have different trade-offs and we we

1011
00:42:57,549 --> 00:43:00,279
talked a little bit other times about

1012
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:02,200
you know what's it look like if somebody

1013
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,539
tries to keep a tool all to themselves

1014
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:06,430
well in some cases if it's powerful

1015
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,650
enough maybe that's not possible if you

1016
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,140
take Benjamin Del P and Mimi cats and

1017
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,609
the the evil made scenario where his his

1018
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:17,170
hotel room was intruded upon when he's

1019
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,319
giving a a presentation at a security

1020
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,779
conference in Russia or you have the

1021
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:24,910
licensed model that

1022
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,510
licensed model like cobalt strike

1023
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,280
factoring out the trial versions and

1024
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,960
stuff like that and you know people will

1025
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,600
still attempt to to crack that and they

1026
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,730
threw their doing the right thing there

1027
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,210
and continue to try to tighten that up

1028
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,400
so there's a license model there's where

1029
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,930
someone tried to keep it totally private

1030
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,620
one of the things I saw in the past

1031
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:51,190
couple weeks is there's like github has

1032
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,650
a sponsorship model I think right so

1033
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,390
Marcelo a bike bleeder

1034
00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:00,280
um rightfully so he's any note anybody

1035
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,660
knows if you do an open source project

1036
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,360
it just can consume you and it's not

1037
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,980
like other people take it and run with

1038
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,410
it it's just a lot on you to maintain so

1039
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,880
they're sort of like it's like patreon

1040
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,410
for poor development and there's a you

1041
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,300
can sponsor him on github and basically

1042
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,000
get timed access or early access to the

1043
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,180
tools to allow you know people that will

1044
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,450
take that step to have access to

1045
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,760
something earlier when it's more

1046
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,080
innovative and everything like that I

1047
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,030
just thought that was really cool I'm

1048
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,830
also encouraged by a lot of the people

1049
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:42,130
are our co-worker cyberwar dog he's been

1050
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,230
making some offers and some suggestions

1051
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,120
and following up different people's tool

1052
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,710
and technique releases with pretty

1053
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,900
in-depth review of the telemetry it

1054
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,090
creates and detection and I've tried in

1055
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,770
the past previously to reach out and

1056
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,180
sort of co-author a detection portion of

1057
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,410
people's blog posts if they're going to

1058
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,180
release something and it's just I'm

1059
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,320
optimistic I think about the direction

1060
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,000
but it's just really challenging and

1061
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,890
interesting how much the shape of

1062
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:13,120
intrusions has changed you know due to

1063
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:18,310
the red source tooling well that

1064
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,010
concludes our presentation for today

1065
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,690
we'll look forward to taking questions

1066
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,540
in the Q&A thanks
