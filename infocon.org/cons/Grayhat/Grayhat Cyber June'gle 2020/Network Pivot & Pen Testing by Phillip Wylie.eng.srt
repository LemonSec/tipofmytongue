so in this particular session is pawning

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,480
networks and introduction to network pin

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,070
testing so I'm about you but I'm excited

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,259
about seeing this one this particular

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,269
session is going to cover a lot of great

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,580
hands-on tools and as we were talking

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,140
about you've got an excellent instructor

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,949
here so please if you will use the chat

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,109

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,340
using this year to make sure that we get

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,870
an opportunity to chat and have good

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,910
conversations so without further ado

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,809
Phillip Wylie is going to be educating

21
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,510
you on honing networks through pin

22
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,730
testing so take it away my friend hey

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,649
thanks for the warm introduction and

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,199
welcome everyone to this session hope

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,449
everyone is enjoying the conference so

26
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,670
far Joseph's been known to put on some

27
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,620
really good conferences and we're

28
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,059
fortunate to have all these virtual

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,229
conferences with the social isolation

30
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:09,630
the previous conference that Joseph did

31
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,150
back in May I guess or so was pretty

32
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,360
cool and and get the also got the red

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,119
team village coming up in August I guess

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,939
around DEFCON time but anyway thank you

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,900
for for joining not only do I work as a

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,490
pen tester I've been working as a

37
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,799
dedicated pen tester for a little over

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,900
eight years now I had my OS CP for a

39
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,509
little over seven years but I'm the red

40
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,590
team lead at a large global consumer

41
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,799
products manufacturing company and I'm

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
also the adjunct professor Richland

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,130
College a teach ethical hacking and web

44
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,290
app pentesting there I like to teach

45
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,820
workshops and plan to do more in the

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,490
future so just keep your eyes out

47
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,140
hopefully come up with some new topics

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,939
and tomorrow if you haven't registered

49
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,810
I'm doing a web app pentesting workshop

50
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,310
tomorrow and these are you know

51
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,920
entry-level introduction courses to

52
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,229
teach you some of the basics and and how

53
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,389
to get into you know get started in pen

54
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,250
testing and I'll share some educational

55
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,620
resources but I'm also the the

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,989
under the palm school project which is

57
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:18,150
an educational meetup which started out

58
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,629
was mainly offensive security topics but

59
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,519
it's kind of it's kind of changed over

60
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,379
the years I mean I well it's like we've

61
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,760
only been around almost tears but it's

62
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,920
it's changed as times gone on because

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,480
there were a lot of people trying to get

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,950
into security in general so we don't

65
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,280
restrict it to just hacking type of

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,180
talks we expanded it past that but it's

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,730
we have our recordings online and on our

68
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,690
YouTube page and so and we stream to

69
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,220
meetings a month so that information is

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,829
out there so I've been in IT and

71
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,239
information security for a little over

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,410
22 years

73
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm also the co-host of the uncommon

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,609
journey podcast with Alyssa Miller in

75
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,400
Chloe Muskogee and I was one of the

76
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,659
people interviewed for the tribe of

77
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,609
hackers Red Team book so uh what really

78
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:07,920
got me into presenting at conferences in

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,379
doing workshops was my passion to to

80
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,430
share and teach when I got into you know

81
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,720
accurate well you know I've been in pen

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,069
testing a while some people wanted to

83
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,810
ask me questions on how to study for the

84
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,139
SCP so I started sharing information so

85
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,880
that got me interested in teaching so

86
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,650
I'm able to do that on a broader scale

87
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,230
now and so we're going to cover some

88
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,359
some methodology go over some

89
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,590
methodology information here and so if

90
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,540
you haven't checked out pen test at

91
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,359
standard org is for the PTAs standard

92
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:44,819
the penetration testing execution

93
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,329
standard and this is a really great

94
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,680
standard to go by for your pen testing

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,690
this takes you from beginning to end of

96
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,699
the pen test and it's written by a lot

97
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,019
of great people that you've probably

98
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,690
heard of an industry Dave Kennedy is one

99
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,359
of the writers from trusted SEC as well

100
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,489
as Carlos Perez from trusted sec Joe

101
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,760
McCray that does a lot of training and

102
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,190
conferences and online and numerous

103
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,349
others so this was built by experts in

104
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,048
industry it wasn't just someone that put

105
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,760
together a list it didn't it wasn't

106
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,529
experts it was people that actually been

107
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,899
doing this in the field hands on and

108
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,960
some of the best around and also some

109
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,600
other good up

110
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,430
methodologies and information look at is

111
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,889
the whole wasp top ten and a wasp

112
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,530
testing guide so these if you need to

113
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,580
learn a little more about web app

114
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,930
pentesting these are good resources

115
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,350
there and a good place to learn wasp

116
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,570
top ten if you want to get into pen

117
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,460
testing one of the things you'll go

118
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,470
through in a job interview is

119
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,810
notoriously the vulnerabilities they get

120
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,780
at you could ask about whether it's

121
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,919
specializing in web a pen testing or

122
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,250
just a normal General's pen test job

123
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,449
where your main focus is going to be

124
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:59,520
networks they're still going to ask you

125
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,800
about sequel injection and cross-site

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,169
scripting the different types and how to

127
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,090
remediate so just knowing those are

128
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,580
really good for for interviews just

129
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,520
knowing that information and so the

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
PETA's methodology you have your

131
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,820
pre-engagement interactions

132
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,360
intelligence-gathering threat modeling

133
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,280
vulnerability analysis exploitation post

134
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,979
exploitation and reporting but as you're

135
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,889
getting started out as a pen tester a

136
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,660
lot of the pre-engagement interactions

137
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,270
are going to be ran by practice leads or

138
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,830
engagement managers they're going to

139
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,599
work with clients to collect information

140
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,630
to scope a pen test and so as a pen

141
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,220
tester you'll be more likely and

142
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,889
involved on like the the kickoff calls

143
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,780
in some of the meetings for the pen test

144
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,460
but typically when you're getting

145
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,870
started out someone else is running

146
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,090
those collected information so when

147
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,340
you're getting started you know we're

148
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,550
gonna you're gonna be more focused on

149
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,900
intelligence gathering down through

150
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,970
reporting and in this we're going to

151
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,060
focus more on intelligence gathering not

152
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,440
so much on threat modeling the

153
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,090
vulnerability analysis and exploitation

154
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,090
and discussed post exploitation and

155
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,020
reporting threat modeling some of this

156
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,539
is just as you learned a pen test a lot

157
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,000
of this just comes naturally you kind of

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,630
from hacking systems and doing pen tests

159
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,340
you kind of know the areas to look for

160
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,810
so like in your more advanced targets

161
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,789
like if you're wanting to test like a an

162
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,639
ATM machine then that gets a little more

163
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,560
tricky because then you're looking at

164
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,970
not only you're looking at the ways you

165
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,979
can hack the system you're also looking

166
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,560
at the environments this this system is

167
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,599
hosted in so if you're if you're looking

168
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,050
at eight

169
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,020
a machine that resides somewhere out in

170
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,599
the country that's no one is is

171
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,400
monitoring it 24 hours a day there's not

172
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,530
a lot of traffic then physical attacks

173
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,470
gonna be more more likely whereas if

174
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,509
it's you know a heavy heavily populated

175
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,539
place more your logical type of attacks

176
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,520
less trying to break into it physically

177
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,490
or going to occur so you're taking that

178
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,180
target and you're also taking in

179
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,099
consideration in the environment and so

180
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,449
this you go through and you'll look at

181
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,370
what you're testing you look at the

182
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,979
different threat surfaces that you can

183
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,110
possibly attack and try to counter you

184
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,210
map out your pen test because where

185
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,360
you're doing application or network it's

186
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,550
really not as big of a requirement it's

187
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,530
kind of loosely a little more loosely

188
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,449
done and your vulnerability analysis

189
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,310
you're going through any information

190
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,599
you've collected during your

191
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,750
intelligence gathering and see if

192
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,159
there's anything that's vulnerable as

193
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,509
well as doing any kind of scanning to

194
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:38,819
collect more information exploitation is

195
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,110
where you're actually hacking into the

196
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,599
system so this is where the the fun part

197
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,229
starts so you go through and and hack

198
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,599
the system and post exploitation is what

199
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,250
you can do past exploiting that one

200
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,699
system hey fella yes hey sorry to

201
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,560
interrupt you buddy the slides are not

202
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,440
advancing so if you're on the first

203
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,449
slide that's all we're seeing we're

204
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,210
actually just seeing your your slide

205
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,580
sorter view can you see it now now

206
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,310
hasn't it hasn't updated yet okay let me

207
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,969
go back and we share this there we go

208
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:18,150
okay see yeah let means good all right

209
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,989
sorry about that folks

210
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,240
so this is

211
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,130
the way you can get and see the URLs and

212
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,199
after that you know message me on disk

213
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,810
or and I'm pretty frequent on that disc

214
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,309
court so you can see me address direct

215
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,919
message or or message me in the chats in

216
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,219
general but here the the the resources

217
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,559
that I was mentioning there the pen test

218
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,110
standard you know wasup top ten and

219
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,580
these are really really good resources

220
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,720
and they're referred in a lot of

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,720
different training and books and here's

222
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,209
the PTAs methodology as i said we're

223
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:55,589
gonna be focusing more on from the

224
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,560
intelligence gathering down to the post

225
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,750
exploitation and kind of a simplified

226
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,060
methodology this is just very basic your

227
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,990
intelligence gathering your

228
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,880
reconnaissance against that target

229
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,690
vulnerability analysis and exploitation

230
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,660
and within that post exploit close to

231
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,610
exploitation as well so your

232
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,990
intelligence gathering your just your

233
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,459
gathering information against your

234
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,339
target and this could be going to if

235
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,140
it's externally facing then you've got

236
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,029
companies like net crafts that have

237
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:29,339
online sites that you can look up

238
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,600
information on targets mainly web web

239
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,339
application based or where you know web

240
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,920
sites they'll you can find out what

241
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,820
system is being hosted on what all

242
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,320
frameworks are running on it is this you

243
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,540
know is running aspx or is this a apache

244
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,810
tomcat server running Java server pages

245
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,160
they're able to collect that information

246
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,550
and show tans another good tool to use

247
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,070
during this phase I was doing a pen test

248
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,709
several years ago was a full scope pen

249
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,950
test more of a an adversary simulation

250
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,649
because everything was open including

251
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,350
physical and you know in kind of social

252
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,029
engineering eating that type of stuff

253
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,339
and so doing a look at lookup and showed

254
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,600
an topic you know the IP addresses and

255
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,550
stuff I was able to look up network

256
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,290
blocks and find out IP addresses that

257
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,839
were in scope we only knew the address

258
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,190
of the company in the name of the

259
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,320
company so we hadn't really researched

260
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,660
to find any IP addresses to test and

261
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,770
during that test I was able to find a

262
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,380
FTP header on an FTP server there wasn't

263
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,110
listed any of the

264
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,300
blocks and how if out it is shown in

265
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,420
found like a banner for the HTTP for the

266
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,300
FTP server and I was able to find that

267
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,700
server so that was a clear text FTP

268
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,610
server on the internet and so showed an

269
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,750
was able to find this so your

270
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,140
reconnaissance euro set is very very

271
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,000
helpful

272
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,839
going through LinkedIn different social

273
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,430
media platforms looking up information

274
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,000
so if you see openings for you know sis

275
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,839
admins or dev SEC ops people Network

276
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,959
people then a lot of times you'll see

277
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,670
what systems are requiring you to

278
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,980
understand so there if there a Cisco

279
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,660
shop they're going to be looking for

280
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,579
Cisco certifications or experience and

281
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,829
different Cisco products so you can go

282
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,810
through there and find that information

283
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,860
and possibly even find versions of the

284
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,570
software and stuff they're running as

285
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,550
well as if you look up people that work

286
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,920
for the company they may have in there

287
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,870
and their job description all the things

288
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,390
they do you know they want this

289
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,440
populated because that they're in the

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
market for a job or they're looking to

291
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,390
upgrade then their information is out

292
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,370
there so sometimes they give a lot of

293
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,839
details so this could be used during

294
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,180
your pen tests so more information you

295
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,820
collect there the better and once you

296
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,579
move on to the targets and you're on the

297
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,350
network you're in map scans and your

298
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,170
vulnerability scans can collect more

299
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,540
information on those targets so the more

300
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,390
information you collect the more chances

301
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,519
you have of hacking into something so

302
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,070
this is kind of going from like you know

303
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,050
you look at the different types of

304
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,709
target knowledge and so you look at more

305
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,570
of an adversarial type simulation or a

306
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,820
lot of your pin tests will you'll have

307
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,829
like IP addresses or a domain name and

308
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:25,660
that's it and you test from there so the

309
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,029
more information you collect on it the

310
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,699
more knowledge that you've got to attack

311
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:31,959
that target that's like if you took

312
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,940
someone that works for the company doing

313
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,610
internal pen tests then they understand

314
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,160
the environment better than then a

315
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,110
consultant water a contractor come in

316
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,060
and test the environment so they were I

317
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,560
collected information so it's up to

318
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,290
someone from the outside that's not part

319
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,110
of that company to do a lot more manual

320
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,760
collection to be able to

321
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,240
to test that system it so there's

322
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,010
different types of open source

323
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,779
intelligence you have passive semi

324
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,500
passive and active so your passive is

325
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,910
collecting from the sites like LinkedIn

326
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,320
something that's not touching that

327
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,990
target and then like net craft semi

328
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,639
passive you're starting to get into your

329
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,860
your DNS lookups and stuff in really

330
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,329
high level scans and you get into your

331
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,740
active information gathering where

332
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,690
you're doing your port scans and stuff

333
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,100
this kind of gets more into your

334
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,100
reconnaissance and less away from Oh set

335
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,310
specific so so like we said you know

336
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,769
collecting information is going to help

337
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:32,019
you be more successful in your tart on

338
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,490
your target and that's one of the things

339
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,440
too if you're if you're studying for

340
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,600
though SCP one of the big things that

341
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,220
people mess up on when they attempt the

342
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,600
exam maybe they'll pass it the first

343
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
time around is they didn't collect

344
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,600
enough information so that's what you

345
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,029
want to do so this this comes into play

346
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,560
like in your vulnerability analysis

347
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,180
we're doing more more of this

348
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,980
information you're doing you're doing

349
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,889
port scanning service gaming application

350
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:59,110
os enumeration and vulnerability

351
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,819
detection so while your vulnerability

352
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:05,310
scanners like necks pose

353
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,190
open vas and necess find those

354
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,690
vulnerabilities it's also good to know

355
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,870
how to manually collect that information

356
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,699
so how to manually detect those

357
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:17,620
vulnerabilities because there's times

358
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,990
different important when vulnerability

359
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,279
scanner will find something that another

360
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,410
one doesn't and vice versa and sometimes

361
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,709
some manual tools will find things like

362
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:28,089
nikto for instance I've ran nikto on

363
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,440
several pen tests and it's a

364
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,089
command-line tool for testing web

365
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,000
servers and web applications and I've

366
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,290
been able to find like default

367
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,240
credentials and stuff they were one of

368
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,190
those scans that necess didn't pick up

369
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,880
so the more tools you have the better so

370
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,699
you want to use all tools available to

371
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,889
you and keep an open mind constantly

372
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,269
learning learning new things

373
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,310
it's a vulnerability analysis you're

374
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,440
looking at your for the network you're

375
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,230
looking at port and service scanning

376
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,060
within map type on there should be in

377
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,450
map not in map but in

378
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:10,250
in masscan also the Metasploit framework

379
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,590
there's a lot of auxiliary scanners in

380
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,480
there that you can do to look at look

381
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,960
for anonymous FTP and different

382
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,480
vulnerable services so that's that's a

383
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,710
really good tool to have your expose

384
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,990
disposal it's not always about

385
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,910
exploitation with Metasploit there's a

386
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,160
lot of discovery that you can do with

387
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,340
that and then your NSE scripts your your

388
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,100
in map scripting engine scripts the

389
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,750
vulva script in particular is nice

390
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,440
because you're able to go through and

391
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,390
run your scans and what vault does is

392
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,580
Volvo run a script and looks for

393
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,930
vulnerabilities and it'll actually look

394
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,840
for the open source database

395
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,060
vulnerability open source well really

396
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,160
database numbers so you can look up more

397
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,940
information and possibly look up

398
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,100
exploits for those vulnerabilities and

399
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,830
then your vulnerability scanning is

400
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,820
important if you're doing a pen test a

401
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,010
lot you hear people before they get into

402
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,900
the industry they think vulnerability

403
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,760
scanning is cheating but what happens on

404
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,100
a pen test is you don't have you

405
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,720
typically don't have enough time to do

406
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,880
it all manually so your net your

407
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,340
vulnerability scanners they're able to

408
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,080
detect stuff easily so you want the

409
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,760
low-hanging fruit stuff you can find

410
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,490
quickly that way you can get that out of

411
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,080
the way and you can find some some

412
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,610
information there that you're able to

413
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,040
focus your attacks closer like I said

414
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,200
the the manual testing is important as

415
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,530
well but you don't want to rule out

416
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:39,170
using your vulnerability scanners and

417
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,570
also for the web there's there's your

418
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,240
dynamic application your desk your

419
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,970
dynamic application security testing

420
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,940
scanners which apps can web inspect a

421
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,760
kinetics next nets Parker and Arachne

422
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,980
and the commercial version of version of

423
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,600
burp suite has a vulnerability scanner

424
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,350
built-in as well as hostage app has a

425
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,720
built-in vulnerability scanner for web

426
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,060
application although you know the focus

427
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,680
of this is network when you're doing

428
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,710
testing the endpoint solutions companies

429
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,240
are getting better about securing stuff

430
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,200
so sometimes web or Wireless or some of

431
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,869
the best ways to get in because

432
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,950
sometimes the application

433
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,010
as artists locked down so those are

434
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,910
areas that you can try to break into and

435
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,850
then burp and zap or also what you refer

436
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,650
to as interception proxies you're able

437
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,840
to intercept that traffic manipulate

438
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,560
traffic and you're able to take

439
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,840
something and replay certain HTTP

440
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,940
requests and see if you get errors and

441
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,650
those errors sometimes we give you

442
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,700
information that leads to

443
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,920
vulnerabilities that you can exploit it

444
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,350
system and then man-in-the-middle proxy

445
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,420
is another one it's basically a

446
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,690
command-line proxy but that when you can

447
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,210
monitor the the HTTP traffic as you're

448
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,600
going along and also as far as the long

449
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,330
lines to your your Wireshark tools

450
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,100
running Wireshark where you're running a

451
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,050
pen test any kind of sniffers tea shark

452
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,820
to see any kind of see the way things

453
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,710
are reacting to your scanning on the

454
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,900
network and there's some more of the

455
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,310
open source tools you have out there

456
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,040
nikto as I mentioned WP scan if you're

457
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,650
scanning if you're testing WordPress

458
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,230
sites and so this is a good tool you

459
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,210
actually can get database information

460
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,960
credentials you can actually brute force

461
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,950
passwords all sorts of get information

462
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,110
there and you'll find vulnerable plugins

463
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,490
and this is something that you know that

464
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,400
a lot of times is a good way to hack

465
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,840
into a site if they're using WordPress

466
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,940
due to unsecure vulnerability in

467
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,220
security WordPress plugins and then w3 3

468
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,640
AF is another tool that's a command-line

469
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,510
vulnerability scanner you can launch

470
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,380
like the Java interface to it but it's

471
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,170
kind of it sometimes can crash a lot so

472
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,420
it's kind of better at times to run the

473
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,090
command line version of this and when

474
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,240
you're using w3f limit the amount of

475
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,530
options you're doing do your

476
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,450
reconnaissance first there's options

477
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,340
that you do everything and once and when

478
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,650
you do that the system gets overwhelmed

479
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,650
and and the application crash crashes so

480
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,330
that one you just have to approach with

481
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,170
with the extreme care and its sequel map

482
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,690
is a good one for sequel injection this

483
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,330
is a really good tool for testing sequel

484
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,610
injection and you're doing your

485
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,200
vulnerability scans if you find

486
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,510
something that's good to to validate

487
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:32,960
your goal

488
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,159
abilities because when you're doing your

489
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:36,860
vulnerability scans you also want to

490
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,500
make sure that you're doing validation

491
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,570
because a lot of times these scanners

492
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,179
they'll find false positives so you want

493
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,039
to go in and validate these these

494
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,710
vulnerabilities to make sure their

495
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,250
vulnerabilities before you try to

496
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,559
exploit them once you validate them then

497
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,270
you can move on to the exploitation

498
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,669
phase and so sequel map is a good way to

499
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:57,679
validate your sequel injection

500
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,500
vulnerabilities and dirt buster Derby

501
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,390
and go Buster are good tools for

502
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,539
discovering directories on a a web

503
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,390
server or website sometimes there is

504
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,620
information on there that they don't

505
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,419
want expose the public you could find

506
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,480
administrative directories files you can

507
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,510
find files on there that may contain you

508
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,159
know configuration information or

509
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,370
usernames and passwords so going and

510
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,990
looking for those directories doing your

511
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,510
directory brute-forcing is a really good

512
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,240
way to collect information for your pen

513
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,700
test and then exploitation here's some

514
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,429
good tools for your exploitation phase

515
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:36,529
exploit dB you've gone through your

516
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:39,620
vulnerability analysis you found some

517
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,799
vulnerable versions then you go to to

518
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,200
exploit DB and you're able to go through

519
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,370
and look up exploits for that system you

520
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,480
do a search on the vulnerable operating

521
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,270
system or software and it'll come back

522
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,409
and you want to make sure you put the

523
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:58,880
vulnerability information in I mean the

524
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,510
the version of the software and it'll

525
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,220
come back with possible exploits and

526
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,620
there's also a command line version of

527
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,049
that called sir exploit it's a script

528
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:12,230
that's on Kali Linux and other pen

529
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,909
testing distros like like parrot OS and

530
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:21,559
it searches a hosted locally hosted repo

531
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:24,950
of the exploit DB exploit database so

532
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,370
you're able to to access those exploits

533
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,750
in your system because sometimes you're

534
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,149
doing internal pen tests you know it

535
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:33,649
gets tricky to download those exploits

536
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:35,149
you may have to connect through a mobile

537
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:37,700
device that you have to to download go

538
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,200
off their network and that sort of thing

539
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,970
but if you have them locally then

540
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,130
sometimes that can save you time and you

541
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,740
can also search on your system for that

542
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,110
exploit

543
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,730
and then to Metasploit framework and

544
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,760
we've mentioned before this is not

545
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,250
manual some of the stuff automated for

546
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,860
it but you can use it for manual and

547
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,720
automated testing and this is an exploit

548
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,460
framework and usually a lot of the

549
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,720
popular exploits there rapid7 other

550
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,710
people that support the community the

551
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,450
application from a community standpoint

552
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,990
will convert exploits over to to a

553
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,330
Metasploit module so this is a really

554
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,309
good place to look and sometimes your

555
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:22,250
easy easy targets and one things that

556
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,850
you know some people want to avoid being

557
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,260
a script Kitty or they're worried about

558
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,880
something being too automated and it's

559
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,919
not leet but one thing you gotta

560
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,120
remember if you're gonna pen test you

561
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,040
want to find the vulnerabilities as

562
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,820
quickly you can use your time as best as

563
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,740
possible while you're learning this you

564
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,870
know you want to learn the manual and

565
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,520
automated methods but when you're on a

566
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,070
test then you want to your times limited

567
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,650
sometimes you may have a week to cover a

568
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,040
lot of IP addresses so the more you're

569
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,100
able to to make good use of your time

570
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,660
the better off you are and Plus this is

571
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,429
like one of the there's you don't have a

572
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:02,780
lot of options out there when it comes

573
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,120
to exploit frameworks a lot of the other

574
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,970
exploit frame prep frameworks like core

575
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,049
impact those are not free and there's

576
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:13,280
nothing there's no free version or

577
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
community version of it so those are can

578
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,500
be pretty expensive but if you're you

579
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,330
you get the luxury of your company's got

580
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,850
the luxury you do of having using necks

581
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,950
pose and Metasploit together then that

582
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,890
kind of they work kind of hand-in-hand

583
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,720
so if you find something in expose

584
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,360
you're able to more easily exploit it

585
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,650
with exploit pro with Metasploit pro so

586
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,610
those are good options there so

587
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,850
sometimes automating things even writing

588
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,950
scripts to automate some of your tasks

589
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,679
like you're in map scans there's

590
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,380
different tools out there you can use to

591
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,010
do that with like the unicorn scan or

592
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,500
magic unicorn by trusted SiC it helps

593
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,929
automate some of your tasks as well

594
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:06,650
okay they have try to see if I can get

595
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,830
my lab been running here hey Philip

596
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,240
quick question for you there's been a

597
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,420
lot of questioning and kind of clamoring

598
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,710
for any links is there anything they

599
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,690
need to download anything that we we

600
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,080
need to to get to them well what we're

601
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,860
going through this yeah I wasn't the VMS

602
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,480
aren't up there but what I'm gonna do is

603
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,960
I'm going to cover the tools and once I

604
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,780
get it uploaded then are actually what

605
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,880
we're using if you have Metasploit able

606
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,290
three setup that's what I'm using

607
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,660
Metasploit well two and three are the

608
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,690
vulnerable VMS I'm going to use so that

609
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,640
if they got Kali Linux if they don't

610
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,070
have that I know a lot of people have

611
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,350
run into trouble creating the Metasploit

612
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:55,320
3 vm it's built on Windows and so

613
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,640
there's a script out there to build it

614
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,510
with but I will share that VM later so

615
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,310
really what we're gonna do here is more

616
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,470
or less kind of give you overview of the

617
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,940
tools and then give you access to point

618
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,170
your right direction the stuff you need

619
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,530
to to practice on your own time awesome

620
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:21,660
thank you sir oh you're welcome okay I'm

621
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,580
trying to get my lab up here running

622
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,660
real quick so we can so we're not seeing

623
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,220
any only thing we're seeing on screen is

624
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,920
the end of slideshow click to exit yeah

625
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,200
that's that's fine I'm trying to give my

626
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,360
my lab connecting here at home

627
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,650
ok everybody know if you're sharing

628
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,550
desktop yeah everybody stand by for a

629
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:47,130
minute or two here well presentations

630
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,370
are the VMS up and and start showing us

631
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,610
that

632
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,900
anybody else have any questions feel

633
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,520
free to ask it here or ask it in the

634
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,270
discord Channel

635
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,410
Oh

636
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:54,600
yeah sometimes these live demos did you

637
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,490
do did you do your proper sacrifices to

638
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,040
the demo gods I don't think I don't

639
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,240
think I sacrificed enough chickens oh no

640
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,260
what we'll hope that they're not looking

641
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:12,030
today how about that okay okay yeah what

642
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,750
happened was my lab I have setup at home

643
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,820
was updating and rebooted in one of the

644
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,530
network card wireless network cards

645
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,270
wasn't working so I had to plug in a USB

646
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:25,920
wireless card to get this set up so we

647
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,840
she looks like you've made things may

648
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,740
cooperate fingers crossed

649
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,880
fingers toes whatever you need a cross

650
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,950
cross it yeah one of the things I've

651
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,640
decided in the future is to set up cloud

652
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,690
instances of stuff instead because yeah

653
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,690
I got you I got you it makes every new

654
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,750
current and never update before a demo

655
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,140
[Laughter]

656
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,570
did you put some stuff online to makes

657
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,460
it easier people have to download it so

658
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,170
there's sites like triac meaning that

659
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:09,460
you can put stuff on and people can do

660
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:30,400
it virtually online yeah

661
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,200
someone said hail to the demo gods

662
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:55,420
absolutely all right so a couple of

663
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,190
questions out here obviously nothing on

664
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,200
screen right now we know this we were in

665
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,170
the process of fixing it

666
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,250
Kali 20 20.2 has Metasploit 5.0 about

667
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,590
8.7 was a comment

668
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,300
there's also another comment here about

669
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,280
what is the YouTube channel so I'll go

670
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,650
ahead and post that into you know into

671
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,450
the lid into the link but we should be

672
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,410
able to get that to everyone as well

673
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,970
tell you what I'll go ahead and yeah

674
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,050
it's if you go to pwn school.com

675
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,990
there's a link on there for for the

676
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,920
YouTube channel

677
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,120
what is that pwn school.com cool huh

678
00:29:37,120 --> 00:30:01,840
yeah pervert okay looks like we got a

679
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,380
beam to collaborate and one of the

680
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,610
things I've kind of discovered here

681
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,820
recently if anyone's doing any any kind

682
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,650
of wireless pen testing or getting into

683
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,059
that if you're trying to get the Alpha

684
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:18,790
card to work and if it's not working I

685
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:22,300
was noticing recently preparing for a

686
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,960
pen test a wireless pen test that that

687
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,809
sans uses the Buffalo cards not buffalo

688
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:32,200
panda carts mm-hmm and so finding out

689
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,760
that these alpha cards are getting more

690
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,510
difficult to to use that the drivers

691
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,010
don't work in some of the newer ones I

692
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,900
do use like an older alpha card the

693
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,880
other day and found out also now that if

694
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,290
you're doing wireless pen testing really

695
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:50,260
pair to s is the way to go yep okay so

696
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,240
we do have a question and this course

697
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,890
would be clear we need Metasploit able

698
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,270
to slash sri and a Kali VM that's kinda

699
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,150
what you recommend me yes that's perfect

700
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,690
and as far as virtualization VMware in

701
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,820
VMware or VirtualBox works good but I

702
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,230
think one my advice to give you if

703
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,540
you're doing anything anything Wireless

704
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,470
related using VMware works a lot more

705
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,940
seamlessly when you connect your USB

706
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,550
devices it'll prompt you to connect

707
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,320
whereas VirtualBox you have to do a

708
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,760
little more work to get that to work so

709
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,530
it's an option for you then then that

710
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,260
would go with VMware but you can get by

711
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,540
Wat it I was using it for quite a while

712
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,540
without using VirtualBox and even from

713
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,220
my class at Richland College okay so we

714
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,710
can you see my screen yeah we can okay

715
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,590
one of the kind of

716
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,409
with the latest version of Kali 2 is not

717
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:23,750
working as a root user but if you get

718
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,490
tired of typing in passwords you can do

719
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,529
like I did just there because I'm

720
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,320
actually in Paris prepared for this demo

721
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,850
but yeah if you use like sudo space su

722
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,070
for switch user then you'll it'll let

723
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,549
you yet

724
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:44,120
run everything as root which you don't

725
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,440
want to do this and any other kind of

726
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,580
you're a blue team or you don't want it

727
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,600
of course you know that you won't do

728
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,809
that in your systems 1 William so we're

729
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:55,279
gonna do here is the first one we're

730
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,640
gonna do

731
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:01,340
yeah I was gonna run it I was gonna run

732
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,380
a net discovered but I'm not a map at my

733
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,669
own network over the internet so we're

734
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,159
gonna do here is we're gonna run in map

735
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,220
against our target could be the first

736
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,250
thing we do here and Metasploit will -

737
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,230
is what we're gonna be targeting and in

738
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,850
part of the reason I picked these these

739
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,929
VMs is that you're learning try to to

740
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:26,870
hack on your own but if you get stuck

741
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,450
there's walkthroughs out there so I kind

742
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,440
of encourage you to go through the

743
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,809
walkthroughs so maybe you start out with

744
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,620
with Metasploit able to work through

745
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,250
that and and if you need help you do

746
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,360
walkthroughs then we move on to

747
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,190
Metasploit well 3 try to do without as

748
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,350
much help ok sometimes you know if you

749
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,850
just don't you're not you know getting

750
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,299
it then you know seeing the way other

751
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,289
people do it and say oh so the

752
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:53,510
walkthroughs you can find multiple ways

753
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,960
of doing it so we're going to do a

754
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,490
surface scan as well and run the NSC

755
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,429
scripts I mentioned we're going to do

756
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:06,169
actually go through the tests for the

757
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,810
default scripts which is this this

758
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:13,909
syntax right here and then we're going

759
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,099
to use a script in the vault and script

760
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,859
that I mentioned is a good one for that

761
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:23,560
we're going to set the time and

762
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,849
basically I'm doing this to speed up our

763
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:27,739
skin a little bit once you say it goes

764
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:30,530
up to like t5 or t6 once you get above

765
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,389
t4 you start losing some of the

766
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,889
see you may miss something so you'd want

767
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,498
to scan too fast and then when when your

768
00:34:36,498 --> 00:34:38,569
your network scan your vulnerability

769
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:39,949
scans you want to be careful because I

770
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,589
did a pen test one time using masks and

771
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:44,059
because they were there was a huge

772
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:47,059
number of IP addresses to scan and I got

773
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,219
a little too anxious too aggressive with

774
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,319
the scans and rebooted a couple

775
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,268
firewalls so you want to be careful when

776
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:55,248
you're using masks and and also you know

777
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:56,929
kind of be careful a map especially if

778
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,049
you're testing any kind of ICS

779
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:02,539
environments your o T you know your

780
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:04,369
operation technology environments for

781
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,430
ICS so you want to be careful with that

782
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,430
you don't crash anything it's a good way

783
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,759
to get people mad at you it's kind of

784
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:18,289
funny I did a pen test one time and I

785
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:21,710
was doing my my mask scans and rebooted

786
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,809
a couple firewalls and so I got babysit

787
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:27,019
for the rest of the pen test which ended

788
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,430
up not being a bad thing because I made

789
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,539
a friend out but the guy was really

790
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:32,299
interested in pen testing so it ended up

791
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,769
making the pen test more fun because

792
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:36,019
this was a pen test that required

793
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:38,509
working after hours so I'd work from 6

794
00:35:38,509 --> 00:35:41,029
p.m. to 6 a.m. so at least it was good I

795
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:45,650
had someone to to talk to you so so we

796
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,470
got our syntax out here and so we went

797
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:55,988
out put the in map scan to a file

798
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,350
are saying they can't give you they can

799
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,680
can you Reno I can hear you I'm on the

800
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,540
phone but I don't know some other people

801
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,190
are saying they can't hear you yeah I

802
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,840
think people are gonna need to connect

803
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,010
up and out because I'm going across

804
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,040
voice over IP as well so I'm not on the

805
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,110
phone so it's it's working that way I

806
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,369
think people just need to reconnect

807
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:21,119
their sessions

808
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,940
yeah refresh browser refresh the the

809
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,530
client if you have any problems with

810
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,190
audio okay nothing they would have heard

811
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:39,360
any of what I just said so this this -

812
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,090
Oh a outputs to the three three

813
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,910
different three different popular file

814
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,220
formats for in map you get the regular

815
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,740
intimate in map output so when you cat

816
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,090
the file open up the file it's gonna

817
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,740
look like it did on the console and

818
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,840
there's the grep level format that makes

819
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,150
it easier to grip for four different

820
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,100
items within your scan it could be a

821
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,750
really long scan you need to do that and

822
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,900
then there's the XML version so with the

823
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,450
XML or pet them sorry about interrupting

824
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,030
you but a couple other people are saying

825
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,680
that hear you just fine so these are

826
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,600
individual problem if you're having a

827
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,000
problem hearing obviously you're not

828
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,980
hearing me say this but I did put it in

829
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,810
that I did put it in the in the chat and

830
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,609
I will put it in the other in there this

831
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,590
part chatham i'll stop interrupting you

832
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,350
that's okay

833
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,090
not a problem I'd rather make sure

834
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,800
people get such it situated so we're

835
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,930
gonna run our scan here against our

836
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,900
targeting this is Metasploit able to you

837
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,700
an interesting thing about in math this

838
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,230
is a pretty good tools but even if

839
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,990
you're doing your you like seat to do

840
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,350
cts sometimes cts will have information

841
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,470
on that target that you can get through

842
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,240
in map sometimes systems I don't think

843
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,670
intentionally do this but some capture

844
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,520
the flags will put information in in map

845
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,430
the in the in the system in a way that

846
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:09,090
in map is able to enumerate that so we

847
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,040
didn't set the verbosity so we set it to

848
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,760
wine so this is giving us mark okay so

849
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,670
and we just did

850
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,470
just a default scan you can do like a

851
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:27,890
full 600 and there's six 6060 360 5353

852
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,820
port all tcp ports you can do all that

853
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,490
scan all those ports and sometimes you

854
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,600
can find things you might not otherwise

855
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,680
find but just kind of for not waiting

856
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,650
being bored forever looking at a in maps

857
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,300
can and we're going to see it so we're

858
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,490
seeing silicon ports and you can also

859
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,780
add like a open tag to it so you'll

860
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,640
suddenly outputs the open information so

861
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,130
you can increase the verbosity on hook

862
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,630
to get more information as it goes along

863
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:24,109
and so if anyone's looking for a really

864
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:27,950
good book to get started in pentesting

865
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:40,280
Georgia Weidman z' book is great she's

866
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,569
working on an update and one of the

867
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:44,359
things people you know this is the

868
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:46,069
information you gain from this book

869
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:49,819
you'll still be able to to learn so it's

870
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:51,200
kind of you know the books kind of older

871
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,920
but you can still learn from you because

872
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,839
hacking a system is hacking a system

873
00:39:56,839 --> 00:39:57,799
basically you're going to use different

874
00:39:57,799 --> 00:39:59,539
vulnerabilities and different techniques

875
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:05,710
on on on your operating systems

876
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:25,510
is there a chat feature in here okay and

877
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,599
that's the book right

878
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:29,989
means that you can share that out if you

879
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:33,019
would please so that's a really good

880
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:34,880
book to get started with that's what I

881
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,309
use the first week first year of my pen

882
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,710
testing class and when I'm moving to the

883
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,809
pen test Plus later on because it gave

884
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:46,160
students say a certification to to study

885
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,470
forward to getting certification

886
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,009
certifications are good when you're

887
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:50,839
getting your foot in the door pen

888
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,259
testing you don't necessarily have to to

889
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:57,140
have certifications but it definitely

890
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,359
helps when you're getting in so we're

891
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,640
able to see you see Mattila day on

892
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,140
Harris so that's one of the vulnerable

893
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,539
web apps so there's some that's the good

894
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:07,700
thing about the vulnerable vm's like

895
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,799
Metasploit able they have so many

896
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:11,479
different vulnerabilities on there that

897
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:15,410
you're able to to exploit on there so I

898
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,809
mean it's typically what you typically

899
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,579
what you see on Metasploit well two or

900
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:21,400
Metasploit able three would be like

901
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,109
multiple vulnerable VM so this is not

902
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:26,029
gonna take up as much disk space and

903
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:27,650
you've got different things to test

904
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,249
against so you look through here so what

905
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:34,400
this that Volks script does it'll find

906
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,779
these types items right here so we're

907
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:38,029
seeing a CV for this for this particular

908
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:43,719
vulnerability so this is a diffi Helm's

909
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,569
export cipher downgrade man terminal log

910
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:54,480
jam vulnerability and so you can look up

911
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,859
and get more information this is rollers

912
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:00,240
here I believe they're actually the ones

913
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,390
that quakes this phone script so you can

914
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,280
go to this side and you can go through

915
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:20,250
and look for that vulnerability I tell

916
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,230
you what I've not really I hadn't used

917
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,720
Paris that parrot OS up into here

918
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,450
recently but it's a really really good

919
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,910
operating system especially for people

920
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,829
their privacy minded if you just want

921
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:35,609
like a an operating system to just surf

922
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:36,930
the internet and be safe it's got a lot

923
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,250
of privacy stuff built in because

924
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,619
there's just a just a standalone parrot

925
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,710
OS without all the pen testing tools in

926
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,109
it but then there's also the version

927
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:54,810
with the pen test tools in it so those

928
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:58,260
are familiar here's the exploit DB

929
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,700
exploit database we can actually go

930
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,530
through and look up our vulnerabilities

931
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,420
through that or we can use search plate

932
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,619
which I'll show you here in just a

933
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:16,790
minute so here here's a version of

934
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:25,260
OpenSSH I think they've gotten a little

935
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,030
better they may still have the CAPTCHAs

936
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:32,210
on the exploit DB website come back here

937
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,860
and so here we get it here we can see

938
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,030
the different vulnerabilities plus the

939
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,860
space this Beko so I can see what

940
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:07,760
version cuz let's then go through there

941
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,320
find your vulnerabilities here and some

942
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,710
of them if you look through a lot of

943
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,940
times you're gonna find you'll see

944
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,890
platform and we'll have Metasploit so

945
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,060
some of these are direct Metasploit

946
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,240
modules that you can find in there it's

947
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,560
many of these in here this is not the

948
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,810
exact version but you can you can see

949
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,880
the exploits you can download this is a

950
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,980
Python script so some of these require

951
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:33,260
them to be compiled so these files you

952
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,680
can download or they're actually in

953
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,060
within exploit an exploit DB databases

954
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,340
on your systems user certs plate to look

955
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:48,410
for okay so we see the different

956
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,750
platforms these run on and some of these

957
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:57,230
are PHP if some of these to show up Ruby

958
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,810
typically most cases the Ruby modules

959
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:06,100
are or for Metasploit

960
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:22,660
else here mention different file formats

961
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,740
so we see the different the three

962
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:34,640
different file formats I mentioned it

963
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,830
helps when you spell things right so

964
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:41,210
here we see what the Gripen will format

965
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:46,490
looks like so this is useful if you're

966
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,810
trying to grip through looking for

967
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,390
certain things and if you just do the

968
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:59,240
regular in map format then we see

969
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,040
exactly the output the way we slide

970
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,400
during that scan cuz this game was

971
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,800
happening and XO the XML format is

972
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,000
really handy for importing into

973
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,400
different tools because greatest is one

974
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,870
of the one of the tools out there that

975
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,570
you can it's a report generation and pen

976
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,670
test collaboration tool and you can

977
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:21,470
import all of your scans into it and so

978
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,790
you can see it's got these tags on there

979
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,200
get if you have the right kind of

980
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,930
plugins you can open it up in your

981
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,330
browser and it gives you a nice view of

982
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:35,320
the pen test or the results of your scan

983
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,790
and it's kind of color coded and stuff

984
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,650
which is kind of nice and there's some

985
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,440
tools you can some tools you can convert

986
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:50,480
it to HTML as well so like your grip

987
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,740
Abul format that's you can go through

988
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:59,930
King Brett reports so this shows us all

989
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,720
the open ports so you can get really

990
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,360
fancy with your scripting and and create

991
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,120
scripts to pull out information just on

992
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,340
certain certain protocols and stuff

993
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,810
that's so here well get this screen open

994
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:18,520
in a vulnerability here and search

995
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,660
interesting I just assumed that search

996
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:52,810
deployed would be on parrot okay let's

997
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,480
see if this has something mm they've got

998
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,740
a well just maybe they call it something

999
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:09,060
else different on here but on Cali

1000
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:18,570
and search played the name now this must

1001
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:49,560
be some kind of GUI tool ok they don't

1002
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,110
have it which is probably a way to

1003
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:53,430
install them in here and these other

1004
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,500
scripts there's some other scripts I've

1005
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,000
seen out there too they combine more

1006
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,340
than the exploit DVD together but

1007
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,840
typically what you do is just type in

1008
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:07,020
search Floyd tell you what I'll do here

1009
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,470
is I will

1010
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,230
so here you can kind of see an example

1011
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:15,869
they search boy you put in the terms and

1012
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:17,510
it will come back with a list of

1013
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,320
vulnerabilities and you're able to go

1014
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,850
through and and look those up and so

1015
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,190
it's a good idea to have this updated so

1016
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,390
when you're out on a pen test they've

1017
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,980
you know if it's kind of hard to get

1018
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,230
connection to the Internet due to the

1019
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,420
some of the controls in the environment

1020
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,210
and having that up-to-date is good

1021
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:58,210
okay here's this via FTP D backdoor so

1022
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,770
here's that there's another this is

1023
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,240
another good site this was like one of

1024
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,950
the first ones I used to use when I was

1025
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,230
getting getting started in pen testing

1026
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,320
with security focus the other on by a

1027
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:33,760
semantics okay since is Ruby it looks

1028
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,130
like it'd probably be a Metasploit

1029
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:39,119
module

1030
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,130
so we can search here in vulnerabilities

1031
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:22,750
as well so we're going to use this when

1032
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:23,890
you find an exploit you want to use

1033
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:43,599
excuse me do show options does he want

1034
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,650
to we need to make this work so need to

1035
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:50,410
our hosts so this you can do several at

1036
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:55,540
the same time so we're going to use in

1037
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,520
regardless of its one host or more you

1038
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,960
studies the our host command

1039
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,130
okay

1040
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:27,410
exploits so we need a payload for this

1041
00:54:27,410 --> 00:55:13,140
there's only one exploit completed by no

1042
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,980
session created

1043
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,920
okay so sometimes you have to try it

1044
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,619
more than once so we try to exploit

1045
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:49,500
again so we got a shell to it and so

1046
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,210
whenever you're doing the when you're

1047
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,830
exploiting a system if you can get a

1048
00:55:52,830 --> 00:56:08,310
mature professional there is okay so

1049
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,440
you're not getting so the shield that

1050
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,480
it's not interactive sometimes you can

1051
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,070
make shells interactive by putting in a

1052
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,619
string of Python code which I don't know

1053
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:18,180
if this wouldn't this would help with

1054
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,710
would allow steer that or not but CID so

1055
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,990
we see that were accessing that system

1056
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:35,940
is also a my the thing I like about I ID

1057
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,190
is when it gets the the UID it would

1058
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,080
give you like more information to group

1059
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,080
it send and stuff as well sometimes Who

1060
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,510
am I works typically on Linux system and

1061
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:49,410
so in most newer went Windows systems so

1062
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:52,950
we're able to get onto that system so we

1063
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,029
see that that is vulnerable

1064
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,730
so we're able to see the Etsy password

1065
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,190
file which years ago in UNIX and Linux

1066
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,570
they used to have like they would have

1067
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,000
the password in here too but now this is

1068
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,160
just basically shows you the different

1069
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,829
users and the groups they are in and

1070
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:34,560
where their shell starts and all that so

1071
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,390
you're able to go through it's good

1072
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,670
information if you need a you know a

1073
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,369
possible target to to exploit that

1074
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:43,020
system you know some other users that

1075
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,109
you can try to exploit so doubt this is

1076
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:48,240
going to work but we'll try it see

1077
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,540
shadow

1078
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,790
whoo so we actually get the shadow file

1079
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:12,549
so you

1080
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:14,949
take see these are the hashes these are

1081
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,890
the actual hashes of of those passwords

1082
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:21,429
so you could take these hashes and crack

1083
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:36,279
the hashes it's a lot of cases you let

1084
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,769
sometimes typically you'll have

1085
00:58:37,769 --> 00:58:39,849
sometimes you'll have access to Etsy

1086
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,009
password but not easily as a shadow so

1087
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:43,329
this would be a good one here so when

1088
00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:45,219
you're here working on this on your own

1089
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:48,670
go through and use John Ripper or hash

1090
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,920
cat and try to crack the hashes on there

1091
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,569
so I see here we found a vulnerability

1092
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:04,239
we were able to validate that it is

1093
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:06,219
vulnerable and exploit it so this is

1094
00:59:06,219 --> 00:59:08,079
where you would put your screenshots

1095
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,439
into your into your report showing the

1096
00:59:11,439 --> 00:59:13,989
access you have and who you're accessing

1097
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:21,880
as a lot of times what I like to do is

1098
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,529
to prove on the system if it's the

1099
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:25,239
command line a lot of times we'll do if

1100
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:33,489
config in there too so you have to spell

1101
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:38,949
it right so that it gives that

1102
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:40,660
information then you get to IP address

1103
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,519
associated with it so that way you can

1104
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:46,169
prove what system that you're on

1105
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,990
then while you're doing doing your pen

1106
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:56,580
test it's a good idea to use a note

1107
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,910
taping taking tool to keep track of what

1108
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:02,430
you're finding so you don't want to lose

1109
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:03,990
all this information so you may see

1110
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:06,540
something you wanted to record it so you

1111
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,830
can go back and look at it later so

1112
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,090
that's one of the reasons you want to

1113
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:19,890
save your in map output to file so let's

1114
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,390
see let's down here but there's like

1115
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:24,330
Cherry Tree and Joplin keep that was one

1116
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,280
of the older version Joplin is really

1117
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,500
nice it's pretty pretty similar to

1118
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,520
Evernote in OneNote so you could sit

1119
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,800
there and put like a in in your your

1120
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,790
notes you would create like a node or a

1121
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:41,340
folder for each each one ip's your

1122
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,260
testing and then you would take like

1123
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,050
your in map output create a note for in

1124
01:00:46,050 --> 01:01:21,300
map then there's also two we can go here

1125
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:26,460
and we'll look at it some web service is

1126
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:32,240
to ski in here okay port 80 is open

1127
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,890
sooner run nikto

1128
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,200
and so here we will see this wearing

1129
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,910
Apache to point 2.8 so you can look up

1130
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,290
and see if there's any vulnerabilities

1131
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:23,260
for that it's also using WebDAV WebDAV

1132
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:25,750
if it's not secure that allows you to

1133
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:30,820
upload files to a system so you're able

1134
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,500
to possibly upload a shell to that

1135
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,080
system and execute it or any kind of

1136
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,930
exploit code that you need

1137
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,790
so as these scans go along they're

1138
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:43,270
showing the session this PHP sessions is

1139
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:47,290
potentially sensitive information so

1140
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,520
this is Oh tell you and so you can look

1141
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,440
up this open source vulnerability

1142
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,880
database ID for that information on that

1143
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,540
and so we see that this is an outdated

1144
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,280
version so this will be something for

1145
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,740
your pen test report whether you can

1146
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,480
exploit it or not because showing this

1147
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,170
version of Apache is outdated

1148
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,910
so that says current version is two

1149
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:16,000
point four dots 4.37 so this U and then

1150
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,040
this is checking different HTTP methods

1151
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:23,560
HTTP trace and HTTP so this is there's

1152
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,720
some vulnerabilities around trace but

1153
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,400
the ones you really want to look for is

1154
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,940
your your your puts and deletes so if

1155
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,230
you can do puts and delete you can

1156
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:34,180
actually upload and delete files off the

1157
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:39,910
system also see that PHP myadmin is on

1158
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,619
there so there's probably good

1159
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:44,970
possibility that that's vulnerable

1160
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:48,849
because it's used for managing my sequel

1161
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:51,970
databases so if it's not even if logins

1162
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:53,170
not enforced you could go in there and

1163
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:55,660
possibly get some information on the

1164
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,119
system in part of a pen test - it's not

1165
01:03:58,119 --> 01:03:59,740
all about getting root sometimes it's

1166
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,109
about the information about the

1167
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:04,030
information they could be customer

1168
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:05,770
information their proprietary company

1169
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:08,080
information that you don't want to get

1170
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,540
in the hands of someone else so you will

1171
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:13,240
make sure it's protected so you know if

1172
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,250
you don't have to get domain admin to

1173
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,680
get that information that's a a or you

1174
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,810
know even administrator or any kind of

1175
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:21,160
restricted access that

1176
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,589
that's definitely a finding some credit

1177
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:25,950
card numbers personal information

1178
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,970
intellectual property that kind of stuff

1179
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:31,030
is is the gold that the malicious actors

1180
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:35,770
interact after we see some different

1181
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:39,849
vulnerabilities here so WebDAV maybe and

1182
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:41,859
there used to be there's a tool called

1183
01:04:41,859 --> 01:04:45,369
cadaver that's really good for uploading

1184
01:04:45,369 --> 01:04:48,420
files to in web dev

1185
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:17,059
another really good tool I'm not gonna

1186
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:19,880
run it here but responder is a really

1187
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,880
good tool for for collecting a sniffing

1188
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:31,400
information your your ntlm traffic and

1189
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,720
and in intercepting that and possibly

1190
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,630
cracking hashes with intercepting hashes

1191
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:50,989
such as basically a responder and so

1192
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:57,559
yeah tester l ll M&R and you can this is

1193
01:05:57,559 --> 01:05:58,970
interesting too because you can sit you

1194
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:01,069
just once you set this up on a network I

1195
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:03,079
did a pen test back a couple years ago a

1196
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:05,539
side pen test and I was able to collect

1197
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:08,660
like 53 password hashes and I was able

1198
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,579
to crack one of the hashes and what the

1199
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:12,440
hashes to you don't necessarily have to

1200
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,859
crack them you can do pass the hash so

1201
01:06:15,859 --> 01:06:17,390
several different tools like crack map

1202
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:21,249
exec that you can use to pass the hash

1203
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,980
yeah and so let me see Mattila day on

1204
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,660
here so there's a lot of good web stuff

1205
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:36,940
on here that you can you can hack on

1206
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:07,769
okay so we're able to get to this let me

1207
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:14,279
see the PHP myadmin as well we see damn

1208
01:07:14,279 --> 01:07:18,439
vulnerable web app and web dev on here

1209
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:25,259
and so you come here you actually see

1210
01:07:25,259 --> 01:07:35,699
the login for for Metasploit wall sink

1211
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:38,729
over here there's all sorts of stuff you

1212
01:07:38,729 --> 01:07:41,459
can test against so they're thinking

1213
01:07:41,459 --> 01:07:44,489
that's nice about this this Metasploit

1214
01:07:44,489 --> 01:07:45,989
Amol is you can attack this like you

1215
01:07:45,989 --> 01:07:47,609
found a system on the network it's got

1216
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:50,759
Web Services so whatever you can exploit

1217
01:07:50,759 --> 01:07:52,439
there could end up giving you command

1218
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:53,849
line access like we have through

1219
01:07:53,849 --> 01:07:55,739
interpreter so you may be able to get

1220
01:07:55,739 --> 01:08:07,679
that through the web layer and all these

1221
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:09,269
things are in you see all these apps

1222
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:10,529
they're installing here so there's a

1223
01:08:10,529 --> 01:08:12,029
good chance there's probably some kind

1224
01:08:12,029 --> 01:08:14,069
of vulnerable so you get dam vulnerable

1225
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:15,869
web app this is another good one to work

1226
01:08:15,869 --> 01:08:22,559
on your web acting skills and so you can

1227
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:27,259
see here we get the login information

1228
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:19,170
go back here and look at our version

1229
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:22,099
make sure we get the right version

1230
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:50,850
so some here you see the ranges so we

1231
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,620
tried to go directly to the version

1232
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,260
information but we scroll down towards

1233
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,150
the bottom of the page we can see that

1234
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:59,160
this is some of these could be

1235
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:04,500
vulnerable up to you'll see 3.1 now but

1236
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:09,660
there's ranges so sometimes you have to

1237
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:10,710
kind of look through because you won't

1238
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:15,380
go to the the exact version

1239
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,740
don't know

1240
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,160
I'm not a big fan of the CAPTCHAs

1241
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,210
sometimes you feel like you got

1242
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:36,900
everything in there and you just miss

1243
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,929
something

1244
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:07,589
okay now the browser's just

1245
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,230
bear with me my screen is locked-up here

1246
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:04,090
not liking this VM or the VM is not

1247
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:09,660
liking this page

1248
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:53,330
so dis cords blowing up everybody's

1249
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:55,220
totally feeling your pain right now with

1250
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,340
this CAPTCHA nightmare so just one

1251
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:00,020
there's a lot of people that are rooting

1252
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:00,910
for you

1253
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:03,230
P and they really got these things made

1254
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:05,930
I don't even good gosh these captures

1255
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:08,120
anymore just crazy that with my screen

1256
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,820
can delay I locked up yeah it's straight

1257
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,020
up torture somebody said there's

1258
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,660
probably a bus in the sky you're missing

1259
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:16,550
yeah that's just crazy I mean I don't

1260
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,880
know how I mean my gosh I guess they

1261
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,800
figure security if it's a security site

1262
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,930
they frustrate the bad guy enough the

1263
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,820
Cubs give up not hacked

1264
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,040
it's almost most secure site is one you

1265
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,750
can't get to period yeah

1266
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:12,470
you

1267
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,420
all right so just make sure one knows

1268
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,190
we're still on everything's still going

1269
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:26,660
he's just resetting yeah I have to reset

1270
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:35,930
this VM which is not going to everybody

1271
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:39,170
else knows this is real world yeah when

1272
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:42,020
you think you are gonna run into some

1273
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:44,120
weird problems let me tell you that's

1274
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,490
right I can kill you know I've been

1275
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:48,470
having a bad tech week it seems like

1276
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:54,620
anything technology wise is just being a

1277
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:57,440
challenge so there was a couple of

1278
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,790
questions out here maybe I can throw a

1279
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:00,670
couple while you're going through this

1280
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:03,140
okay there was a question somebody was

1281
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,400
having some problems with how long it

1282
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,830
took for a search boy to pop back some

1283
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:10,010
results and they were talking about do

1284
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,050
you have to use sudo when do easing

1285
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:13,580
search Explorer just didn't know what

1286
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,950
your thoughts were I don't believe you

1287
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:20,870
have to use sudo cuz I've used the newer

1288
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,510
version and the used it and it has it it

1289
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,130
could be just maybe there's just a lot

1290
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:28,250
of of information is trying to pull back

1291
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,720
that or either they may need to do an

1292
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,600
update maybe maybe the x-point DB is

1293
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,430
corrupted or something yeah I should

1294
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:37,610
miles but I would say maybe that I would

1295
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:39,470
update some see if you get there you can

1296
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:42,410
update just doing an apt update and

1297
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:46,190
it'll update everything for you gotcha

1298
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:48,800
and then one other one was specific

1299
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,990
arguments on nmap no no I know you don't

1300
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,420
have a command line in front of you but

1301
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:54,380
somebody was asking if you can go over

1302
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:56,020
what the arguments that you were using

1303
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,670
because I know she talking about the T

1304
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:00,290
for you know that you don't want to go

1305
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:02,480
much more above that because it would

1306
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,400
it's too fast and you get weird results

1307
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,200
just you know I don't know if that's

1308
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,490
something you you get there off-topic

1309
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:11,300
rather yeah TT for is is gonna be it

1310
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,640
controls the speed you can go up to I

1311
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,290
think it goes up to T 6 but once you

1312
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:18,440
start getting above T 4 then you start

1313
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,350
running into you'll start missing stuff

1314
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,390
so you don't want to miss any ports or

1315
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:26,900
anything and then the I did the - PN

1316
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,970
which is to not probe

1317
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,010
and I do that by default because a lot

1318
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:33,410
of times when you do in maps can you

1319
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:34,730
don't get information back it'll come

1320
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:37,940
back and say if you use - PN you might

1321
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:39,170
be able to find something otherwise

1322
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,060
you're not finding it so I use that by

1323
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:47,540
default - the lowercase s uppercase V is

1324
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:52,130
for the version and then the - lowercase

1325
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:54,860
s uppercase C is for the default scripts

1326
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,760
so what it does is in map as is scanning

1327
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,170
it will go through whatever services it

1328
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:03,770
finds it'll run the NMC scripts against

1329
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:05,390
that so if it's finding a lot of HTML

1330
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:07,730
related HDTV related stuff then it'll

1331
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:10,010
run more stuff against that if it's if

1332
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:11,630
it's Windows and will start throwing

1333
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:15,260
some SMB related stuff at it so that's

1334
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,780
what that that does and then the the

1335
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:21,500
script that I ran with it the - - -

1336
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:25,040
script space foam it looks for the

1337
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,540
specific vulnerabilities and gives us

1338
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,460
the open source vulnerability database

1339
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:34,010
or CVEs for those vulnerabilities and

1340
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:38,360
then - Oh a is just the adapter that's

1341
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:41,480
for the output output your go file in

1342
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,820
its lower case o and upper case a and

1343
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,470
that gives you the three formats that

1344
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:50,060
gives you the in map format groupable

1345
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:53,180
format in the XML and the XML formats

1346
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,590
good because you can import it into

1347
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,420
other tools like greatest it's one of

1348
01:19:56,420 --> 01:20:04,280
the other tools that you can do you know

1349
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,700
it's used to create reports as well as

1350
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,680
collaborate with other pen testers

1351
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:12,530
gotcha thanks for that hey welcome so we

1352
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:13,790
can go back and that's one of the nice

1353
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:16,280
things about when you run your scripts

1354
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:20,510
like if your system crashes and then you

1355
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:23,150
get your in map output so we can go back

1356
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:25,010
and look at those files as one reason

1357
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:29,150
we'll save the files and also another

1358
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:30,440
good thing too is if you're running

1359
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,970
something and you're doing a network

1360
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:35,090
pentester are using a remote system the

1361
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:37,580
screen command is good to use because

1362
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,260
what the screen does is if you're using

1363
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:42,770
a remote system your SSH to another

1364
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:45,200
remotely connected and you're running a

1365
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,800
scan and if it dies you lose everything

1366
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,450
but if you use the screen command you

1367
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:52,280
can go back and reconnect as long as the

1368
01:20:52,280 --> 01:21:01,940
server didn't crash and last one just

1369
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,090
while you're popping some stuff up what

1370
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:07,190
do you recommend is a solid methodology

1371
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:14,000
/ standard for reporting findings let's

1372
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:21,380
see this the CVV II the CVV database out

1373
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,840
there you can actually risk it rates the

1374
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,750
risks of the vulnerabilities it Maps the

1375
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,610
vulnerabilities that would be good as

1376
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:32,870
far as methodology the PETA's standard

1377
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:36,490
there but like I think it's cv cv v

1378
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:38,990
there's that that's the use of what they

1379
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:43,510
use to rake the ball bilities I get

1380
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:50,360
anything to come up clear what we have

1381
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,600
to let this sit for a while that maybe

1382
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,230
bring up a browser

1383
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:12,260
here's the book I was talking about

1384
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,680
earlier that's a good way to get started

1385
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,920
with

1386
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,130
okay

1387
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:56,370
yeah the CBS s CBS s scoring so you come

1388
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:58,350
to see ve details this is a good way to

1389
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:04,470
score rank risk your vulnerabilities and

1390
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:07,260
with the web app it's that Dolas makes

1391
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,180
it pretty nice because OWASP gets has

1392
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:15,750
that out there and say yeah you can go

1393
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:16,770
through think there's like should be

1394
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:18,150
something I heard lay you score your

1395
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:22,020
findings so there's like a seat so yeah

1396
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,240
you can use the CB CBS s score and I

1397
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,590
think version three is the latest

1398
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:31,350
version so that's a good one to score on

1399
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:33,500
that

1400
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:58,290
so what are your thoughts on how much

1401
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:00,300
networking you need to know to be

1402
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,500
successful in doing these types of

1403
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:06,690
Pentos yeah you know as far as a like

1404
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:09,060
based referred to certs and here's kind

1405
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:11,310
of a a good thing to follow if you're

1406
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:12,840
starting out new and you don't have

1407
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,750
experience 90 or technology then I would

1408
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,420
start with something like a Plus learn

1409
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,240
the operating systems and then go to the

1410
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,190
like the network plus but as far as

1411
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:25,440
networking goes mainly your targets are

1412
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,390
typically going to be servers

1413
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:30,600
workstations any kind of computing

1414
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,470
system on a network and so having a

1415
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:37,260
sysadmin level of technical ability I

1416
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:38,700
would say would be good to achieve

1417
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,620
because that means you know you're going

1418
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:42,270
on your Linux system or your Windows

1419
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:44,040
system and you're able to connect to

1420
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,590
networks and you're able to understand

1421
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,090
like basic routing so if you're not able

1422
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:50,400
to connect to a system you can do trace

1423
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,520
routes to see where you're missing out

1424
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,720
and you know some of those things that

1425
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,600
like the command line is good to know as

1426
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,130
far as like Windows and Linux because

1427
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:02,310
you get a shell to a system and you

1428
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:03,810
don't know the command line you're gonna

1429
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:05,340
be doing a lot of googling and it's

1430
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,900
gonna slow down what you need to do so

1431
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,730
if you know the command line then you

1432
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:11,790
can possibly shut down firewalls do

1433
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:13,980
different sysadmin level commands on the

1434
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,530
system but as far as networking goes you

1435
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:18,930
don't necessarily have to know Cisco

1436
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:21,420
although if you were to breach a Cisco

1437
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,880
system then it would be important to

1438
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,520
know but you know just your basic

1439
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,980
networking be able to connect you know

1440
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:32,400
systems on a network and you know set up

1441
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,680
your your network configurations on

1442
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,110
devices that you're using and devices

1443
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:41,340
you connect to so you don't have to go

1444
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:45,660
out be full-blown you know elite level

1445
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,940
Cisco you know you have to be a CCIE but

1446
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,730
just something all lines is like you go

1447
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:53,490
out to like professor Messer he's got a

1448
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:55,260
lot of videos out there and I know

1449
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:58,170
someone actually one of the best pen

1450
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:00,540
testers I know when he started out you

1451
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:02,970
know he didn't he didn't give the have

1452
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:06,150
the opportunity to take Stan's courses

1453
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:06,780
and stuffs

1454
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,060
what he did was he went through like

1455
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:10,170
professor Messer

1456
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:13,470
he built bm's was learning like security

1457
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:16,970
onion and all that's all those different

1458
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:19,680
platforms to learn networking but he

1459
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,820
went through like - professor Messer

1460
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:24,090
videos to learn networking and operating

1461
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:26,250
systems and security because you got the

1462
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:28,980
security plus a network plus you have to

1463
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,540
have those certifications but having

1464
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:35,220
acknowledges is helpful so you really

1465
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:38,190
just kind of give you you know an idea

1466
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:39,780
you know you need to be able to

1467
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,000
understand the technology to secure the

1468
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,100
technology and to break into the

1469
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,750
technology so you have to under you need

1470
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,880
to know the security and the technology

1471
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,500
and you have to know everything there's

1472
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,920
the this field is pretty broad there's a

1473
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,380
lot of things to learn but as long as

1474
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:57,090
you once you get a good base knowledge

1475
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:59,970
then you can expand those concepts and

1476
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:02,490
learn in other areas yeah that's the key

1477
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:04,470
the foundation is so crucial layer 2

1478
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:06,750
through 4 you know understanding ports

1479
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,030
understanding you know how layer 2

1480
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,100
networks will operate and some of the

1481
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,960
different protocols I mean that's that's

1482
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,220
really the the foundation that

1483
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:18,570
everything builds on yes yeah that is

1484
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:23,880
not coming back up on this so next time

1485
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,790
more chickens yeah more chickens well

1486
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:32,070
yeah I one of the things is gonna

1487
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:35,670
that'll help for next time is I'm trying

1488
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:37,410
to get away from the labs that we use

1489
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:42,600
into college where I teach and so I'm

1490
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,980
trying to get away from those because I

1491
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:46,980
have to have someone else set those up

1492
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,960
for each semester so if I want any

1493
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,580
updates to it I don't have access to

1494
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:57,020
update stuff and so I'm thinking about

1495
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:00,030
doing something putting the stuff in the

1496
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:04,380
cloud to manage myself so that way in

1497
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:07,350
that way plus I was looking at try

1498
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,060
hacked me to set up laps on the future

1499
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:11,550
then it workshops people have access

1500
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:15,570
directly to it and they don't have to so

1501
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:19,600
here's some different stuff

1502
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,910
here on some different resources if you

1503
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:24,520
go to my website there's some different

1504
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,510
books and stuff out there

1505
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:31,270
yeah like the penetration penetration

1506
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:33,280
testing a hands-on introduction to

1507
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,680
hacking I would start out with that and

1508
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,570
then like the hacker playbook

1509
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:38,830
two and three out of graduate to that

1510
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:42,160
next and with version don't skip version

1511
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,900
two because version three gets into more

1512
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,910
red teaming and you'll miss out on some

1513
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:48,390
of the network pentesting pieces there

1514
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,530
and then a web application hacker's

1515
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:52,240
handbook is great for web application

1516
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,670
pen testing and then the Red Team Field

1517
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:57,120
Manual is a good resource for different

1518
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,260
command-line syntax of stuff around

1519
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:02,860
Cisco and Windows and Linux in some of

1520
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:06,220
the different tools and these are some

1521
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:07,950
different resources I hear the first

1522
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:12,240
these first ones up here are not free

1523
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,440
but they rank from the most expensive

1524
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,360
down to lest at least expensive and

1525
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:19,240
here's some free resources especially if

1526
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,680
you're interested in bug bounties

1527
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,560
bugcrowd and and hacker one have good

1528
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,650
resources for learning web at pentesting

1529
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:30,310
and then the the sans pen test blog if

1530
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:32,230
you go there they've got cheat sheets on

1531
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:35,440
nmap so you go out there sign up to

1532
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,570
there you'll get you'll get started

1533
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:39,940
getting there their brochures in the

1534
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:42,490
mail but then you once a year they put

1535
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:45,040
out this pen testing poster and it's got

1536
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,450
like different tools or different

1537
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:48,430
techniques and stuff so that's a good

1538
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:51,280
place there of is hacking tutorials org

1539
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,410
this is a really good place for learning

1540
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:55,390
like in map and stuff like that it's

1541
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:59,440
like in map and Metasploit so here you

1542
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,670
see some of the different hacking

1543
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:03,550
tutorials so you see up here you get

1544
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:07,230
wireless yeah like Metasploit so this is

1545
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:09,340
different tutorials on how to use the

1546
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:10,450
different tools so it's a really good

1547
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:13,300
place to to learn yeah I think I think

1548
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:14,740
one of the most important things and

1549
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,060
because I get this all the time about

1550
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:17,650
people that are constantly saying okay

1551
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:19,300
well how do I start because they get so

1552
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:21,580
overwhelmed and you know I think that

1553
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,170
the the most important thing to

1554
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:24,880
understand is just don't get overwhelmed

1555
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,400
try to find a bite-sized amount build

1556
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,650
yourself a plan and start tackling these

1557
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:31,870
topics you know start small start with

1558
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:33,219
something that you can get accessed

1559
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:35,110
that's free and then start building your

1560
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:36,969
base of knowledge you know it might take

1561
01:30:36,969 --> 01:30:39,070
you a few years to get there but if you

1562
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:40,810
do it methodically you you will get

1563
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,430
there yeah

1564
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:44,320
build a home lab and that's pretty

1565
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,570
simple as running some VMs on your your

1566
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:49,600
local system or you can you know get as

1567
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,219
complex as you want but a home lab

1568
01:30:51,219 --> 01:30:52,900
getting the hands-on is good experience

1569
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:55,900
and like you said learn in small pieces

1570
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:58,210
that way you you absorb it because one

1571
01:30:58,210 --> 01:30:59,739
of the things I see a lot of times is

1572
01:30:59,739 --> 01:31:02,830
people want and that nothing is is

1573
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:05,500
planned your goals out have short-term

1574
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,910
and long-term goals if you want to be a

1575
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:08,800
pen tester I don't ever discourage

1576
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,920
anyone from not doing it because some

1577
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,719
people come up and you know they need

1578
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:17,530
you know they need a little more skills

1579
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:20,410
a little more knowledge and so I just

1580
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:23,050
encourage them because you some people I

1581
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:25,060
know that their very first job in

1582
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:27,460
security or technology was pen testing

1583
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,350
that's not going to happen all with all

1584
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,420
the time right but it can't be done if

1585
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:33,190
you want to work hard enough but it's

1586
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:35,199
you know like anything in security

1587
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,989
technology it's a marathon not a sprint

1588
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:39,160
so you just have to kind of start out

1589
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,140
and you and just continue to learn and

1590
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:43,150
you'll get there and just be patient

1591
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:45,100
with yourself to some people are not

1592
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,110
patient you just have to be patient it

1593
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,760
takes a while to learn once you've seen

1594
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:53,199
something taught several times over then

1595
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:55,540
you're going to you know next time you

1596
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:57,219
see it someone explains it different or

1597
01:31:57,219 --> 01:31:59,380
you've got a better understanding so the

1598
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,670
more times you see it the better you

1599
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:01,870
understand it so you just have to give

1600
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:03,969
yourself patience and give yourself time

1601
01:32:03,969 --> 01:32:06,010
that's exactly right you got to fight

1602
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:07,360
the burnout because that's something

1603
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,250
that we struggle with in technology it

1604
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:11,380
can seem so overwhelming but if you take

1605
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,670
it in bite-sized chunks you build

1606
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:15,310
yourself a plan you'll get there yeah

1607
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:16,949
sometimes unplug from it if you've been

1608
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:19,420
studying too hard take a break I mean

1609
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:22,090
you you see these coding challenges a

1610
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:24,190
hundred days of code that's good and you

1611
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:28,570
learn but you just can't stay busy 365

1612
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:30,310
days a year forever you've got to take a

1613
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:31,570
break every now and then or you get to

1614
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:33,160
where you hate it so you could take him

1615
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:36,090
take your breaks

1616
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:51,220
so yeah it's just yep and just build

1617
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:53,440
that base because the better you learn

1618
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,750
it the better and a good example that I

1619
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,220
can give that I'll share with my

1620
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,560
students each semester since I heard

1621
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,450
about this I know a guy that he was a

1622
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,040
reverse engineer he went to work as a

1623
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:06,280
pen tester and he took assembly in

1624
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,900
college but he just did enough to pass

1625
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:09,870
the class he didn't learn it so now

1626
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:12,070
working in the industry he had to go

1627
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:13,960
back and learn assembly oh that's

1628
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,090
awesome so it's like if he would have

1629
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,440
done it then so that's what tell

1630
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,940
students you know if they're if you're

1631
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:20,200
going through college you know your art

1632
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,140
appreciation if you're going to be in

1633
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,030
security our music appreciation may not

1634
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:27,520
help you but you know your your your

1635
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,680
networking classes your operating system

1636
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:32,230
classes your Python coding classes this

1637
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:33,430
is stuff you're going to use try to

1638
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:35,350
learn it because it's you're spending

1639
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,170
the time to do it and it'll come in

1640
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:40,110
helpful later on what do you think about

1641
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:43,560
what's your view on the best entry-level

1642
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:49,120
pentester cert ej PT or pen test plus or

1643
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,890
those those anything that you think are

1644
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:54,640
worthwhile UK PT I think is I like

1645
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,520
better because you're doing hands-on so

1646
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,050
you'll get to learn that you learn

1647
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:02,530
security courses are really good but

1648
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:03,670
yeah that would do that because you're

1649
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:04,750
gonna actually learn how to do a pen

1650
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:09,550
test your CH in pen test plus pen test

1651
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:12,490
plot the Pittman's the CH focuses a lot

1652
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:14,290
on tools and not really necessarily

1653
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:16,360
doing pen test the thing I like about

1654
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,720
pen test Plus is it gets more into

1655
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:22,000
methodology in the you know it's not

1656
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,950
just the tools which pen test plus

1657
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,840
between that you're trying to learn pen

1658
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,970
testing between pen test plus and ch

1659
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,800
you're going to learn more from the pen

1660
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:34,000
test Plus but the EJ EJ pt that's a good

1661
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,200
one to start with because you're going

1662
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,450
to learn you're gonna learn pen testing

1663
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:41,020
so you actually do you know pen testing

1664
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,370
in the course so that's that's a really

1665
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:45,130
good one to start with I've known people

1666
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:46,630
that have started out with that but that

1667
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:50,260
was their path into becoming OS CPS they

1668
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,150
started out with the j PT and then

1669
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:53,770
studied a little bit they went on to

1670
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:56,769
like the OS CP osep as it gets

1671
01:34:56,769 --> 01:34:58,150
more things I'll say - is gielo

1672
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:01,420
experience learn this before you get

1673
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:03,699
into that you'll learn rule you'll learn

1674
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:06,369
a lot in that class but there's good if

1675
01:35:06,369 --> 01:35:07,989
you don't have the basics get that built

1676
01:35:07,989 --> 01:35:09,880
up first before you start it because

1677
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,429
it's not an tree-level cert some people

1678
01:35:12,429 --> 01:35:14,710
will say it's one thing is it some

1679
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:16,420
people say it's an tree-level pen test

1680
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:17,920
but that's when you compare it to like

1681
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,769
pen test + or CH is not really but as

1682
01:35:20,769 --> 01:35:22,960
far as you know someone's experienced

1683
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,389
pen tester it's not as difficult but

1684
01:35:25,389 --> 01:35:28,949
I've seen people with you know

1685
01:35:28,949 --> 01:35:32,320
self-taught no formal education and

1686
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,510
technology do the osep and work hard on

1687
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:36,340
it and and get to it so if you're

1688
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:37,659
wanting to do that you'll have

1689
01:35:37,659 --> 01:35:39,070
experience definitely spend some time

1690
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:41,530
with the ejp key and some of these other

1691
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:44,199
courses and labs and stuff before you go

1692
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:47,170
on yeah I think the certs are very

1693
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:48,579
valuable just and just from the

1694
01:35:48,579 --> 01:35:50,739
perspective of it's a learning path you

1695
01:35:50,739 --> 01:35:52,119
know regardless of what your thoughts

1696
01:35:52,119 --> 01:35:54,309
are on certs and you know experience

1697
01:35:54,309 --> 01:35:56,320
versus third certs experience always

1698
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,590
Trump's yes are a great way to build a

1699
01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:01,420
learning path and also to be able to

1700
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,909
show you know some credibility if unless

1701
01:36:03,909 --> 01:36:05,199
you already you know have your name out

1702
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:07,329
there kind of thing yeah that's good you

1703
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:08,920
definitely go definitely helps to get

1704
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,389
you from the door otherwise it's hard to

1705
01:36:10,389 --> 01:36:11,469
get your foot in the door without the

1706
01:36:11,469 --> 01:36:13,960
cert because you got no experience you

1707
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,489
know how do you get in so usually the

1708
01:36:15,489 --> 01:36:17,590
search get in there and you know it's

1709
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:19,300
gonna depend on an employer some people

1710
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:21,190
I really haven't been seen for

1711
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:25,179
pentesting a requirement for degrees

1712
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:27,340
some people look for certifications the

1713
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:30,280
ones I hear most see most often is like

1714
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:34,360
the OSC P OSCE the Jeep in from Sands or

1715
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:38,429
the GX PN from sands in the sands GW apt

1716
01:36:38,429 --> 01:36:41,619
those once you're in it as far as entry

1717
01:36:41,619 --> 01:36:44,739
level you know CH Oh get your foot the

1718
01:36:44,739 --> 01:36:48,670
door and if companies are doing business

1719
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:50,829
with the government then you know the C

1720
01:36:50,829 --> 01:36:53,260
eh as well as like the CISSP or on the

1721
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:56,019
DMV list of certs that's are sometimes

1722
01:36:56,019 --> 01:36:58,170
your requirements to get contracts so

1723
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:00,340
having those sometimes can get your foot

1724
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:01,929
in the door it's not necessarily going

1725
01:37:01,929 --> 01:37:04,480
to help you be a better pen tester but

1726
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,190
it's a matter about getting your foot in

1727
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:09,539
the door yeah agreed

1728
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:14,840
well I'm going to give up on the the

1729
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:17,059
demo that we can just continue on with

1730
01:37:17,059 --> 01:37:18,230
questions and one has questions

1731
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:20,260
otherwise

1732
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:22,969
that sounds good so go ahead and pop

1733
01:37:22,969 --> 01:37:27,139
into the questions on the webinar so if

1734
01:37:27,139 --> 01:37:28,730
you can just queue a and pop in a

1735
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:30,530
question I'll make sure that that we get

1736
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:32,449
it answered I've been trying to keep an

1737
01:37:32,449 --> 01:37:34,159
eye on what's going on in discord as

1738
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,949
well there it was a comment in discord

1739
01:37:36,949 --> 01:37:39,469
if you're not seeing it that the EJ EJ

1740
01:37:39,469 --> 01:37:42,650
PT is actually on sale right now so

1741
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:44,599
they're offering some some discounts on

1742
01:37:44,599 --> 01:37:46,880
that so you know when and Quarantine

1743
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,579
start training in the one of the things

1744
01:37:49,579 --> 01:37:52,550
I'll say compared to because I've taken

1745
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:56,659
I've taken courses through through

1746
01:37:56,659 --> 01:37:58,190
pentester academy those are really good

1747
01:37:58,190 --> 01:38:01,520
courses and they've got stuff that fits

1748
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,889
on level they're really trying to cater

1749
01:38:03,889 --> 01:38:06,110
towards people getting started make sure

1750
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:07,969
there's are content there for them but

1751
01:38:07,969 --> 01:38:09,770
one of the things I'll say like the the

1752
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:13,070
ealer and security the EJ PT compared to

1753
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:14,960
like offensive security if you're just

1754
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,599
getting started out the pentester

1755
01:38:17,599 --> 01:38:20,150
academy snubbing the the ealer and

1756
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:21,559
security stuff goes into more detail

1757
01:38:21,559 --> 01:38:25,119
they like the OSC P so they it's like

1758
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:28,040
you know with the they've been improved

1759
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,840
on the OSC P they've added more detail

1760
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,030
to it and used to before you definitely

1761
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:33,710
even if you had experience you need to

1762
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:35,869
prep upfront before taking the class but

1763
01:38:35,869 --> 01:38:38,090
they go into a lot of good detail so

1764
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:40,280
it's like if you've got like zero pen

1765
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,540
testing experience or you don't have

1766
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:43,940
people to talk to about it it takes you

1767
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:46,280
from the beginning and explains it

1768
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:48,710
enough detail with with hands-on labs so

1769
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:49,940
it's a really good plate way to get

1770
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:53,480
started that's awesome well it doesn't

1771
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:55,550
look like I have any more questions

1772
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:57,889
popping up through here so last chance

1773
01:38:57,889 --> 01:39:01,909
guys on guys and gals on and you know

1774
01:39:01,909 --> 01:39:03,500
everyone out there please

1775
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:07,280
pop in some questions but if not unless

1776
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,880
you had something else people can reach

1777
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,010
me on Twitter I just gave you my Twitter

1778
01:39:13,010 --> 01:39:18,070
account my Twitter I might count but

1779
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:22,070
don't get me wrong now who knows what

just got on discord any advice or for

1793
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:56,370
someone finishing school in the next few

1794
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:56,760
years

1795
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,800
projects ideas to work on in their free

1796
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,220
time yeah if you're in college try to

1797
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:04,530
get see if you can get in get an

1798
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:06,330
internship because that's one thing I've

1799
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:08,490
seen it's helped people get their foot

1800
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:12,300
in the door also maybe you know bug

1801
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,040
bounties are good if you're interested

1802
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,260
in see some of the bug bounties they

1803
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,720
offer more than just web some of them

1804
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:23,840
have mobile IOT in autumn of e achill

1805
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,280
bug bounties so that's kind of a way to

1806
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,500
get started get experience but yeah the

1807
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,270
internships if you can do that that's a

1808
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:32,100
really good way to get started is the

1809
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,270
biggest thing when you're getting out in

1810
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:35,250
the field a lot of people I see that

1811
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:37,380
didn't get internships it's hard to get

1812
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:38,610
in so if you've been through an

1813
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:40,140
internship at least you've got some

1814
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,630
experience to show so look at that look

1815
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:44,640
at some of the different open source

1816
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:47,130
projects o wasp has a lot of things so

1817
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:49,800
if you want to code on that like a mass

1818
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,580
which Jeff Foley he's presenting here

1819
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:55,890
today I believe on a mass so they're

1820
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:57,120
always looking for people to help

1821
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,070
contribute to that project just like a

1822
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:03,060
wasp zap so just get out there and and

1823
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:05,580
get on Twitter and there's a large

1824
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:08,010
amount number of people from the

1825
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:09,870
community out there on Twitter they

1826
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:11,520
refer to as InfoSec twitter so it's a

1827
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,500
good place to learn yeah but yeah

1828
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,090
working on bug bounties if you work in

1829
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:17,130
if you if you got a home lab and you

1830
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:19,320
know how to hack things and understand

1831
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,580
the methodology and if you get an

1832
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:23,400
interview and you can describe that you

1833
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,780
know sometimes you can get a job when I

1834
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:27,270
got my first pen test job my background

1835
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:29,550
was I'd run boner ability scanners I've

1836
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:32,130
worked in apps SEC and network security

1837
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:33,900
had a sysadmin background so I have a

1838
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:35,679
pentesting background

1839
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:37,449
but part of what helped me is at a home

1840
01:41:37,449 --> 01:41:39,340
lab and he saw that I was willing to

1841
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:41,199
learn on my own you know a lot of times

1842
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:42,670
what people run into the corporate world

1843
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:46,510
is some people only want to learn when

1844
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:48,429
they're on the clock and they were on

1845
01:41:48,429 --> 01:41:50,199
their own companies are looking for

1846
01:41:50,199 --> 01:41:52,000
people that are there wanting to learn

1847
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,130
because you know if you enjoy what you

1848
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:55,510
do then you're gonna make a better

1849
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:56,110
employee

1850
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,270
yeah I couldn't I couldn't agree with

1851
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:00,190
that more I mean you you see so much

1852
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:01,750
more where people are looking for

1853
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:04,210
passion as opposed to an 8 to 5 type

1854
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:06,580
deal you know so there's a lots of

1855
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:08,860
different ways I mean github is a resume

1856
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:10,690
anymore you know so if you're involved

1857
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:12,550
and helping if you've got some coding

1858
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:14,500
chops and you can you know you can help

1859
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,330
to expand some of these open source

1860
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:19,270
projects it's always great things what

1861
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:20,290
do you think about the Masters in

1862
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:23,560
cybersecurity is it worth it is it is it

1863
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:25,360
good to go that direction what type of

1864
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,000
people I think people getting getting

1865
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,440
started out it may be a good idea

1866
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,730
because right now since there's a

1867
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:34,570
security shortage once industry gets

1868
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:36,699
enough people because like Ernest and

1869
01:42:36,699 --> 01:42:39,820
Young recently did away with the

1870
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,800
four-year degree requirement used to you

1871
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,900
had to have a bachelor's to work for

1872
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,219
Ernst and Young but they did away with

1873
01:42:45,219 --> 01:42:48,040
that because there's such a shortage of

1874
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:50,050
security people but I think if the

1875
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:51,880
industry ever starts to catch up where

1876
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,469
there's more people in the industry and

1877
01:42:53,469 --> 01:42:55,420
is less of a shortage then they start

1878
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,640
getting picky again so if you're one in

1879
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,170
a management it's probably good to have

1880
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:01,750
and if you ever want to teach a lot of

1881
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:04,090
that sort of uh community college yeah

1882
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:05,320
it's a requirement to have at least a

1883
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:08,770
master's yeah my thoughts are you know

1884
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:10,300
and again if you take this for whatever

1885
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:13,360
it is everybody has opinions but there's

1886
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,830
an opportunity for people to be able to

1887
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:17,380
earn some money get some experience you

1888
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:18,640
know if you went straight through school

1889
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:21,250
and only we're in the academic world and

1890
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,290
only you know ever had that level of

1891
01:43:23,290 --> 01:43:24,429
experience even getting out with a

1892
01:43:24,429 --> 01:43:27,070
master's degree you might not have that

1893
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:29,199
much opportunity unless you did some big

1894
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:31,510
projects right you might not have that

1895
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:33,790
many opportunities to get jobs so you

1896
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:35,440
know play it by ear or figure out if the

1897
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,900
masters actually makes sense but I see a

1898
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:39,489
lot of people get into college and

1899
01:43:39,489 --> 01:43:40,690
they're like you know I've gone for four

1900
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:42,909
years I'm comfortable here and I'm not I

1901
01:43:42,909 --> 01:43:44,650
don't feel like going into the into the

1902
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:46,330
big world just yet so let's get a

1903
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:48,070
masters and then they end up with debt

1904
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:49,330
so just think

1905
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:50,320
about that when you're going through

1906
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,270
your planning want to do the Masters

1907
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:54,670
here's the thing to do you know get your

1908
01:43:54,670 --> 01:43:57,100
bachelor's degree done and then go to

1909
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:58,690
work for someone have them pay for your

1910
01:43:58,690 --> 01:44:04,290
master's Amen that's right yep

1911
01:44:04,290 --> 01:44:06,490
and they'll do it a lot of companies pay

1912
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:07,420
for it and you know one of the things

1913
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:09,310
not to overlook if you're what looking

1914
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:10,660
at masters and stuff if you do like a

1915
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:14,440
masters you know and in security then

1916
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:18,040
you may do like a dual major and in get

1917
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:20,050
a MBA you because the business knowledge

1918
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:21,520
is that's important that's what the

1919
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,100
thing that I'm lacking the most whenever

1920
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:27,550
people I work with one area that I'm

1921
01:44:27,550 --> 01:44:29,530
really know nothing about is the

1922
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:31,380
business side so that's something not to

1923
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:34,210
discount either yeah that's that's a

1924
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:36,640
great point so my background you know

1925
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,530
heavy technical but I actually have a

1926
01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:40,390
bachelor's in business and I tell you

1927
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:41,860
what it has you know when you're talking

1928
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,050
a c-level if you can if you can

1929
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:46,150
translate and speak their language life

1930
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:48,130
is very different as a technical person

1931
01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:50,860
so it's almost like I put on my mask and

1932
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:54,730
go talk to them and pretend but you know

1933
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:57,310
it works right yeah and that's the

1934
01:44:57,310 --> 01:44:58,330
that's the thing because you know

1935
01:44:58,330 --> 01:44:59,530
there's a lot of time they're trying to

1936
01:44:59,530 --> 01:45:01,420
justify stuff and people with the

1937
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,520
business background you know they're

1938
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,500
able to you know they're able to write

1939
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,480
documents to justify things better they

1940
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:11,200
understand you know the business

1941
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,910
requirements better so I mean it's good

1942
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:14,920
good to have it along those lines too is

1943
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:17,110
while you're learning is make sure you

1944
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:19,150
work on your your writing skills because

1945
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:21,550
communication skills your big you know

1946
01:45:21,550 --> 01:45:23,500
be able to write properly and I mean you

1947
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:25,120
don't want to write like you're sending

1948
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,890
a text message you want to make sure you

1949
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:29,230
use proper grammar and capitalization

1950
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:31,050
and punctuation all that stuff so that's

1951
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:33,730
yeah I got into the industry without a

1952
01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:38,640
degree I was I had like what - like a

1953
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,130
Nobel netware see any training course

1954
01:45:42,130 --> 01:45:44,740
and I got into the industry and is back

1955
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:47,080
at the round the dot-com boom so they're

1956
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:48,790
looking for a lot of sysadmin folks so I

1957
01:45:48,790 --> 01:45:50,920
got in there I didn't have a degree but

1958
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:52,420
I end up later on going and getting my

1959
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:54,210
associates degree because the college

1960
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:58,390
offered credit for certifications so I

1961
01:45:58,390 --> 01:46:02,740
got credit for my mcse CISSP and even

1962
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:03,539
like

1963
01:46:03,539 --> 01:46:06,969
see Cisco CCNA so I had a bunch of tech

1964
01:46:06,969 --> 01:46:08,650
bunch of tech certs and they gave me

1965
01:46:08,650 --> 01:46:11,320
credit for it but the it was worth going

1966
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,760
back to school because English

1967
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,650
Composition learning to write I learned

1968
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:16,989
so much from that class that I've gotten

1969
01:46:16,989 --> 01:46:19,420
more out of that than anything I took in

1970
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:22,090
college that's right that's right it's

1971
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:23,739
so funny cuz on disk or people like

1972
01:46:23,739 --> 01:46:28,119
what's a CNE all those old people that

1973
01:46:28,119 --> 01:46:30,010
start out before you know before there

1974
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:31,690
was actually like programs in college

1975
01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:35,349
you know it's just so funny but yeah I

1976
01:46:35,349 --> 01:46:36,969
think I think it's different now it's

1977
01:46:36,969 --> 01:46:38,889
definitely requires that you have more

1978
01:46:38,889 --> 01:46:40,239
you know there's there's their

1979
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:41,710
credentialing but I think at the end of

1980
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:43,570
the day the experience is the key thing

1981
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:45,460
so whatever you do make sure you're out

1982
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,289
there make sure you're out there using

1983
01:46:47,289 --> 01:46:48,849
these skills you're finding

1984
01:46:48,849 --> 01:46:50,289
opportunities to intern because that's

1985
01:46:50,289 --> 01:46:52,420
what's gonna pay off the most yeah

1986
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:54,429
before I forget this too here's another

1987
01:46:54,429 --> 01:46:56,260
thing and I was about it about to forget

1988
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:59,380
about it but you know do talks go

1989
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:01,960
present at your local meetups and you

1990
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,789
know your besides conferences and stuff

1991
01:47:03,789 --> 01:47:06,849
we had a guy that at our local DEFCON

1992
01:47:06,849 --> 01:47:08,499
group the guy was a reached recent

1993
01:47:08,499 --> 01:47:10,690
college grad a hiring manager from

1994
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:13,360
Citibank was there and saw his talk on

1995
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,369
digital forensics mmm-hmm

1996
01:47:15,369 --> 01:47:18,219
he saw his presentation and asked for

1997
01:47:18,219 --> 01:47:20,979
the guy's resume and a guy got hired see

1998
01:47:20,979 --> 01:47:22,630
that's the river yeah that's exactly

1999
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:24,280
right because think about it if you're

2000
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,499
doing a pen test where's the money the

2001
01:47:26,499 --> 01:47:28,239
money is in the presentation right it's

2002
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:31,090
- it's their findings the results so if

2003
01:47:31,090 --> 01:47:32,469
you can speak and you've got those

2004
01:47:32,469 --> 01:47:34,630
capabilities you know the jobs

2005
01:47:34,630 --> 01:47:36,329
definitely are a lot easier to get there

2006
01:47:36,329 --> 01:47:39,729
yep and if you have a hard time with

2007
01:47:39,729 --> 01:47:41,800
public speaking Toastmasters is a great

2008
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:45,159
way yeah I've claimed speaker but I was

2009
01:47:45,159 --> 01:47:47,139
terrified to speak in public until home

2010
01:47:47,139 --> 01:47:49,590
with you Toastmasters I couldn't do it

2011
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:53,019
yeah no absolutely and from from

2012
01:47:53,019 --> 01:47:54,519
somebody that has a theater background

2013
01:47:54,519 --> 01:47:56,679
so I actually you know that's kind of

2014
01:47:56,679 --> 01:47:58,360
how I got started and doing a lot of

2015
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:00,340
these types of things take an improv

2016
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:03,039
class if you can actually get into a

2017
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:04,210
room and you can get in front of people

2018
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:05,619
and you can do improv and things like

2019
01:48:05,619 --> 01:48:07,210
that you know that's the opportunity

2020
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:10,389
where you can really master the ability

2021
01:48:10,389 --> 01:48:12,280
to not always feel like you either have

2022
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,320
to be saying something or that you know

2023
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:15,579
you're not able to put your thoughts

2024
01:48:15,579 --> 01:48:17,000
together in a way that

2025
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,680
can understand so all these things are

2026
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,990
great skills yeah that's that's good

2027
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:22,460
because it's interesting because one of

2028
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:24,440
the best one of the best speakers I know

2029
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:27,170
of is the pastor erection retired pastor

2030
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:30,440
for my church he was big in theater and

2031
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:32,660
he was great teller so man if you can

2032
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:35,300
and and when you mentioned the improv

2033
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,630
that's one of the nice things about

2034
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,560
Toastmasters is they have an improv

2035
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,450
portion of the meeting where they will

2036
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:42,920
come up with a subject and you got to

2037
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,660
talk on a subject for two minutes

2038
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:46,250
it could be something ridiculous or

2039
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:48,320
something you have no idea about but

2040
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,570
you've got to talk for two minutes and

2041
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:52,820
so it really teaches you to think on

2042
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:55,000
your feet so you it's not as good as

2043
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,530
taking an improv class but you kind of

2044
01:48:57,530 --> 01:49:00,500
get some of the same exposure that's

2045
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:03,050
awesome what do you look like we have

2046
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:08,060
one more question regarding programming

2047
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:09,740
languages so everybody hears about

2048
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:11,720
Python Python is really really hot right

2049
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:14,030
now what are your thoughts from a

2050
01:49:14,030 --> 01:49:17,210
programming perspective yeah Python is

2051
01:49:17,210 --> 01:49:19,310
good and I definitely would that ones

2052
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:21,080
you know it's been popular for a while

2053
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:22,520
there's a lot of libraries out there

2054
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,110
written in Python but another one as

2055
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:27,860
good as go-go Lang yeah yeah Google's

2056
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:31,100
language yeah I saw that and I've been

2057
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:34,160
taking courses on that myself and the

2058
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,260
reason I got into the programming part

2059
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:38,680
is I saw the book came out blackhat go

2060
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:42,230
and the the things about it compared to

2061
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:44,240
Python if you can compile it so you can

2062
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:47,360
it's cross-platform so you can you can

2063
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:50,630
compile it on Linux or Mac in running a

2064
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:52,960
Windows so you can cross compile it on

2065
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:55,400
an operating system that's not going to

2066
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,800
run on to run a Windows if you're doing

2067
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,050
you guys need to write something then

2068
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:01,970
you can compile it to run on Windows

2069
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:05,060
so golang is pretty big I mean better

2070
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:07,340
cap is written it's a man the middle

2071
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:10,070
tool it's written and going a mass is

2072
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:13,490
written and go Jeff Foley is a big fan

2073
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:15,950
of it the creator of a mass mm-hmm so

2074
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:19,880
that's when Python or going yeah rust is

2075
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:22,100
also really really getting popular so

2076
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:23,720
you know if you're kind of on the

2077
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,760
cutting edge rust is really starting to

2078
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:28,250
make make its itself known because of

2079
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:30,320
the just the inherent memory

2080
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,270
security so a lot of the things that we

2081
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:34,160
do from a buffer overflow perspective

2082
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,620
rust has a lot of things built into it

2083
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:39,530
as a language that you know help to to

2084
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:41,060
protect against a lot of that stuff so

2085
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:43,550
worth looking at but definitely the most

2086
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:47,450
popular would be Python go JavaScript

2087
01:50:47,450 --> 01:50:50,720
and and you know standard you know HTML

2088
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:52,970
knowing those types of things also helps

2089
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:54,260
especially if you're doing any pin

2090
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:57,380
testing on you know websites or you know

2091
01:50:57,380 --> 01:50:59,240
those types of platforms it really just

2092
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:02,120
kind of depends and then once you learn

2093
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,100
learn how to code or learn a little bit

2094
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:06,260
about it when you a lot of times you'll

2095
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:08,240
get exploit code and if you have to run

2096
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:11,390
it sometimes you have to alter it so

2097
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:13,670
understanding you know just to be able
