00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,979
No thank you for joining Krusty I really

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,350
appreciate it we're online thank you

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,180
thank you thank you Omar good morning

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,700
good afternoon and good evening to

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,110
everyone I welcome to jungle and I

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,240
wanted to extend my appreciation thanks

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,449
to the red team village and Cyber Texas

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,740
Texas cyber today we are going to be

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,010
looking and what you need to know in

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,830
order to be effective mitigating some

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,480
enough service attacks but more

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,390
importantly to be able to interact with

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,239
other teams and companies that that UB

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,230
would be used to help you with us just a

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,390
brief introduction I am currently

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,670
graduate student at Purdue University I

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,230
am focusing on cyber security mostly in

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,660
the space of country challenges

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,050
techniques and enforce operations but I

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,620
used to do the loss mitigation for many

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,829
years including as a part of my previous

22
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,369
job right before I came to school

23
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,590
currently I also work for the cyber

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,229
theft program which is a program within

25
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,570
Purdue that provides help to local

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,460
businesses within the state of Indiana

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,920
for we do that without any cost for

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,830
those businesses so that's pretty much

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,409
it if you need to contact me at the

30
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,409
bottom of the screen my two emails you

31
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,780
can see more about me on my LinkedIn

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,259
profile and that's pretty much it now

33
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,869
one thing I would like to also ask you

34
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,570
is if you have any questions please send

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,400
them to the track three briefings

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,680
channel I will be monitoring this

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,649
channel and I will try to either

38
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:47,970
directly answer the question or

39
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,149
incorporate the answer in the current

40
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,710
narrative of the slide that I'm covering

41
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,890
so don't be shy ask questions this

42
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,380
always goes better because also when I

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,119
see the questions I can tune and kind of

44
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,619
figure out where the audience is I

45
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,229
obviously do not have the visual cues to

46
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,810
see how people responding so that that

47
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,840
helps me as well so without further ado

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,920
what is DDoS any brave souls let's

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,590
who can use this cord all right it looks

50
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,099
everybody is very shy so in general this

51
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,099
is a resource exhaustion many people

52
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,590
think about in our service is an

53
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,830
overloaded pipe which in some cases is

54
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,319
correct but it doesn't need to be that

55
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,620
way in many attacks you may actually see

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,270
decrease in traffic on a particular

57
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,550
network connection as a result of the in

58
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,030
a service attack so in general this is

59
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,700
going to be a resource exhaustion which

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,950
is going to in turn lead to lack of

61
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,819
availability now this is also very

62
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,950
interesting to mention because this is

63
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,230
very similar to having a small website

64
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,410
being advertised or highlighted only

65
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,530
much larger media platform and then

66
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,060
suddenly this website gets so much

67
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,069
traffic that they are unable to serve

68
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,569
that traffic so it will kind of feel the

69
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,120
same way to that small website being

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,350
overwhelmed by the incoming traffic now

71
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,730
having said that this also may appear

72
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,940
like an outage and again this is kind of

73
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,459
interesting to look at because many

74
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,380
people perceive DDoS is this magic thing

75
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,910
that happens and nobody can do anything

76
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,579
about it but we already have a ways to

77
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,470
deal with a lot of traffic with an

78
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,630
outage and so on so we kind of look at

79
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,980
how to apply those in this space so from

80
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,810
security point of view the nav service

81
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:50,400
would be what any guesses okay let's

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,350
distribute and what is security from

83
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,700
security point of view how would you

84
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,530
classify a dinner service attack

85
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,540
okay let's really go and look into the

86
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,239
CIA triad so what do we have there we

87
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,310
have confidentiality integrity and

88
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,969
availability so from security point of

89
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,769
view we are going to be breaching which

90
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,430
one of the t it would be availability so

91
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,120
DDoS is a security event though it is

92
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,009
not the one the type of security event

93
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:23,800
were used to talking about many people

94
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,960
were talking about breaches data leaks

95
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,729
and so on however this case we have we

96
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,949
have decreased availability now from

97
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:35,349
operations point of view this would be

98
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:38,229
an outage and as I mentioned a few

99
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:40,060
minutes ago it is very important to

100
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,789
realize that because operations people

101
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:45,789
for many many years have figured out how

102
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,740
to do with outages build redundancy

103
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,870
distribute traffic and so on so it's

104
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,940
very important as a security person to

105
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,530
be able to interface with your

106
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,919
operations team and be able to use

107
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,720
whatever resources they can offer when

108
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,389
you're dealing with this type of event

109
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:06,490
from business point of view this is

110
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,099
financial loss and why is that important

111
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:12,699
well if you want to prepare your company

112
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,620
to do within our service attacks you

113
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,530
will need to have a budget and how do

114
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,180
you justify that budget to your

115
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,190
management Wow

116
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,659
you have to know how much money the

117
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:25,060
company will lose when an adverse event

118
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,940
occurs so the first the most important

119
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,650
question you need to ask your management

120
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,380
is how much money are we going to lose

121
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,729
if the website is down for one hour or

122
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:39,550
for one minute or for one day depending

123
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,940
on your type of industry and hopefully

124
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,080
they'll be able to give you this

125
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,270
information but unfortunately most of my

126
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,580
experience people have not been able to

127
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,349
give to provide that information so the

128
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,690
first task there is to work with

129
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,520
executive management to see how much

130
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,280
they value the website what value do

131
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,830
they assign for one hour of outage now

132
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,990
once you have this information you need

133
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,669
to look at the company profile and the

134
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,080
probability of the company being

135
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,090
attacked and then you can more easily

136
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,389
justify budget to invest in dinner

137
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:11,919
service mitigation

138
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,680
excellent I'm just catching up with the

139
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,110
channel okay so really briefly just for

140
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,189
semantics what is the difference between

141
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:21,219
Delos and dinner absolutely and just

142
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:24,129
dinner service so distributed versus not

143
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:28,449
distributed all right when we have just

144
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,650
dinner service we have an attacker and

145
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,569
there is only one source of that traffic

146
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:37,629
that is hitting the target many many

147
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,909
years ago same food was very popular now

148
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,499
funnily enough Sanford is still popular

149
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:44,289
but it is not as effective as some of

150
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,210
the other attack types but many years

151
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,310
ago you would only have one single

152
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,139
machine over a modem and it would be

153
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,050
able to dinner service a cup of servers

154
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,650
here were talking like 25 years ago

155
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:02,069
nowadays things are not st vo but if we

156
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:04,300
look into this picture we're going to

157
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,979
see the next generation so we have a

158
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:09,310
distributed attack where we have an

159
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,020
attacker that is controlling a

160
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,539
commanding control server and now the

161
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:15,639
command control server who issue

162
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,759
commands to bots and then the traffic is

163
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,250
going to be coming from many different

164
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,219
sources and just a quick note here I am

165
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,199
realizing that maybe the video streaming

166
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,860
is delaying the video that the delivery

167
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,899
of video so I will try to ask the

168
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:33,610
questions a little bit early and provide

169
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,169
a little bit more time for the answers

170
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,729
because I'm seeing your answers coming

171
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:38,830
like 10 seconds after I have passed a

172
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,779
topic so just not in noting this so yeah

173
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,909
here you have multiple sources of the

174
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,659
attack that are going towards the target

175
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:52,810
well here we have a botnet but we can

176
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,139
also achieve the exact same result using

177
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,210
reflective attacks where we have number

178
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,039
of reflectors and all of those

179
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,289
reflectors are sending traffic towards

180
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,599
the victim so this again is distributed

181
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:08,199
denial of service attack any questions

182
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,349
so far

183
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,469
ok so why are we seeing so much DDoS

184
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,379
lately is it just marketing or is it

185
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:24,610
objective well there is a couple of

186
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,879
things that are going on right now first

187
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,150
we have Moore's law and according to the

188
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,099
Moore's law we're going to have two

189
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,049
times more transistors on the same

190
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,010
square footage of a die or square

191
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,078
you know centimeter square and so on on

192
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:44,290
a die every 18 months open with' doesn't

193
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,390
grow as fast but approximately every 2

194
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:46,779
years

195
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:49,450
our depend with or the connections

196
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,180
between different points doubles which

197
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,579
in turn means that we'll be able to

198
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:57,070
carry more bit more traffic towards a

199
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,700
victim one of the things that is not

200
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,190
understood very well is that if somebody

201
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,579
has a large botnet and can generate a

202
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,160
lot of traffic at the point of each of

203
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,860
those drones that doesn't mean that they

204
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,990
will be successfully able to deliver all

205
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,240
this traffic to the target think about a

206
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,149
giant botnet within China that is trying

207
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,269
to attack something in let's say Japan

208
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,339
well they have to go through the great

209
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:25,810
China Farrow which is going to be a

210
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,029
limiting factor for that bandwidth so no

211
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,399
matter how big the botnet is also the

212
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,019
fabric that is going to deliver this

213
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:35,470
attack is in play so in a little bit

214
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,649
less extreme if you're trying to attack

215
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:43,240
somebody in let's say in Europe and you

216
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,920
have botnet in Europe you obviously will

217
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,810
probably be able to deliver most of that

218
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,610
attack traffic to the victim if it has

219
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,649
to go to some transatlantic lanes maybe

220
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,779
that will shed off some of the traffic

221
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,930
cuz it will be dropped because it's over

222
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,230
over over learning some of the links or

223
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,480
if you have for example a botnet that is

224
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,160
focused in a particular home provider

225
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,589
those are very quickly going to exhaust

226
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:10,990
the upload bandwidth for that provider

227
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,510
so the full scale the attack is not

228
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,040
going to be delivered to the target is

229
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,740
going to be filtered at the go through

230
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,430
the source so by having more available

231
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,190
bandwidth on the Internet this enables

232
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,350
more of the attack traffic to be

233
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,300
transported this is why we are able to

234
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,050
see what more a lot bigger attacks now

235
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,470
this also provides as the Internet is

236
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,029
growing there's more devices that can be

237
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:38,230
exploited and also the

238
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,110
devices can send at higher bandwidth so

239
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,420
when somebody brags about a really big

240
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,370
attack this is not that important

241
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,320
because those numbers will continue

242
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,570
growing and that's just the way the

243
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,730
world is however what's important is

244
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,130
what percentage of the bandwidth of the

245
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,610
target or particular resource that is

246
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,580
being exploited has been consumed and

247
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,320
what is their overhead that they can

248
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,100
continue operating in now reflectors is

249
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,080
one of the other factors so about five

250
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,870
six years ago zero after the 2013

251
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,060
attacks against the US financial

252
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,000
industry reflectors became very popular

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,280
so different attacks using reflectors

254
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,680
were introduced for now I'm just going

255
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,630
to mention that UDP is extensively used

256
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,220
in those cases and some of the

257
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,500
properties of UDP but those can also go

258
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,630
over TCP and we'll go in more detail a

259
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,440
little bit later the next few are IOT

260
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,170
devices content management systems the

261
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,510
the creation of so called booters or

262
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,700
stressors and the access to information

263
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,680
so let's look in more details in those

264
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,490
for home routers and IOT in general just

265
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,830
having a lot of those devices that some

266
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,240
of them come with default usernames and

267
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,570
passwords some of them have an inclusive

268
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,380
DNS resolvers open on the internet

269
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,050
interface also bugs in those devices in

270
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,940
some cases they have network diagnostic

271
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,200
tools that are accessible without

272
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,110
username and password and can be used to

273
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,390
send a to send traffic by let's say

274
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,690
sending a large sized ping packets and

275
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,160
so on so that's one of the challenges in

276
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,240
particular attacks here army Rai in 2016

277
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,680
then we had a bunch of derivatives from

278
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,890
the hcg author of Centauri got sentenced

279
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,610
yesterday

280
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,520
no on Thursday on Thursday so this was a

281
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,020
long long thing of issues coming from

282
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,260
embedded devices and we have seen where

283
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,380
one of those now compromised content

284
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,810
management systems those were actually

285
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,580
very popular

286
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,649
around 2013 when they were mostly used

287
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,410
against some of the attacks against the

288
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,839
financial industry those are still

289
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,730
popular but not as much as compromised

290
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,339
embedded devices or IOT as we call them

291
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:02,440
nowadays yep

292
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,690
so booters and testers this is another

293
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,060
interesting phenomena because they are

294
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,360
not bringing anything conceptually new

295
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,050
from technical point of view however

296
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,560
they lowered the bar of using dinner

297
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,500
service attacks those those services

298
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,200
came around were emerged around the

299
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,329
gaming industry online gaming industry

300
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,010
where people would play a game and they

301
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,010
would need to put somebody off the game

302
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,810
for example they're doing a world of

303
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,990
warcraft raid or you know League of

304
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,630
Legends and so on those are usually

305
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,820
short interactions they don't need the

306
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,829
person to be offline for more than 3 or

307
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:48,040
5 minutes and this is how those services

308
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,790
have also shipped their offerings they

309
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,980
the attacks usually are very short-term

310
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,130
5-10 minutes maximum they can range

311
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,079
between 5 to 10 gigabits in some cases

312
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:03,270
we have seen going after 40 gig but it's

313
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,100
basically they they are fairly low

314
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,690
resource attack to execute and they

315
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,370
cause a lot of disruption because you

316
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,490
can see how how high they can go also

317
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,279
when they're attacking home modems there

318
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,690
there are certain things around the

319
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,430
oversubscription of home lines and so on

320
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,480
which causes a lot of problems and

321
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,820
because they are very very cheap it is

322
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,490
very easy for people to pay $50 and

323
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,620
launch as many attacks as they want to

324
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:40,060
any questions so far so I wanted to kind

325
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,940
of look at the monetary side of or the

326
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,690
the cost of reflection and then we start

327
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,490
going more in more technical things so

328
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,380
if in the past I wanted to execute an

329
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,860
attack I would need to have a command

330
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,170
control server which I would probably

331
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,760
as an attacker would probably buy with a

332
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,930
stolen credit card but I also have to

333
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,250
preferably get it in a bulletproof

334
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,260
occasion so that the data cannot easily

335
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,209
be seized and so on so that's one

336
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,389
expense then in order to run this attack

337
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,980
I would require a large network of

338
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,490
drones that will be sending this traffic

339
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,760
so what does that mean I would have to

340
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,600
either pay for those two something like

341
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,149
paper in stone I think two three years

342
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:32,709
ago when I was lovingly searching the

343
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,560
space thousand hosts in the US would

344
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,630
cost about hundred and forty dollars for

345
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,240
paper install I pay somebody hundred

346
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,339
forty bucks dings two thousand copies of

347
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,589
my malicious software that can execute

348
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,199
those attacks and now he'll give me at

349
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,940
least see if I can pay that money to

350
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,980
have something installed on those

351
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,779
people's machines why would I be wasting

352
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,240
my time with didn't have service when I

353
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,860
can be stealing credit cards for example

354
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,680
but again just kind of looking at the at

355
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,680
the cost of executing attacks the old

356
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,820
way then the next thing is you know I

357
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,100
can have the attack now also from legal

358
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,240
point of view actually there's one thing

359
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,699
I wanted to mention here is that for all

360
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:14,860
those machines that are compromised this

361
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,970
is a federal statute violation and it is

362
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,589
you know I can be charged with that

363
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:22,240
potentially so I have also legal risk

364
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,040
which adds to the cost this is a

365
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,019
deterrent for the attackers the other

366
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:29,070
thing is having a centralized C&C is

367
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,390
basically creating this dynamic where I

368
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,970
can easily be wiretapped and data can

369
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,529
also be collected if somebody can get

370
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,300
their hands on the CSV they can get a

371
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,890
lot of information about me and what

372
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,160
attacks I was queueing and also what you

373
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,810
know what the targets were in stone so

374
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,720
there are a lot of downsides of using a

375
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,279
botnet to disc you dinner service

376
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,750
attacks now if we look at deflectors we

377
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,510
have another dynamic those machines that

378
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,310
reflect the attacks are not compromised

379
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,930
they're just misconfigured and they're

380
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,279
not misconfigured by the attacker

381
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,790
they're misconfigured by the owner so

382
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,040
all the attacker does is they're sending

383
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,919
some trigger traffic that is going to

384
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:12,849
trigger in

385
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,949
much bigger response going to the victim

386
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:17,980
not saying this is legal but there is

387
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,339
far less footprint that the attacker is

388
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,140
leaving and there is far less traces of

389
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,049
what they did the other thing is that

390
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,270
also they don't need to have a

391
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,210
centralized control server now in many

392
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,730
cases they may get the attacks from a

393
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,500
server that's in a Caucasian but again

394
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,080
it's not a C&C server per se and it can

395
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,789
be moved very quickly now the other

396
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,679
thing that the attacker needs is a list

397
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,400
of reflectors those go fairly cheap in

398
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,799
your online forums and also that are

399
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,750
very easy to create you can just start

400
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,710
scanning the internet see well what mode

401
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,630
systems are responding to those queries

402
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,549
and build the list yourself now there's

403
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:58,900
some other shukri are including those

404
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,460
lists but this is more on the offensive

405
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,150
side doesn't pertain to defense so

406
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,049
questions so far

407
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,110
you

408
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,970
okay so just in a couple words the

409
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,880
motivation of attackers is very very

410
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,690
wide range and they range from script

411
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,920
kiddies to people that do this

412
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,990
professionally and are going after a

413
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,780
particular goal disrupting the

414
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,250
availability of particular resource

415
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,110
maybe to consume another operation or

416
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,210
something along those lines so the range

417
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,330
of attackers pretty wide motivation same

418
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,850
story very wide could be anything

419
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,890
anything could cause this including

420
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,420
somebody upsetting somebody else in high

421
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,780
school or somebody playing a game and

422
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,660
making inappropriate comment or comment

423
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,400
that is perceived as inappropriate by

424
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,470
somebody and they can launch an attack

425
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,280
so there's a bunch of motivations there

426
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,740
now I want to look a little bit more at

427
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,330
the booters because they're the plague

428
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:09,450
of modern DDoS society this as I

429
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,700
mentioned earlier started about five

430
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,430
years ago most of the attacks that

431
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,860
they're using a reflective italics just

432
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,640
because it's easy to get to get those

433
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,250
going you don't have to have a lot of

434
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,630
the botnet you don't have to affect

435
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,520
machines you don't have to be skilled as

436
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,060
a matter of fact you can buy a kit for

437
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,650
5200 you know five hundred dollars and

438
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,860
then in some cases free and just install

439
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,450
it on a VPS and then profit as I

440
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,270
mentioned short bursty Elementary's

441
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,830
limited scripts in many cases now what

442
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,150
do they do on the front end when they

443
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,160
sell those the tags this is what some of

444
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,810
the panels look like this is what

445
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,640
pricing models are like he conceded

446
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,090
there you know someone speculative who

447
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,340
would buy VAP ultimate right thousand

448
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,650
bucks I don't think so

449
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,390
now what's also interesting is that we

450
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,570
have the same operators sometimes

451
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,670
operate multiple front ends to the same

452
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,930
infrastructure on the back in one of the

453
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,490
cases this was just because the person

454
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,100
had very bad service so he basically was

455
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,620
monetizing the the capability multiple

456
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,220
time

457
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,320
first people go by service from one of

458
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,330
the places then they get upset could it

459
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,160
is because it's not very high quality

460
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,020
then they'll go to the other one and

461
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,180
because those were very low like fifteen

462
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,860
twenty to fifty dollars a month most

463
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,470
people will not even complain and ask

464
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,510
refund or even if they ask refund they

465
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,000
would not get but this was a way to

466
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,070
monetize this the other reason for code

467
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,540
you use is just because those are kids

468
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,980
that are just sold between Caminos and

469
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,390
more distributed between criminals and

470
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:59,840
this is why we see the same at the same

471
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,430
basically panel you can see here those

472
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,810
two just basically have different

473
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:13,830
colored color schema questions now one

474
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,270
interesting thing about the booters

475
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,190
while you're typing questions is what

476
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,550
are the teenagers have the perception or

477
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,980
at least have justification believing

478
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,040
that this is not illegal and that

479
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,750
obviously is not the case because we

480
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,030
have seen many of them so far being put

481
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,220
in jail

482
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,260
but I think it's also important to be

483
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,300
able to spread this message in and

484
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,580
basically make sure that younger people

485
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,400
understand that this is this is very

486
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,990
illegal DN C a red ran an ad on hack

487
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,900
forums for several months and they did

488
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,260
measure decrease in attacks just because

489
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,900
of this awareness campaign that they

490
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,510
were running also the heck forums admin

491
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,800
was cooperative and they pinned the the

492
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,680
announcement that the NCAA had put

493
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,760
explaining that this is an illegal

494
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,710
activity and for the ones that don't

495
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,930
know what NCA is and she is the British

496
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:21,390
equivalent for our FBI okay so looking

497
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:27,060
at the attacks seem fun so what is the

498
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,680
sim four

499
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,450
exploiting it is explaining the

500
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,160
so-called three-way handshake and I

501
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,750
think everybody here knows what a to a

502
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,270
handshake is but I'm going to go over it

503
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,100
very briefly just so that I can you

504
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,650
state certain points so the client will

505
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,680
send a packet which you have the

506
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,150
synchronization bit on and this would be

507
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,860
a signal for the server that this

508
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,220
acknowledgement number here is not valid

509
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,600
just because there's nothing for this

510
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,460
client acknowledge what's also

511
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,690
interesting is that there is going to be

512
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,520
this sequence number now the sequence

513
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,440
numbers are fairly large I'm using small

514
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,910
numbers just because we're human and

515
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,530
don't do very well with large numbers

516
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:07,160
now the server will store the sequence

517
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,720
number and a bunch of other properties

518
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,430
in this storage pianet here in this

519
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:18,980
queue and would then respond now note by

520
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,510
definition it's going to increase the

521
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,670
acknowledgement number sorry it increase

522
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,860
the sequence number by one and this is

523
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,660
going to be the acknowledgement so it's

524
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,190
acknowledging this sequence number here

525
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,520
and then it's going to create its own

526
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,550
random sequence number many years ago

527
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,260
those were not very random if you

528
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,760
remember the kevin Mitnick exploit

529
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,390
against numerous machine he used the

530
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,900
fact that at the time the terminal was

531
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,300
not generating random sequence numbers

532
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,780
so he was able to predict the range in

533
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,820
within which he had sent the following

534
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,730
packet to make the machine believe that

535
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,780
there was a to a handshake had

536
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,810
established so having said that don't we

537
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,370
have the sequence number and it is key

538
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,040
for our purposes and we'll see why in a

539
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,830
second now the third packet too close to

540
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,580
a handshake

541
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,290
obviously acknowledging this sequence

542
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,000
number five fifty here five fifty plus

543
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,770
one and then the sequence number

544
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,650
continues to be one one plus one because

545
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,510
there is no date we're sending there's

546
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,940
not enough so there's nothing we need to

547
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,620
increase if we were to send some data

548
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,600
this number here will increase but

549
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,140
remember this thing here 101 is

550
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,610
something that the server is going to

551
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,790
use to make sure that this packet and

552
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,500
all the properties that are stored here

553
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,900
like store source IP destination IP and

554
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,990
TCP options and so on and the sequence

555
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,230
number match see

556
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,570
number obviously will be with one-pass

557
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,669
but that's you know very easy to

558
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:48,299
subtract so what does the attacker do

559
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:52,530
and the attacker will exploit this very

560
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,870
storage unit here when they send a lot

561
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,890
of packets this storage unit is going to

562
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,919
be overloaded and the moment it sends

563
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,880
another packet out that is at the end of

564
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,160
the cube it's just not going to accept

565
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,580
it

566
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,750
so basically the attacker all they need

567
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,320
to do is send a bunch of packets now why

568
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,530
am i using random IP addresses here from

569
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,270
the attacker side why am I not using the

570
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,850
attackers IP address or just a specific

571
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:29,250
IP that maybe somebody else

572
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:37,630
okay so if I was the defender and if I

573
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,280
see the same ip address sending me all

574
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,809
this malicious traffic I can very easily

575
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:45,429
drop this traffic and that will be very

576
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:47,440
easy to defend this is why the attacker

577
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,300
needs to use random numbers here so that

578
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,520
the server server side cannot

579
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,740
distinguish which one is attack traffic

580
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,960
versus legitimate traffic now what are

581
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,900
we going to do to defend this

582
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,289
just a little bit details when the

583
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,460
resets would be returned but I think is

584
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,299
that we have a queue size in this queue

585
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,730
size in criminal for 18 is hundred

586
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,820
twenty eight entries before that it was

587
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,799
up about 1 K 2 2 K but let's think about

588
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:33,070
this if I send a packet which is

589
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,760
actually done let's do the calculation

590
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,159
on the next slide it this is what I have

591
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,049
it broken down so how much bandwidth do

592
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:42,529
I need to keep 1 1 Q saturate it so

593
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:46,100
first let's use backlog size of 1000

594
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,929
here I'm intentionally increasing it

595
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:51,350
just to demonstrate how more vulnerable

596
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,820
the server's actually are to this type

597
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,809
of attack now the backlog as in the

598
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:01,460
sieve timeout is 60 seconds and since

599
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,539
it's 60 seconds I need to send 1,000

600
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:08,480
packets every 60 seconds to keep this

601
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,799
queue full right what is the same packet

602
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,720
size so the smallest legal packet would

603
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,059
basically be determined by the size of

604
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:23,690
the frame so we can only have 64 byte

605
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,620
frame on Ethernet you cannot have

606
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,330
anything smaller than that the end

607
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,950
that's for historical reasons from tin

608
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,200
net and the timing and collision

609
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,570
detection and so on but you have 64 byte

610
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,120
frame then you have 20 bytes inter

611
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,950
packet gap so this is the timing between

612
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:45,049
frames and basically you can you you can

613
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,059
say that one packet with syn flag on

614
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:52,190
will be 84 bytes so if I want to send to

615
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,789
saturate this server all I need is to

616
00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:01,490
send 16 packets per second which x 60

617
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,769
second basically will exceed this 1000

618
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:06,980
or this is 1 point 4 K in order to

619
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,779
saturate one server that has thousand

620
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,909
slots and as you as I mentioned in the

621
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:12,380
previous slide the current kernel by

622
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,730
default has only come to 28 slots so

623
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,049
let's law let's think what will happen

624
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,509
if I lower the timeout or

625
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:23,089
increase the backlog so if I lower the

626
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:25,909
time out if I lower it to 30 seconds

627
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:27,649
that means automatically that my

628
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:31,129
attacker will have to send 2.8 cubits

629
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:32,629
well no problem right

630
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:37,279
still on GSM version 2 2 G that's only a

631
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,199
third of the bandwidth available to the

632
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:43,639
2g phone let's go down to 10 seconds so

633
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,739
this is 6 times this number again

634
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:48,440
it's too very little this is the 9600

635
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,679
that both that the 2g modem without edge

636
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,349
or any extensions can do it still very

637
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:57,759
low or if I go to 1 seconds then we

638
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,999
increase this by 60 and we have suddenly

639
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,909
90k one who cares right 90 K is nothing

640
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,849
modern-day so obviously this is not

641
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,679
going to help us much now the other

642
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,149
problem we have is that the moment we

643
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,249
stop going below 2 seconds we're going

644
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:14,839
to start dropping large amounts of

645
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,399
legitimate traffic the moment we go

646
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,039
after below one second or one second

647
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,239
that means we're going to be losing a

648
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:22,639
water legitimate ones so this definitely

649
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:24,469
is not a wait for us to go and mitigate

650
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:27,829
similar logic with the backlog doubling

651
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:30,019
the bet backlog only requires the

652
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,849
attacker to double this number which

653
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:33,589
again is not going to help us much

654
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:35,839
because we run out of memory or the

655
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,879
ability to scan that table efficiently

656
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:40,609
before the attacker runs RF bandwidth on

657
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:45,589
a home cable modem now how would this

658
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:48,229
attack look like on the receiving end

659
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:50,059
what the receiving end is going to see a

660
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,669
war of sockets in sin receive state this

661
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:54,049
is how they they're going to know that

662
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:56,749
they have a sim foot and they will

663
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:59,389
usually be on the same target well not

664
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:01,009
usually they will be on the same target

665
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,139
port which is being attacked and they'll

666
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:04,940
be coming from all kinds of foreign IP

667
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,709
addresses here I'm simulating this on in

668
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,539
a virtual machine that's why it's 120

669
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,169
it's a local host now how do we mitigate

670
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:14,779
this so we obviously saw that we saw

671
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,259
that obviously queue length and timeout

672
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:21,009
is not helping us solve this problem

673
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:24,199
well there were certain things we needed

674
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:27,859
to preserve in the packet the first

675
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,359
packet that the client sends to the

676
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,690
server that go into this storage unit on

677
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,070
the

678
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,570
right side of the silver if you remember

679
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,740
so if we take those key elements like

680
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,450
source IP destination IP source port

681
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,590
destination port and select options and

682
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,929
then we also add a timestamp just so

683
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,360
that we can protect ourselves from

684
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,639
replay attacks we can take this

685
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:54,909
information and we can hash it and get

686
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:57,669
this 24-bit hash remember how I was

687
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:00,639
talking about the initial sequence

688
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:02,679
numbers from from the point of view of

689
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,450
sir from the direction of server to

690
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,419
client well that's a 32-bit field so we

691
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:09,970
take this information and we stick it

692
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,799
into this field and see what happens so

693
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:18,549
we have the first in packet and then

694
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,470
this is the hash this will be the same

695
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,149
cookie the server is going to calculate

696
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,460
this based on the source IP destination

697
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,700
port and so on and then it's going to

698
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,549
use this number as its initial sequence

699
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,850
number

700
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,670
well we know what's going to happen this

701
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,260
gnome number is going to come back in

702
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,270
the third packet increased by one well

703
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,460
everybody can subtract one from that

704
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,830
number so if the server takes all the

705
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,780
properties that we looked at a second

706
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,000
ago like IP source IP destination IP

707
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,400
source port destination port it can

708
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,770
calculate the exact same hash as it did

709
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,260
for packet number one and compare it

710
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,120
with this number in if they match that

711
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,680
means that packet number one was

712
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,620
actually sent at this point the server

713
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,790
can just outright drop or not having not

714
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,560
have to remember anything about packet

715
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,960
number one any questions on this

716
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,449
you

717
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,029
so basically just to summarize this by

718
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:25,799
using a hash to preserve or a test that

719
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,330
some information that is gathered from

720
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,389
packet number one and stored here we use

721
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:32,249
a hash to a test that we have this

722
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:33,899
information or that this the first

723
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,119
packet really happened by including this

724
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,429
hash in the third packet and if the

725
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:40,080
server can calculate successfully and

726
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,509
match those edges it has assurance that

727
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:43,769
the first packet of the connection

728
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:46,379
happened does it doesn't even need to

729
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:50,340
remember anything regarding incoming

730
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,049
connections so this is how the cookies

731
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:56,730
work and just quickly the only downside

732
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,820
of sin cookies is that the TCP options

733
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,739
that are stored or being that can be

734
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,899
conveyed through this caching mechanism

735
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,989
are very limited and this is why they

736
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:11,460
are off until the machine needs to start

737
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,409
using cookies so when this queue here

738
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,809
starts to fill up then the machine is

739
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,609
going to enable sin cookie processing

740
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:20,239
before that is going to operate normally

741
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:24,690
and this is just to increase performance

742
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:30,809
or when there is no attack okay so no

743
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,340
questions that means either the video

744
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,809
stream is completely broken and nothing

745
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:37,049
is going through or everybody's fallen

746
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:42,119
asleep okay so looking at amplification

747
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,059
and reflection we have a couple of terms

748
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,759
that very often get coming good and I

749
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,009
just want to go over quickly at the two

750
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:52,559
of them so reflection is when you use

751
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,259
certain properties of the protocol very

752
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:57,119
specifically those are mostly abused

753
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,210
around UDP to direct traffic to the

754
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,009
victim by replacing the source IP

755
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:05,669
address of a packet like this so I'm the

756
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,389
attacker and I have the reflector and

757
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:11,219
here I'm going to replace the source IP

758
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,739
with the IP of the target and whenever

759
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,899
this traffic goes back whatever this

760
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,839
traffic is it is going to basically hit

761
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,940
the target so this is reflection now

762
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:29,960
amplification is complementary

763
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,790
which basically is if I send a small

764
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:39,349
query and I receive a large answer this

765
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,480
is what the amplification component is

766
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,418
now here a quick note domains that have

767
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:48,530
DNS SEC enabled are particularly how to

768
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:52,250
say they can taking create a very large

769
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,030
answer

770
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,129
they're very prolific in what the in the

771
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:58,430
answers that they provide but don't hold

772
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,089
this against against DNS SEC just

773
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:05,809
because if I'm the attacker to execute

774
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:07,700
some of those attacks I do not need to

775
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,109
actually find one of those domains and

776
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,210
I'll cover this in just a second I got

777
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,160
sidetracked here but basically the idea

778
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,589
is that we have a packet that is going

779
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:21,950
to give me much bigger response so let's

780
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,819
look at DNS long long time ago we had a

781
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:29,349
limit of 512

782
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:33,489
oh thank thank you you have fun when you

783
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:39,940
used to have 512 bytes response so why

784
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,190
was that many years ago just this was

785
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,949
how DNS was designed this is also the

786
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:47,140
reason we only have 13 root servers

787
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,509
because in the original specification

788
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:51,789
once you are going to send this query to

789
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:53,170
ask for the root servers you're going to

790
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,630
get everything looked in this packet but

791
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,819
then they could only fit 13 IP addresses

792
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:00,309
in this response so just a piece of

793
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:02,529
trivia there so having said that though

794
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:05,019
there's an extension called a DNS zero

795
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:07,569
which allows for much larger answers so

796
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:10,420
this is how DNS can actually be used to

797
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,069
determine much larger answers then

798
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,489
originally many years ago and here I'm

799
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:17,579
quickly covering some of the amplifier

800
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,930
amplifier types and then I'm going to

801
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,390
tie both of them together so this is the

802
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,319
publication of us-cert and you can see

803
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:29,469
the different amplification factors now

804
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:31,809
some of those are not I would say very

805
00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:33,999
accurate but it gives a very very good

806
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:37,690
overview of the damage that can be

807
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,749
caused like you see memcache D like when

808
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:43,119
you start streaming data of a bucket it

809
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,759
can get really really bad okay so let's

810
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,920
try both of those together in an fact

811
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,589
called DNS reflection so we're going to

812
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:58,170
do a dig and

813
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,540
to happen is we're going to get this

814
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,849
really big answer we're sending the

815
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:04,210
packet

816
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,930
but we replaced the source IP address

817
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,950
with the one of our target

818
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:17,630
and then our target gets a really big

819
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,050
packet now this could be a you know 4k

820
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,620
8k and more now here is the note I

821
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,500
wanted to make a little bit earlier

822
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,600
what's interesting here is that the

823
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,000
Purdue name servers do not need to know

824
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,640
anything about this attack happening it

825
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,340
is just the fact that this attacker is

826
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,800
going to use a recursive DNS server

827
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,800
which has cached the answer for this

828
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,910
query and they're going to return this

829
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,810
answer with the same success

830
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,180
the attacker can create their own domain

831
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,130
code whatever they want and they can

832
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,190
stick or whatever records they want to

833
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,800
put in that domain just to make the

834
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,430
answer bigger so note that in DDoS

835
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:08,140
industry in in reflected DNS attacks

836
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,610
whatever the domain is use they have

837
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,120
absolutely no clue what's happening and

838
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,500
they usually just used because of the

839
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,780
size of the answer now in some cases

840
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,610
when you're investigating this it may

841
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,310
give you a hint who the attacker is and

842
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,000
why they're using this but that's kind

843
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,490
of a rare thing so one of the examples

844
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,510
is iousy was attacked probably seven

845
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,120
years ago and it was attacked by

846
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,640
particular Russian criminals that were

847
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,820
taken down or a botnet that they had was

848
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,790
taken down before a little before that

849
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,360
so they used is C as the domain just to

850
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,820
kind of signal their discontent but

851
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,950
there's really not much to the actual

852
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,540
name it's all about the size of the

853
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,420
response now having said that we have

854
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,090
one query and one large response which

855
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,790
is not that bad however what the

856
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,380
attackers would do they're going to take

857
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,720
a very large number of reflectors and

858
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,190
they're going to start folding them with

859
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,380
queries and then all of those are going

860
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,880
to start folding the target with

861
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,970
responses and that's how the attack

862
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,510
works

863
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:20,750
any questions so far on DNS deflection

864
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,060
I'm seeing somebody stopping this from

865
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:34,680
holding it for a second what is that

866
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,109
give up okay I will see if you have

867
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:38,609
questions I can go back to the slides

868
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,270
and also type those basically go back

869
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,190
and answer the question even if I'm in

870
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,000
the next section

871
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,510
okay so ntp reflection a very similar

872
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:53,700
situation because it runs over UDP here

873
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,220
the difference in logistics is that we

874
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,310
have basically the notion of those

875
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,590
stratum servers different stratum so the

876
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,300
lower the number is the closer there's

877
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:08,119
more precise time more accurate time and

878
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:14,130
and then we have a workstation here now

879
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,440
what's going to happen is that

880
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,849
historically if you have an entire

881
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,560
organization and many people calling

882
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,330
this NTP server if you want to take it

883
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,520
down for maintenance for example it's

884
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,770
going to be very helpful for you to know

885
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,960
what IP addresses have been quitting

886
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,710
this server just so that you know who is

887
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,260
going to be without time for the

888
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,270
duration of the maintenance now to make

889
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,940
this even easier for the administrator

890
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,470
instead of them having to log into the

891
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,080
machine and look through the log files

892
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,150
they decided to create this command

893
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,760
which is an extension it's a monastic

894
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,800
squad or query it's called but it's

895
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,339
something else in ntp that basically

896
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,920
will query this list of IP addresses and

897
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,500
it's going to be returned to the admin

898
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,380
so you can see here how if I wish to be

899
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,859
the bad guy I can just use this

900
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:08,670
information and make a request to get a

901
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,619
list of those IP addresses and just

902
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:12,990
substitute my IP address for the IP

903
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,250
address of the victim and then the

904
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,200
answer is going to go to the victim now

905
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,780
here we only have three clients mostly

906
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,670
because I was too lazy to have more

907
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,800
populated but also because in reality

908
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,230
there will not be a very large number of

909
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,460
machines that are going to be paying

910
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,040
this NTP server now maybe fifty eight

911
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,470
you know kind of the upper end however

912
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,860
this buffer here is six hundred and

913
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,500
so the attacker can actually go and send

914
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,630
some fake queries pre-populate these go

915
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:45,380
up to 600 entries and then from there

916
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,510
they can do the same with many machines

917
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,070
and then set the query to buy machines

918
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,320
which are going to dinner service the

919
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,860
victim so again going back here the

920
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,630
attacker is going to substitute their

921
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,370
source IP address for the one of the

922
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,960
victim the traffic is going to go to the

923
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,790
victim but also the attacker is going to

924
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,460
crime those caches by sending a lot of

925
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,680
fake queries to them or queries from

926
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,330
non-existent IP addresses just to

927
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,430
populate those so that they have higher

928
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:15,330
reflection ratio and then they're going

929
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,440
to send many queries to different

930
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,360
machines and which is going to dinner

931
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,240
service deep attack so this attack is

932
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,090
fairly popular but not as popular as DNS

933
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,710
deflection I would say DNS deflection is

934
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,180
probably one of the most popular

935
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,410
nowadays there is also actually a

936
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,050
variation of the sim for the tag where

937
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:40,080
they're actually using the using TCP and

938
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,560
the sim packet as a reflection and

939
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,210
you're going to say well but there is no

940
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,340
amplification yes technically there is

941
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,470
no provocation in the syn ACK packet

942
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:53,370
however the host that receives the

943
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,200
packet will have to be tried three to

944
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,580
five times depending on the stack of the

945
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,160
operating system so there is still a

946
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,230
little bit of amplification there if you

947
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,480
start sending seen packets to water

948
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,700
machines on the internet with the victim

949
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,860
being with the victim IP being the

950
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,990
source IP then the estuvo is going to be

951
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,160
a lot of traffic coming back to that

952
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,220
victim multiplied five times but then

953
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,290
it's also going to conceal your IP

954
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,090
address so it's not going to be visible

955
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:25,170
where the attack is coming from okay so

956
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,020
mitigation strategies is I mentioned

957
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,420
earlier it's very important to know how

958
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,760
much a minute or an hour costs to the

959
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,110
business because from there you can

960
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,970
figure out what you want to do because

961
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,280
in many cases mitigating yourself

962
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,100
on-site is extremely expensive this is a

963
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,250
games number of numbers game so this

964
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,380
will have providers like you know Akamai

965
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,530
call executors purchased back my you

966
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:52,440
know fastly quad Flair and it also has

967
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,760
done a bunch of other companies that

968
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,610
basically monetize by aggregating all

969
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:00,020
this together

970
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,680
so looking at the risk pyramid if you

971
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,540
have low level of defenses is the cursor

972
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,829
going through I think it should be going

973
00:44:14,829 --> 00:44:17,710
through but I'm just checking you have

974
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,230
low level of Defense's and then the

975
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,650
lower the level of Defense's you have is

976
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,480
you have more people that can actually

977
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,819
reach this intensity of attack this

978
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:29,260
level of attack so there are more

979
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,020
attackers that can take you down now if

980
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,020
you put resources the bar is going to go

981
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,030
up which is going to effectively limit

982
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,130
the number of people that can execute

983
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:42,010
such an attack now if you go very high

984
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,589
then there will be very limited number

985
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:46,329
of people they were editing on but we

986
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:47,950
know that you know there's never hundred

987
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,440
percent in real life that can execute

988
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,730
that attack but then you will be

989
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,250
overspending on defenses so this is kind

990
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,700
of this decided this thing okay so

991
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,829
mitigation the approaches as I mentioned

992
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:01,270
you can either do it yourself or you can

993
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,359
outsource it thank you

994
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:09,849
and the outsourcing can basically be on

995
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:15,190
demand or always on so what are the

996
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,750
differences and then you have the hybrid

997
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,880
which is basically combination of both

998
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,780
of them so if you have on premise

999
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,710
mitigation here we have the cloud which

1000
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:30,460
is to be known as the Internet and you

1001
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,260
have regular users and they send traffic

1002
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,980
to this server then when the bad guys

1003
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,280
show up and start sending traffic the

1004
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,839
traffic is detected and the mitigation

1005
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,500
equipment goes in and starts filtering

1006
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,829
traffic does the server theoretically is

1007
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:53,140
going to get clean traffic so this is

1008
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,210
what you do on site now one of the

1009
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,550
considerations here is that before you

1010
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,310
can even mitigate on site you have to be

1011
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:04,480
able to deliver this traffic now traffic

1012
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,160
is fairly hard to scare or a delivery

1013
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,530
more traffic is easy to scale however

1014
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:12,960
adding

1015
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,290
thinking of its circuits to your

1016
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:19,230
company's qualification is not as easy

1017
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,290
and it's also very expensive so the

1018
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,210
problem here is that you're limited by

1019
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,190
the incoming bandwidth yes you have a

1020
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:28,140
mitigation device SuperDuper mitigation

1021
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,090
device but if somebody sends you more

1022
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,910
bandwidth than your uplink to your

1023
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,860
mitigation device then you're toast so

1024
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,750
looking at the might be here for thing

1025
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,190
gigabits and this is prices from a

1026
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,310
couple years ago it was very but for

1027
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,220
North America maybe about to Cape term

1028
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,620
and for thinking circuit colocation

1029
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,000
space here we're talking about small

1030
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,920
deponent maybe half a rack something

1031
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,780
like this power and the solvent depends

1032
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,220
this is kind of an average price per

1033
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,320
port at the time when I was doing this

1034
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,260
when I when I looked at the prices so

1035
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,390
this becomes very expensive now when you

1036
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,870
add people becomes even more expensive

1037
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,880
and you certainly have limitations there

1038
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,440
so if you don't have very large care of

1039
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,460
traffic you're dealing with it's

1040
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,470
probably better off to have this thing

1041
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,200
sent outside of the company and have

1042
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,960
somebody else that is dedicating entire

1043
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,330
teams and equipment deal with that okay

1044
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:28,080
so with the external services in some

1045
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,030
cases the pricing may be based on an

1046
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,710
attack those would be usually the

1047
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,450
traffic cleaners that would take your

1048
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,060
traffic when the attack happens then the

1049
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,170
libertines traffic to you when the

1050
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,570
attack is over they're going to stop

1051
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,250
introducing the BGP announcements and

1052
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,900
traffic goes back to you or you can

1053
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,740
basically be paying just based on the

1054
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,230
clean traffic now the operating model

1055
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,820
and this is going to be the case for CD

1056
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,380
ends and we'll look at in a second how

1057
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,090
this thing works the operating model can

1058
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,060
be on demand so attack happens they take

1059
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,150
over or can always be on so let's look

1060
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:07,800
at on demand protection again we have

1061
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,600
the internet here we have the legitimate

1062
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,210
users and then we have the attackers

1063
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,920
once the attacker start sending attack

1064
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,000
traffic it gets detected the detection

1065
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,220
system is then going to signal the

1066
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,480
service provider

1067
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,980
and then the service provider is going

1068
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,800
to start injecting bridge pier outs

1069
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,260
which is going to draw all the traffic

1070
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,920
there including the attack traffic okay

1071
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,510
so all the chuffing is going to those

1072
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:40,540
mitigation pods but now we have to

1073
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,250
deliver it in some way to the server

1074
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,040
well let's stuff right what are we going

1075
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,210
to do we can either do a dedicated

1076
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:49,480
server or as most people do 99% of the

1077
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,300
people do it's going to be a Giri tunnel

1078
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,340
well the tram with Giri tunnels is that

1079
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,200
it is going to introduce an additional

1080
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,160
header so if I already have packets that

1081
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,300
are let's say an MTU 1500 and there are

1082
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,480
four packets and I introduced this

1083
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,250
header then I'm certainly going to start

1084
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,170
fragmenting those additionally which

1085
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,780
will have to be reassembled here which

1086
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,920
means also there'll be some more

1087
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,630
bandwidth here but again this is a

1088
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:19,540
consideration it's not a break a deal

1089
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:24,010
breaker yes yes and somebody mentioned

1090
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,480
here in the chat that it's better to

1091
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,890
have an external service because more

1092
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:29,230
education yes here is you can see I have

1093
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:32,260
only drawn two pods which basically are

1094
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,810
closer to the users but in reality what

1095
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,090
happens is that they have 30 to 40 and

1096
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,310
so on so they will be very close to the

1097
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,490
users which in turn is also going to

1098
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,320
increase

1099
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,369
improve some other properties of the

1100
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:46,690
connection and I'll cover this in the

1101
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:50,470
CDN side so anyway you have those dirty

1102
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,109
tunnels which are problematic long term

1103
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:55,330
because also somebody here may see give

1104
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,430
eternal with no traffic when there's no

1105
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,260
attacks and then they may decide to

1106
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,790
clean up the configuration of the router

1107
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,810
and what happens next well we have an

1108
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,310
attack and the gyrator know is not

1109
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,810
configured on this side because somebody

1110
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:09,520
was wise enough to clean up the

1111
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,100
configuration because the jury endpoint

1112
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,040
was not used so there are other things

1113
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,200
that can go wrong here now there is also

1114
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,510
another consideration the timing of the

1115
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:23,619
attack so we have detection first here

1116
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:26,830
then after the detection usually you

1117
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,359
have to be a human being that will be

1118
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,790
page that you have to decide if they

1119
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:32,260
want to authorize this I think a lot of

1120
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,330
businesses are risk averse and they

1121
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,119
don't do the automatically direction but

1122
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,920
just staging and then

1123
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,410
sending the signaling even if we if we

1124
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:44,019
said that the human makes one second

1125
00:50:44,019 --> 00:50:46,089
decision we're still looking at a lot of

1126
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:48,579
time then the BGP route propagation is

1127
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,559
also going to take some time so here

1128
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,630
we're looking at at least five maybe ten

1129
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,490
minutes for this defense to actually

1130
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,859
start working and effectively cleaning

1131
00:50:56,859 --> 00:50:58,809
traffic up so this is if the attack

1132
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:00,970
ramps up very quickly this is going to

1133
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,529
be out each time which you have to be

1134
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:06,010
willing to accept now with always on

1135
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:09,849
mitigation it can basically be just the

1136
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:11,710
second stage of this we have the

1137
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:14,250
mitigation provider with the back end

1138
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,710
sent here and whenever the attack

1139
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:22,089
happens they just filter the traffic and

1140
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:24,910
so on now one thing I forgot to mention

1141
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:29,079
is that in the on-demand type of attack

1142
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:32,529
or mitigation approaches um if the

1143
00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:34,750
attacker decides to run several trace

1144
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,930
routes they will be able to locate where

1145
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:42,130
the origin servers are which means that

1146
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,420
when this IP space is moved they will no

1147
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,279
longer be able to directly attack the IP

1148
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:50,769
space of the server however they will

1149
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:53,109
still be able to send volume attacks

1150
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,299
volumetric attacks against the

1151
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:57,369
supporting infrastructure which is going

1152
00:51:57,369 --> 00:51:59,650
to be two to three trace route hops

1153
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,319
before the space that was moved away

1154
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,690
thus if an attacker really knows what

1155
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,039
they're doing they can directly attack

1156
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,299
the infrastructure and the pipes without

1157
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:12,130
attacking the space that was already

1158
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,180
moved somewhere else

1159
00:52:15,509 --> 00:52:18,880
okay so always on basically the same

1160
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,369
picture but the everything is already

1161
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:24,160
set up from the beginning and this also

1162
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,250
allows you to conceal the location of

1163
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,970
the origin server

1164
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,740
now hybrid abs one seconds not happen

1165
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,770
here approaches I click through the

1166
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,720
slides too quickly so this was the

1167
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,640
always-on now now the next one we're

1168
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,550
going to cover is actually CDN so CDN is

1169
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,250
a form of always-on

1170
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,070
however the Citians primary purpose is

1171
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,530
actually accelerating access to content

1172
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:56,790
so what happens is you have all those

1173
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,520
nodes that are forward deployed that

1174
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,980
will cache some of the content

1175
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,869
this is particularly you know this is

1176
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:05,550
going to be basically the static content

1177
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,310
like images and so on and in some cases

1178
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,980
can catch some of the dynamic content

1179
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,830
and in some cities you can also run

1180
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:16,950
active processes on those nodes that can

1181
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,560
actually generate content those usually

1182
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,980
come in as webassembly

1183
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:25,980
type of proteins that you can run on the

1184
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,369
actual node so the idea of the CDN is

1185
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:32,910
that they move this front that the

1186
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,300
customers are facing or accessing very

1187
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,089
close to the customer so for example

1188
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:41,130
like like think about what's Angeles and

1189
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,260
if my origin servers are in the Bay Area

1190
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,089
well here we're looking at you know five

1191
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:46,830
milliseconds latency what if my servers

1192
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,869
are on the East Coast well here we're

1193
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:51,150
looking at 60 milliseconds latency so

1194
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,920
for a three-way handshake to happen I'm

1195
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,970
looking at hundred and eighty

1196
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,970
milliseconds and then for this window in

1197
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,099
with that allows me to send larger

1198
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:00,810
packets of the alert amounts of data

1199
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:03,030
before I get an acknowledgment it would

1200
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,950
take multiple round trips for this

1201
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,589
window to grow up now if I was to have a

1202
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:10,320
pop in Los Angeles then the round-trip

1203
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,670
time there would be one to two

1204
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,650
milliseconds for every coin the Tiwi

1205
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,930
handshake is going to close so five

1206
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:19,200
milliseconds and then from there all the

1207
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,880
content is going to be downloaded very

1208
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,950
quickly here over this connection which

1209
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,770
is also going to allow for rapid growth

1210
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,450
of the window but even if the window is

1211
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,890
not growing I have one to two

1212
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,859
milliseconds delay this is not really an

1213
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:34,740
issue so the content will be delivered

1214
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,349
much faster to this end node now if

1215
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:39,750
there is any content that is not here

1216
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,339
and needs to be received from the origin

1217
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:43,099
server there's already a back

1218
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:45,440
connection that's open it already has a

1219
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,479
large window built up because this

1220
00:54:47,479 --> 00:54:49,720
connection has been open for a while and

1221
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,789
the packet the object basically will be

1222
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,009
transferred in one hit there will be one

1223
00:54:55,009 --> 00:54:57,289
request coming in here then the all the

1224
00:54:57,289 --> 00:54:59,119
content is going to be going back onto

1225
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,220
the connection before this thing even

1226
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,650
needs to send another AG packet to a

1227
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,509
Polish the traffic is in it's going to

1228
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:08,630
come very quickly so this is how CD ends

1229
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:12,039
work now as a side effect they also can

1230
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:14,329
manage the now service attacks because

1231
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:16,819
they are the front end of your servers

1232
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:18,410
so if somebody is attacking them

1233
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,390
attacking you they're actually attacking

1234
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,779
the CDN and in many cases that is the

1235
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,220
Citians problem and they're

1236
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,720
professionals in doing this type of work

1237
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,880
so they can defend you fairly well which

1238
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,339
is cool in some cases they may charge

1239
00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:32,960
you x2 in some cases they may not charge

1240
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,489
X it depends on how often you are

1241
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:38,239
attacked and so on so that I would say

1242
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,190
it's probably one of the most successful

1243
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,079
way of dealing with attacks and

1244
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,029
mitigating and having a strategy overall

1245
00:55:44,029 --> 00:55:46,670
for most companies later like medium and

1246
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:51,950
small size yep so that's it on the

1247
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,880
mitigation hybrid basically works is you

1248
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,329
have a mitigation device on premise when

1249
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:01,099
the device detects that the attack goes

1250
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,950
above certain threshold then it is going

1251
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,479
to signal the cloud to start introducing

1252
00:56:07,479 --> 00:56:09,859
BGP routes and move the traffic

1253
00:56:09,859 --> 00:56:14,779
somewhere else and this I think mostly

1254
00:56:14,779 --> 00:56:16,489
came because of particular vendors that

1255
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:18,200
were hardware vendors then they were

1256
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,529
figured out that the cloud is going to

1257
00:56:20,529 --> 00:56:23,690
pretty much take over their business and

1258
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,599
they had to move in that space but they

1259
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,400
still wanted to continue selling

1260
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,440
hardware and this is how we ended up

1261
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,650
there

1262
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:38,020
I'm just checking what's in the discord

1263
00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:40,839
you

1264
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,920
you

1265
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,190
okay that's probably not a question for

1266
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:54,119
me again okay this is kind of a quick

1267
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:58,109
comparison of the different options we

1268
00:56:58,109 --> 00:57:02,220
have questions

1269
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,890
you

1270
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:07,069
okay well thank you everyone if you have

1271
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:10,700
any questions you have my email and

1272
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,559
actually what I'm going to do I'm going

1273
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,299
to quickly go to that slide if somebody

1274
00:57:14,299 --> 00:57:18,079
didn't copy it so I just put in the

1275
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,559
subject jungle so that I know where it's

1276
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:25,249
coming from and that's it thank you very

1277
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:27,459
much
