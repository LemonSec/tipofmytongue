1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
and it's but and then it's either I

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,259
trade off sleep for security research or

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,270
find little nuggets of time during the

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,160
day but but I love security it's both

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,230
it's both a career as well as a hobby

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,290
and I would I would say - one of the

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,360
things about this time especially is

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,920
that I've been in security now for about

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,410
12 years doing actual direct security

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,170
roles and in various areas but I would

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,910
say if you are whether you're starting

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,590
out in security or you're just looking

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,199
for that next step this time right now

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,750
has been unprecedented in like all at

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,030
least all the past decade that I've been

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,100
in security in terms of just the amount

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,690
of things you can get engaged in the

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,730
amount of free free resources the

19
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,290
virtual conferences like this that are

20
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,629
going on just constantly it's no longer

21
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,730
an issue of budgetarily I can't afford

22
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,350
this or I can't travel here it's

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,270
literally a consumption issue and that's

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,010
a challenging and that's one of the

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,329
things that I would say if you're

26
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,770
thinking the next step look for those

27
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,660
free resources get engaged whether it's

28
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,579
capture the flags whether it's bug

29
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,140
bounties whether it's watching free

30
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,760
resources or if you can't watch a

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,930
conference during the day like this

32
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,940
watch the recordings of them find out

33
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,970
follow social media I know one of the

34
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,100
one of the things I missed that I kind

35
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,720
of missed as the industry got started

36
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,390
was kind of that growing up in IRCs and

37
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,220
chat rooms I just missed a lot of that

38
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,320
phase I feel like we've returned to that

39
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,909
and it's awesome and I'm eating it up

40
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,189
and I would advise you as well staying

41
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,229
engaged during this join the slack tinos

42
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,960
join the discord teams to be able to

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,850
communicate directly with all these

44
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,650
people that you watch through twitter or

45
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,659
through the industry and just seeing the

46
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,159
same chat rooms talking back and forth

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,740
bouncing ideas it's it's a time that I

48
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,780
have not seen in my entire career and

49
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,210
it's awesome and as discouraged as it

50
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,470
can be where we're not going to be in

51
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,880
person that a lot of these conferences

52
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,710
we're not going to get to talk it's also

53
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,840
a limiter for a lot of people and now it

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,390
gives a lot of equal opportunity for all

55
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,220
of us to kind of join together and let's

56
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,720
let's make security better and that's

57
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,820
that's kind of what drove this talk is

58
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,070
how can we do a better job finding those

59
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,079
gaps those holes the things that we've

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,450
systemic ly struggled with as a program

61
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,180
as a as an industry how can we make it

62
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,040
better how can we take these this

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,020
collaborative atmosphere learn from each

64
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,758
other not recreate the wheel and how can

65
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,288
we move faster so that's what I want to

66
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,000
share with you today and hopefully no

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
matter what level your

68
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,090
about whether you're a what are whether

69
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,489
you live sleep and breathe in code

70
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,340
whether you're a manager whether you're

71
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,269
an aspiring career information security

72
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,069
whatever you want to do that's kind of

73
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,349
the the key advice and also this is kind

74
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,930
of a message to managers as well leaders

75
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,450
in your programs in your companies one

76
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,799
thing that I kind of find that I

77
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,349
struggle with is ambition curiosity and

78
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:38,879
we have so many people especially the

79
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,860
ones that of anybody that's on this

80
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,360
today that's giving up your Saturday to

81
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,700
be engaged you're the ones that are the

82
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,530
future of this industry the ones that

83
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,180
are going to continue to lead us forward

84
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,370
and it's tough a lot of times to find

85
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,049
that time I know it's it's an investment

86
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:53,910
in that personal time but at the same

87
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,590
time where can we find those trade offs

88
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,840
where you can invest time like this

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,400
during your wait work day to make

90
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,260
yourself better and that's at least for

91
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,489
me something that I've always struggled

92
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,530
with and I think it's important it now's

93
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,060
the time where can we start finding

94
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,950
balances so that way I know for me I

95
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,599
have a five year old and a three year

96
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,519
old at home and in my security research

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,459
time it's not Spanx during the evenings

98
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,200
when I get home from work it's the time

99
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,480
spent at 11 p.m. and later whenever I'm

100
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,160
sacrificing sleep because I just have

101
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,870
that desire to be the best who want to

102
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,180
learn and I'm sure a lot of you are in

103
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,310
that same state where it's like you just

104
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,500
can't do more and it's becomes that

105
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,359
balance of burning out versus the

106
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,220
opportunity but I'll tell you right now

107
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,989
this is probably the best time in my

108
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,340
entire career that I've seen where you

109
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,049
can be engaged and be a part of things

110
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,269
and and it's just it's just so fun and

111
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,730
exciting so I hope that I can reflect

112
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,109
some of that I'm gonna give you nuggets

113
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:44,760
of career growth how you can and I'm

114
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,130
gonna actually dig down to and show some

115
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,019
pretty technical details and try to hit

116
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,200
all aspects this is the quote that I

117
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,209
pulled a couple years ago it's actually

118
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,669
from 2017 and I pretty much lived by

119
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,590
this in terms of things will never move

120
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,980
this slowly again and I I can't see a

121
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,079
show of hands but that's so true and

122
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,970
it's only gotten true a year after year

123
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,530
and it just feels like everything is

124
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,090
moving so fast around us as security

125
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,310
professionals how will we ever keep up

126
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,859
just today alone I found we've seen ways

127
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,599
to bypass firewalls we've seen honey

128
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,079
pots we've seen you in numerous

129
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,160
enumeration just there's so many things

130
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,048
going on how do we how do we keep up as

131
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:24,900
a as an industry the other part of this

132
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,490
is and I loved how

133
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,810
we've started off today talking about

134
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,520
containers and I feel like that's where

135
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,380
we're going is if you look in this left

136
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,819
side of the slide with the bolts on

137
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,039
security this is kind of the historic

138
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,080
castle moat mentality where we invest

139
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,000
millions of dollars into this core

140
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,400
infrastructure of security that you will

141
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,470
never go outside of we have defense in

142
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,810
depth we have layers that's not where

143
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,190
the world that's going now we will

144
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,780
always have kind of this legacy

145
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,330
atmosphere but what's happening is we're

146
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,039
talking security by design we're talking

147
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,449
embedded security we're talking that

148
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,819
shift left where security now it's not

149
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,729
only just secure of secure code this is

150
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,650
an ecosystem that you are deploying

151
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,380
where you need to embed all security

152
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,599
layers all depths into your application

153
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,340
into your infrastructure into your

154
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,889
interior code essentially and I think

155
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,599
call me in the comment even or somebody

156
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,430
did today about talking about DevOps and

157
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,050
how you really need to be a network

158
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,770
engineer and a app developer and a

159
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,000
assistant infrastructure engineer server

160
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,370
admin you almost have to have all that

161
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,990
tied up into your application and that

162
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,240
is really difficult and if there was an

163
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,460
area that I would say that to be better

164
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,530
at security just in general is you're

165
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,960
now starting to be better you need to

166
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,820
know all these areas and unfortunately

167
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,830
it's not just being deep in one and why

168
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,530
to everything it's now a point of we

169
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,330
don't have enough headcount enough staff

170
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,280
enough resources to be deep everywhere

171
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,139
how do we cover it these gaps then learn

172
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,330
and how do we maintain them it's it's

173
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,370
almost exhausting but you have to love

174
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,560
it and you have to enjoy it and know

175
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,789
that there's going to be failures

176
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,469
there's gonna be breaches there's gonna

177
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,360
be issues along the way and what we need

178
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
to strive for us where can we do better

179
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,469
where can we solve the mundane tasks

180
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:03,300
that take up our time so we can focus on

181
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,310
the innovation so we can stay ahead of

182
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,259
those red teamers the adversaries and

183
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,360
build resilient systems that have these

184
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,190
layers of security without burning

185
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,020
ourselves out and being effective while

186
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,090
also changing that model without always

187
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,800
changing the people but upscaling

188
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,050
changing and where to learn where do I

189
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,090
spend the time and it's difficult and

190
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,610
it's it's exciting at the same time and

191
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,590
it's just it's really fascinating to

192
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,690
watch and I would say any companies are

193
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,860
moving that direction whether you're

194
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,780
castle moat today you're not going to be

195
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,820
in the future to be successful as a

196
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,219
company as a business and not only that

197
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:36,779
but now we're starting to talk cloud

198
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,580
infrastructure cloud computing

199
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,720
technology

200
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,660
no longer backhauling data all through

201
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,640
this millions of dollars security stack

202
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,680
and your data centers you now have a

203
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,960
data center with that stack you have a

204
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,790
cloud with the stock and you have about

205
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,280
200 other staffs infrastructure at

206
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
service clouds that are not routing back

207
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,090
to your data center those are going

208
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,950
either directly from a user to a cloud

209
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,140
it's going for cloud to cloud and it is

210
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,990
just becoming so decentralized ecosystem

211
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,730
where how do we address that how is

212
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,220
security professionals can we win can we

213
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,230
over take this and I know I didn't sign

214
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,060
up the loose and I know a lot of times

215
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,190
will say well breaches invisible here

216
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,710
it's just a matter of if not matter when

217
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,230
that if however but I I don't want to

218
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,330
lose and and I want to be as successful

219
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,370
as possible and I want to make everybody

220
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,170
around me as successful as possible for

221
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,520
that so we're gonna talk about ways we

222
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,130
can do that does anybody feel like

223
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,740
Dennis here in an information security

224
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,480
where you have you feel like the world

225
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,100
is just moving around you everything is

226
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,690
getting automated moving forward but in

227
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,640
security it's always you need to talk to

228
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,650
so-and-so or you can't go forward

229
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,450
because there's too much risk or doing

230
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,910
that that's how we have to get better at

231
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,370
this week not every decision in security

232
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,410
has to be made by a person it's how can

233
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,270
we leverage data how can we make these

234
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,370
data-driven decisions and move forward

235
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,620
without having to be that roadblock

236
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,120
because a lot of these processes as

237
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,160
we've talked about CICE today the

238
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,300
continuous integration continuous

239
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,120
deployment there's no room in CI CD for

240
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,660
manual steps manual processes so I

241
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,650
recommend if you're trying to move

242
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,990
faster and move forward looking to your

243
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,760
information security program or the way

244
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,190
that you operate in your job and say are

245
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,990
there steps where somebody has to talk

246
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,180
to me and if that's the case how do you

247
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,100
automate it how do you figure out what

248
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,600
goes through my brain what goes through

249
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,940
my head that I make the decision rather

250
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,040
than is it possible to codify is it

251
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,660
possible that we can have this buffer of

252
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,240
risk appetite this and start thinking in

253
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,039
terms of how can I get rid of those

254
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,200
manual steps so I can move forward and

255
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,150
focus on the new technologies that we

256
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,799
need to look at whether it's containers

257
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,839
and the cloud and big data and all these

258
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,339
things it's not like you're working

259
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,929
yourself out of a job it's it's

260
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,300
codifying what you're good at and then

261
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,640
so you can get better and I think if you

262
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,410
take that mentality it's pretty exciting

263
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,089
and I'm going to show you some ways and

264
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:53,610
tool sets where you can start to do that

265
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,550
I also love this quote by Jeremiah

266
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,649
Grossman mostly because it's scary that

267
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,570
I believe it's true and I've spent a

268
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,519
couple years that insurance company and

269
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,019
you better believe if you ever replaced

270
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,180
a claim I mean everything in its

271
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,610
security company is is measured through

272
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,649
actuarial data through statistics

273
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,470
through data driven they know if you do

274
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,300
these things you're gonna have this

275
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,180
likelihood of this happening doesn't

276
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,680
that sound like security if you do these

277
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,720
things this likelihood is happening but

278
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,399
in most of the time it's our own gut

279
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,810
feel what if come industries like the

280
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,130
insurance industry actually passes up

281
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,110
the entire security industry and says I

282
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,480
can predict the breach better than you

283
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,100
can predict it yourself as a security

284
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,110
professional I think that's scary but I

285
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,579
also think it's true and I think that's

286
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,920
where we're headed as the industry is

287
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,390
evolving around us because there's so

288
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,040
much business around it so much

289
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,410
statistics so much data we need to get

290
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,180
better as professionals to do that as

291
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,740
well and look at the data I've seen a

292
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,320
giraffe's across the entire landscape of

293
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,700
just technology in general and we've

294
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,260
been seeing this forever this isn't this

295
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,269
isn't necessarily new but I think it's

296
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,010
starting to accelerate and it's starting

297
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,870
to hit all business there it's not just

298
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,390
specific ones and the first one is data

299
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,640
gravity a lot of times you'll hear the

300
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,470
question of well we're going to the

301
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,540
cloud we only need to do why can't we do

302
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,250
everything in Amazon why can't we do

303
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,380
everything in Google or Microsoft or IBM

304
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,709
well the challenge is data everybody is

305
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:21,390
moving more from a business standpoint

306
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,070
against data-driven decisions

307
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,130
data-driven analytics logs metadata

308
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,640
tagging collection all of that and that

309
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,000
data gravity is very expensive a lot of

310
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,070
times to move so it's actually more

311
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,720
efficient more effective to move your

312
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,190
compute your infrastructure your

313
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,100
platforms your embedded ecosystem of

314
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,350
security closer to that data and that's

315
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,940
the point is if we can get our systems

316
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,110
embedded with security by design

317
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,149
principles and do that then move them

318
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,680
where they need push them to the data

319
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,149
see your business can make faster

320
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,220
decisions and we can be enabling the

321
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,839
business at the same time but it's it's

322
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,880
tough it's challenging we one size does

323
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
not fit all in the world that we're

324
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,449
living in now give you some example

325
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,440
examples of why that's the case the

326
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,050
other area is democratize accessibility

327
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,500
of data

328
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't know if you've ever gone out and

329
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,890
just searched for the what data is out

330
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,420
there that you can leverage and do but

331
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,460
it's pretty cool and exciting and and

332
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,020
these are just some security examples

333
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,640
alone but as you're a red team or a bug

334
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,560
bounty hunter or anything like that did

335
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,130
you know that rapid7 is has a data set

336
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,750
that's publicly available publicly

337
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,240
accessible to everybody on here that has

338
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,390
the forward DNS of the entire internet I

339
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,090
mean just that data alone think about it

340
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,920
from and I know there's tools like AMS

341
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,860
and others that from I know gee I'm

342
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,660
Jason Haddix is gonna talk about the bug

343
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,760
bounty methodology and a lot of that is

344
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
tapping into these data sources so there

345
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,240
are tools that do it are you do it but

346
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,710
just knowing that that's out there for

347
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,770
me github that's that is cash the public

348
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,810
of repos aren't a big data set that you

349
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,610
can query you can search against you can

350
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,340
do that you talk about um semantics or

351
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,650
this some grep that we talked about

352
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,750
earlier there's a there's a data set

353
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,980
called common crawl and I'm going to

354
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,600
show you a few examples with several of

355
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,160
these a little bit later on in this talk

356
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,380
but common crawl has been crawling the

357
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,480
Internet of public websites for years

358
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,460
for about eight years now and they have

359
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,580
the full HTML captures of it so that

360
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,720
includes like all of your JavaScript

361
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,910
references includes full I mean if you

362
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,650
think HTML it has every link every

363
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,360
change and they've been doing that for

364
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,040
eight years now and there's about 25

365
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,990
billion sites and that data set alone

366
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,420
that we have free access to the question

367
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,640
is how how do we get access how do we

368
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,980
love it it takes your Google search for

369
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,760
HTML how awesome is that I think it's

370
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,220
exciting but we need to figure out how

371
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,900
do we get to that data and how do we

372
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,230
start to adopt those principles the

373
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,580
other part is if you look at what's

374
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,380
going on around us in the world code 19

375
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,260
there is data everywhere that is being

376
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,420
freely given freely uploaded so that we

377
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,850
can find a cure of vaccine a solution to

378
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,089
this that you or I could literally if we

379
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,300
had the right molecular structures and

380
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,950
information like the data is out there

381
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,810
for us we just need to know how to tap

382
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,460
into it how do we build those resources

383
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,140
and that's where companies are striving

384
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,000
they're saying help us collaborate with

385
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,580
us we can obviously we can make business

386
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,200
decisions and benefit from these things

387
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,210
but this is for you we want to bring the

388
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,740
world closer together to solve the

389
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,390
world's most challenging questions and

390
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,100
and that's where the late Bob kind of

391
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,260
went off for me is what

392
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,770
if the world is solving these problems

393
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,720
information security in comparison to

394
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,110
Kovan 18 is minut so what if we could

395
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,580
use these same approaches these same

396
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,360
tools to solve the same problems as we

397
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,060
have systemically in the security so I

398
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,180
started digging in and I know within big

399
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,220
data science there's probably a lot that

400
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,570
are watching this that have already been

401
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,520
dug into Jupiter notebooks and different

402
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,920
things but the biggest third change of

403
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,570
the industry is its financially liable

404
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,240
now to do more deep analysis to query

405
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,520
big datasets to do it for pennies on the

406
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,440
dollar not thousands of dollars of

407
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,870
investment into a massive home lab of

408
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,060
server action doing just stand up a few

409
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,350
things in the cloud make sure you shut

410
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,580
them down when you're done with them and

411
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,740
you can you can solve some major

412
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,810
problems very quickly and it's

413
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,910
accessible to you in minutes and that's

414
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,450
it's pretty exciting time I saw this

415
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,310
this was probably like yeah June 19th

416
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,590
this was just a few days ago gave the

417
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,970
engineer I need to do a stream where

418
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,170
people bring me their InfoSec

419
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,380
spreadsheets I process them anar but who

420
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,540
I bet everybody on here lives in

421
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,070
spreadsheets especially in securities

422
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,270
security ISM

423
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,890
tourists for spreadsheets it's terrible

424
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,630
and how many times have you done this

425
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,970
same change is the same modification to

426
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,440
a spreadsheet over and over to get

427
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,390
metrics to produce and doing things why

428
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,370
don't we automate that way why do we

429
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,200
still go in today into a spreadsheet and

430
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,850
make changes on a monthly basis that

431
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,830
they get metrics and I think that's the

432
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,690
point of this is there's better ways of

433
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,110
doing things so I didn't even hear about

434
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,000
a Jupiter notebook until about three

435
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,570
years ago when I joined Lilly fir and I

436
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,830
was working with a lot of the research

437
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,720
scientists and I couldn't believe that I

438
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,220
went my entire career without even

439
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,050
hearing about it so my thought is well

440
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,040
what is this it's got to be this

441
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,750
indestructible thing that you just can't

442
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,070
damage it's probably this like little

443
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,720
Chromebook that's in a bowl or something

444
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,700
well that could survive on Jupiter

445
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,790
that's not the case it's just a piece of

446
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,650
software it's browser-based and it's

447
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,420
open source anybody can download it

448
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,590
hopefully you're downloading it now as

449
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,210
we're talking about this supports over

450
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,240
40 programming languages and the

451
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,950
notebooks contain live coats of somebody

452
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,840
like me who is I'm not a programmer by

453
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,700
trade I I can't I know enough to be

454
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,320
dangerous I can get in but if you look

455
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,610
at any of my code which I share don't

456
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,770
github ahead of time you know that it's

457
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,089
pretty simple it's anything

458
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:36,559
you're gonna see them w3schools and

459
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,300
that's about it that's about as far as I

460
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,399
go so it's digestible but the thing that

461
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,199
I get a lot of value out of like

462
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:43,670
something like a Jupiter notebook is I

463
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,009
don't have to set up this Big D compiler

464
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:48,319
this this environment where I'm trying

465
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:49,879
to struggle what's this script doing and

466
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,379
doing that you can break it up pretty

467
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:53,059
easily and run different pieces so it's

468
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,100
really like a debugger but it's friendly

469
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,649
for people that don't program by trade

470
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:59,149
all the time so you think of like

471
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:01,550
citizen developers scientists people

472
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,920
that are maybe math and geniuses and

473
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,720
wizards that that are good at those

474
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,519
things but they're not computer coding

475
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,620
programmers they can they can take this

476
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,269
and do those bits and pieces they know

477
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,620
enough to look at Stack Overflow and

478
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,170
know what they need to achieve and by

479
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,550
searching you can you can solve some

480
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,160
pretty new things what's that there's a

481
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,600
bunch of libraries - these are your a

482
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,339
lot of your own data science type

483
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:23,839
libraries so if you want to do its

484
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,970
statistics or graphs or charts those

485
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,819
matplotlib there's numpy there's bouquet

486
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:30,829
bouquet is actually pretty cool because

487
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:34,309
it can create URLs for it so it can

488
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,509
actually generate like an interactive

489
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:37,519
HTML page that if you have metrics or

490
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,470
things nor zoom in on you could push

491
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,240
that over to like a server list lambda

492
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,999
books to publish it out in s3 and you

493
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,800
could literally have a web page of

494
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,269
interactive graphics and things like

495
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:48,439
that from mesh because throw some cool

496
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:48,980
ideas

497
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,139
BASC is working for bigger data sets

498
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:52,939
where a lot of this runs in memory and a

499
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:54,079
jupiter notebook but if you have

500
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,970
datasets that are too large BASC is a

501
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,649
library I'll just write it to write it

502
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,569
to your hard drive and read it off so

503
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:02,779
lots of lots of things built for solving

504
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,669
some of the biggest data challenges

505
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:07,220
where we can also take advantage of for

506
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,159
information security the other piece is

507
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,839
that security experts love to tell

508
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,319
stories

509
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,109
and I think that's something that we we

510
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,849
all like to talk about what we did this

511
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,339
during this red team or this was a hack

512
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,069
that we heard about or did and as we we

513
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,750
should be better at telling stories that

514
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,609
are data-driven and if you look at these

515
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,869
things these are just data

516
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,940
visualizations made with Jupiter type

517
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,070
notebooks and in the scientific

518
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,539
computing libraries where I think one of

519
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:35,720
these is the the node dependency graph

520
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,570
and chart and one is Python all the the

521
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,370
PI I should have actually double-checked

522
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,020
what those were it's awesome it's like

523
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,640
the dependencies and the edge nodes and

524
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,440
everything for and you can tell some

525
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,350
pretty strong stories and with me I've

526
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,070
been working a lot

527
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,870
with scientists lately and when you work

528
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,910
with scientists everything is how do we

529
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,770
solve this hypothesis how do we ask a

530
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,930
question and we all learned about this

531
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,240
in fifth grade and this is the basic of

532
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,150
let's ask a question let's construct the

533
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,490
hypothesis let's test it does it work

534
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,650
yes or no if it does let's analyze the

535
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,240
data and what strong conclusions out of

536
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,480
it

537
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,520
why are we so bad in information

538
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,950
security at doing this why why do we

539
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,720
just build off of risk-based decisions

540
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,090
or say no over and over without really

541
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,280
quantifying does this make sense

542
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,350
is there enough risk where it's willing

543
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,640
to stop the business what if the

544
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,260
business can make three billion dollars

545
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,080
if we just allow this little low or

546
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,180
medium vulnerability into the system

547
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,980
because we don't have the right depth of

548
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,120
coverage and they're like there's those

549
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,770
things that those are all data driven

550
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,510
type decisions that we need to get

551
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,130
better that we need to think about so in

552
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,620
terms of how can we codify all these

553
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,360
decisions we make on a day to day basis

554
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,740
and I think that's critical to being

555
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,130
further successful in your career so if

556
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,420
that's going right questions and this is

557
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,220
this is advice I like to give to if you

558
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,200
if you're an engineer a programmer or

559
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,670
somebody that wants to continue to move

560
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,440
up whether it's into leadership or doing

561
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,480
you have to think about the questions of

562
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,800
what those stakeholders and those

563
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,360
business stakeholders care about so if

564
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,250
you're an adversary I might ask the

565
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,380
question of well how can I perform more

566
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,970
passive reconnaissance without touching

567
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,610
my target what that means when you're

568
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,010
talking to your seaso is really your

569
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,540
seaso just wants to know what does their

570
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,610
external tax surface look like so you

571
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,930
could be talking about well this is

572
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,220
really cool and this is our newest

573
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,290
latest attack but really all you what

574
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,150
you need to do is raise it up - here's

575
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,040
our external attack surface this is what

576
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,300
you should be most concerned about this

577
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,340
is what we need to cover and then if

578
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,900
you're like a CEO they're just talking

579
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,700
about board of directors or cyber

580
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,400
insurance on leaders what they're

581
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,540
interested in from a business

582
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,400
perspective is one of those our company

583
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,840
look like to our shareholders what

584
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,280
information is out there where we can

585
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,630
compare ourselves in the industry and

586
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,160
there's there's tons of companies out

587
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,630
there that are starting to do that

588
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,520
whether it's a bit cider this recon and

589
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,780
difference where they can actually

590
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,910
create kind of credit scores of what you

591
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,080
look like to the internet whether you

592
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,170
have certificates that are expired or

593
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,050
you have not using the right headers and

594
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,910
things like that and there's there's a

595
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,560
lot of analysis and I bet if you're a

596
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,900
pen tester or a red teamer in here you

597
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,700
already know that as soon as you go to a

598
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,669
site and you start

599
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,200
and a target to mean you start seeing

600
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,239
these things gives a red flags you know

601
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,769
you're going to find something juicier

602
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:09,720
from this target that's the same type of

603
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,549
data points that our CEOs are getting

604
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,019
the boards of directors are getting to

605
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,820
rate CEOs of how they're doing cecil's

606
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,350
or how they're doing is here's your

607
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,059
scorecard against appear in the industry

608
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,070
and then as you're an engineer and

609
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,600
architect or somebody building the

610
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,100
program you have to think in terms of

611
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,480
those are the questions those are the

612
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,309
things that the CEOs and Cecil's are

613
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,710
facing how can we make them successful

614
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,389
because if we can make them successful

615
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:32,999
we can if we can make our leaders

616
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,769
successful it will ultimately make you

617
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:39,210
successful so we're gonna jump into our

618
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,710
first demo I know we've been we've been

619
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,869
talking for a while and I definitely

620
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:45,119
will I'll be in the discord for Dancer

621
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,369
any questions afterwards I if you know

622
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:49,799
me I could talk about security 24/7 all

623
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,889
the time so there's no shortage of

624
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:53,850
conversations here but let's let's jump

625
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,529
right in so this is one example I want

626
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,179
it I want to share it actually did I

627
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,519
wrote the first blog post on this one

628
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,649
doing so it kind of walks there lively

629
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,840
details but I think this is just really

630
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,820
cool and it's something we can set up

631
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,499
and if you've ever done any bug bounty

632
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,619
or recon it's just the simplicity in the

633
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,450
speed of how you can get some user

634
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,100
results and just thinking so as I go

635
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,200
through these demos these are I want you

636
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,399
to think through these as kind of like

637
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,379
templates of like well how is he doing

638
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,239
this and what code and how can I adjust

639
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,249
this to solve this problem that applies

640
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,710
to me or my company or my program and

641
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,080
that's the biggest thing I ask is even

642
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,059
though this will do specific things I'm

643
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,340
trying to build kind of an ecosystem I

644
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,100
called its projects trail a it's in

645
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,899
github and it's something that I've just

646
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:39,809
for me I've not been good at from an

647
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:41,220
industry standpoint of being out there

648
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,600
you probably most of you have actually

649
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,789
never heard of me I would say that I am

650
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:46,559
a bigot one of the biggest lurkers

651
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,600
though and I feel like I know everybody

652
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,879
in the industry because I just spend so

653
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,590
much time reading about what they write

654
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,359
in their work and doing and that's

655
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,159
something that kind of been 20/20 I said

656
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,019
I want to get better at contributing and

657
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,460
giving back and all this knowledge that

658
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,169
I've gained that I've invested into

659
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,940
companies and doing it on my day to day

660
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,279
job how do I share these things that are

661
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,519
not intellectual property for for our

662
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,899
own companies but things that will just

663
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:11,909
make us all better as a as a whole and

664
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:13,320
as an industry so that was kind of one

665
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,450
of my 2020 resolutions is let's get a

666
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,500
blog started let's

667
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,270
better producing things and github so

668
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,640
this is my attempt to to really start

669
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
that and I'm hoping to stick with it so

670
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,000
I hope you get hope everyone on here

671
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,010
holds me accountable to this and I hope

672
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,140
that everyone here can also share if you

673
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,030
see mistakes or things worried hey Ryan

674
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,440
you could enhance this lets me get

675
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,120
better let's work together I mean that's

676
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,130
that's what I want and I think the other

677
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,290
advice that I always have is if you're

678
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,630
worried or nervous one of the scariest

679
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,610
things is sharing in front of your own

680
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,250
peers of experts I could talk all day

681
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,560
long to people within a company that are

682
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,850
outside of security and talk about

683
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,340
security it's scary giving your own

684
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,930
information out whether it's your code

685
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,670
whether it's doing there's so much

686
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,100
impostor syndrome but I know it's

687
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,110
ramping I would just say my advice is

688
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,660
don't let that stop you there's very

689
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,340
little that I've pulled directly from

690
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,410
one person because nothing is perfect

691
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,370
that's out there I could tell you

692
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,230
everything I talked about today there's

693
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,820
at least one person watching this right

694
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,620
now that is better than me way better

695
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,570
than me every one of these areas but

696
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,440
it's just a matter of getting

697
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,850
information out there so that I can

698
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,560
learn from what you're providing that

699
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,570
may help me here or what I'm providing I

700
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,670
don't expect us to help you directly but

701
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,200
by me providing this hopefully you've

702
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,520
been taking apply it to something that

703
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,320
will help you and I think that's just an

704
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,450
awesome approach but it's it's scary you

705
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,220
know I encourage anybody that's kind of

706
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,570
thinking about it or wanting to just

707
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,160
jump in and do it that's and that's

708
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,630
that's I'm gonna try to be transparent

709
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,840
and do the same thing a few so this is

710
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,250
what a jupiter notebook looks like you

711
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,550
can run this locally in anaconda or

712
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,590
really an anaconda is is if you want to

713
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,810
run locally it's free open source or I'm

714
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,250
actually running out of the sage maker

715
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,280
notebook and ews I partially do this

716
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,260
because I mean I'm responsible for

717
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,660
securing a lot of AWS so the best way to

718
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,640
secure things is to understand how they

719
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,650
work how they interact how you can

720
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,870
operate in an ecosystem so and then also

721
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,090
I'm using a lot of calls with within the

722
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,130
AWS ecosystem and just by nature of

723
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,660
running in there you can kind of

724
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,130
eliminate some of the secrets and keys

725
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,750
and do things there item rules so

726
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,370
there's so there's there's a lot of

727
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,630
resources out there there's Google

728
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,610
collaboratory and things but I would say

729
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,470
just jump into a notebook in solution

730
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,820
just check it out and see if it's for

731
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,130
you I I love it and I can't believe I

732
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,750
went about eight to nine years on my

733
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,850
career without ever being in this so

734
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,170
this is how you break it apart to if

735
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,910
you're not a great programmer just break

736
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,290
it into sections and I'm gonna I'm gonna

737
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,730
start off by running this so this just

738
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,490
does my in for

739
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,910
and then we're gonna ignore the this is

740
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,380
just if you're setting this up inside

741
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,090
AWS you know this is that database

742
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,040
server but it's going to actually call

743
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,210
out so we don't have to copy all the

744
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,980
data from that data set it's already

745
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,600
hosted in a public data set may double

746
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,970
yes for the really rapid seven data sets

747
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,140
so we just want to query against it we

748
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,700
don't want to pay for all the data there

749
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,290
we're gonna let them take care of that

750
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,670
for us so this just sets it up it's

751
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,440
three simple queries if you ever run a

752
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,300
database query just run this in a tena

753
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,100
and you'll have it setup in about ten

754
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,220
minutes probably less so we're gonna

755
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,330
jump down to here and this is gonna

756
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,040
start running the code and this can take

757
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,900
this is the cool thing if you're on a

758
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,190
bug bound you're looking for targets

759
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,679
literally you can put in whatever domain

760
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:09,850
you want here so we could choose

761
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,370
anything and if if this is more I wasn't

762
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,390
brave enough to do the interactive

763
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,770
through discourse like they did earlier

764
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,929
so props props to that but we're gonna

765
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:18,670
we're gonna go just let's just do

766
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,500
Microsoft constants already and so what

767
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,700
this is gonna do is this is going to

768
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,460
search the for dns massive data set

769
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,679
provided by rapid7 for any any entries

770
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,690
for microsoft comm so we're just gonna

771
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,940
run it i just press run what this little

772
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,190
output is is this is just my execution

773
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,080
ID by athena it's the it's running the

774
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,300
query right now saying this is how i can

775
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,100
reference it to know so i so I went

776
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,840
ahead I got that pretty instantly I'm

777
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,850
gonna run this next function and it's

778
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,500
gonna take a few seconds this query is

779
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,660
running across I mean giggle I don't

780
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,740
think it's terrible I think this is

781
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,170
actually like gigabytes probably like 25

782
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,780
gigabytes of indexes and so it's going

783
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,890
through running every time he says

784
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,630
running it's five seconds you can in my

785
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,210
blog that I posted actually has a lot of

786
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,500
the details of what it's doing behind

787
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,760
the scenes but really this is just going

788
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,710
in a five second loop saying are you

789
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,020
done are you done are you done and then

790
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,520
what it's gonna do is it's going to get

791
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,190
a the code behind this is going to get

792
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,040
an s3 download of 15 and query results

793
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,470
so the Athena is resolving saying give

794
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,750
me all the microsoft.com entries wild

795
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,270
carded and then put them into a CSV and

796
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,580
then this last step is this is what's

797
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,770
pretty cool if you've never heard of

798
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,140
Python pandas literally if you have a

799
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,200
CSV file this is all I do is I just say

800
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,720
read the CSV it's a one-liner and you

801
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,860
bring it and this is what gave the

802
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,900
engineers referencing how easy it is to

803
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,210
bring in a CSV file and put it into a

804
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,380
data frame so you can modify

805
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,240
automatically through code so this is

806
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,310
returned I mean this

807
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,750
didn't take very long already right now

808
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,160
and look at this I mean if you're a bug

809
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,050
bounty you have a domain a target a wild

810
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,940
card and you look look at this this is

811
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,250
this is Microsoft com wild card and we

812
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,020
know keep in mind we never touched

813
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,670
Microsoft systems this is purely off

814
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,320
with just a publicly available data set

815
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,300
that we queried so no interaction with

816
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,080
the target it brought back 18,000 rows

817
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,580
so we have 18,000 rows the load into

818
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,590
memory right now and what we want to do

819
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,270
we want to map this so right now this is

820
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,800
this is neat enough in itself and we if

821
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,570
you talk recon this is pretty cool and

822
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,270
we had this in like under a minute but

823
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,350
we're gonna go ahead and run the next

824
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,330
step and this is I believe this is going

825
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,470
to map it's gonna start doing GOI

826
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,150
geolocation so it's it's actually using

827
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,950
the Mac Mac's mind database that you

828
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,540
might be familiar with saying it's the

829
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,850
I'm using the free light copy that just

830
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,550
um compares it to a database or to the

831
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,860
local 82 megabyte file and what I just

832
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,350
did was I took every one of these IP

833
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,780
addresses ran it all 18,000 of these

834
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,580
against the max mind and now I have a

835
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,590
latitude and longitude of every one of

836
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,140
these with just a couple lines of code

837
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,790
there's there's some more behind this

838
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,560
gate location that you can review and do

839
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,590
but the goal of everything if you see if

840
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,360
you go through my Jupiter notebooks out

841
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,430
here and it says core functions these

842
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,890
are written agnostic to the process so

843
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,020
these are not specific to projects owner

844
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,760
or anything like that this is written so

845
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,950
that way you can pass things in and get

846
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,630
the same

847
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,430
entries back so all I did was I took

848
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,710
this data frame here and I passed the

849
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,450
entire data frame because let's make it

850
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,920
easy let's just pass the whole beta

851
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,870
frame at this function and all I did

852
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,240
here this value this is the column that

853
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,610
has the IP addresses in here so if you

854
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,710
go and look these IP addresses all I'm

855
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,740
specifying in this command is the is the

856
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,900
IP addresses so any CSV file that you

857
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,820
have that you want you can use this code

858
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,520
if it's just an output of a CSV file

859
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,340
that has 5,000 IPS or target lists or

860
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,260
indicators of compromised things like

861
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,030
that you can run it through this command

862
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,040
in geo locate all of these which is

863
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,710
pretty neat as returns that back and

864
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,380
then this one is going to do some

865
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,420
continued preparations I believe oh this

866
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,860
just aggregates the data sells pretty

867
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,690
fast eighteen thousand lines of code

868
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,120
aggregated here so we can kind of start

869
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,550
to summarize the concentrations of

870
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,960
latitude longitude

871
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,539
the different pieces and then if we jump

872
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,999
into this next one the data set we're

873
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,619
going we're gonna run this last line and

874
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:05,970
this is just gonna produce the heat map

875
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,100
using its using the Google Maps API and

876
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,279
this is and it just that just to point

877
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,389
this out if I wouldn't have talked so

878
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:13,740
much during this if I would just shut my

879
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,450
mouth and just click buttons we would

880
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,549
have had this heat map for Microsoft

881
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,309
calm in under two minutes total and I

882
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:21,749
mean this is a global heat map now

883
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:23,429
interactive map where I can zoom in on

884
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,340
and you can look at their entire

885
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,950
external attack surface all within a

886
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,080
couple minutes of of some queries and

887
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,580
just think about the value that you

888
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,129
could give C or C so at your company and

889
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:36,240
say we can run this on a case-by-case

890
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,029
basis and I mean let me zoom in it's

891
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:41,429
just this area here I mean some of its

892
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,529
gonna depending on I mean you know how

893
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,869
eyepiece maps some are gonna be based on

894
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,190
the center of cities others are gonna

895
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,110
show like there's a must be Quincy

896
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,249
Washington there's something here but

897
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:51,990
he's used a min you can see that you can

898
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,700
see red min see Seattle I mean it's

899
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,379
pretty detailed you can zoom in own in

900
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,690
and pretty pretty neat stuff so I'm I

901
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,740
don't know I thought it was pretty

902
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,230
awesome and so you can do that with any

903
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,230
company though

904
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,050
the blog I think goes on to compare the

905
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,300
top five cloud providers in there

906
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,340
so let's let's jump back to our slides

907
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,870
so that that's just one thing you can

908
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,460
use and I have I recommend at least

909
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,960
pulling some of the snippets of code out

910
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,820
and see where if you're working into it

911
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,890
in a security operation center and you

912
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,750
can like that where you can where you

913
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,570
can use these things so it's from bed to

914
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,340
the next one so let's say I don't want

915
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,050
to deal with big data Ryan I don't care

916
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,670
about IP addresses I don't care about

917
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,230
heat mapping but you run an application

918
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,880
security program where you're a manager

919
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,320
that's just dealing with spreadsheets

920
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,270
this is another example where we're

921
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,700
using these huge scientific computing

922
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,650
tools we're gonna process about a

923
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,440
probably like a 3,300 kilobyte

924
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,600
spreadsheet that just tracks our besom

925
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,940
score so besom is just one way you can

926
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,470
measure an application security program

927
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,820
called building security and maturity

928
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,750
model I like it

929
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,970
I've used the extensively in my past and

930
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,890
and so what we're gonna do is we're

931
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,240
gonna jump back over into this notebook

932
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,710
but this is kind of the outputs of of

933
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,810
how do we how do we talk to this let's

934
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,970
let's jump into this one this is more

935
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,280
lightweight now so this is a I just have

936
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,440
it in check this out it's not even a CSV

937
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,480
this can pandas can read indirectly

938
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,370
Excel spreadsheets so you don't even

939
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,290
have to worry about formatting or doing

940
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,390
this just bring it in read underscore

941
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,790
excel that's the function and you could

942
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,740
you could put a parenthesis here and

943
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,840
just read it in I went ahead to call out

944
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,190
some of the other things like hey I

945
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,870
didn't want to use all the columns and

946
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,280
the spreadsheet so I just said use these

947
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,560
I wanted to specifically convert them

948
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,720
over to some strings floats integers and

949
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,070
things for some of the calculations so

950
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,960
just some that I prefer to do and you

951
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,310
can you can replicate that so if you

952
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,720
have any Excel spreadsheet you want to

953
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,520
try the poll in the pandas dataframe

954
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,070
here's some example right here let's run

955
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,450
this one so all this did is this

956
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,980
literally just pulled in the spreadsheet

957
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,020
and this just shows the data frame here

958
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,460
so this is what it looks like today it's

959
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,650
it's just here's the activities in the B

960
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,510
sim here's the activity the level and

961
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,610
then this is where the measurements come

962
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,880
in so currently true means this is where

963
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,040
we're at and then I would say from a

964
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,570
projected standpoint this is where I

965
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,890
want to be in the future and this comes

966
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,840
down to that metrics play of how can we

967
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,910
tell metrics on a regular automated

968
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,770
continuous basis well you can use

969
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,510
something like this tool to do that so

970
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,800
this is our target so you're obviously

971
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,240
you have to update the raw data

972
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,770
somewhere whether that's in a system

973
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,750
ideally you're not updated in a

974
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,160
spreadsheet but you're actually query in

975
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,800
like

976
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,330
your vulnerability management tool or

977
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,800
your application security tool and you

978
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,150
just keep it in there or even like an

979
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,800
archer for my risk management different

980
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,660
things you can just make the API call

981
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,610
pull it in you get this in the Eiger

982
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,230
score so let's let's just say we want to

983
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,720
process it so this is plotly here it's

984
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,610
running it pulls in the scores does some

985
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,570
calculations and should take a second

986
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:36,930
here

987
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,840
there goes and then with literally two

988
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,400
button clicks I have the updated data

989
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,170
that I need from a metric standpoint

990
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,910
there's no kind of where we're at here's

991
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,830
the future maturity here's where at

992
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,110
today and it's just it's pretty neat and

993
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,060
simplify and Wyatt let's make metrics

994
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,470
easier that's how we tell stories that's

995
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,760
how we get better that's how you

996
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,180
quantify money spends future future

997
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,980
investment for your security program so

998
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,780
I can't emphasize enough the importance

999
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,640
of that and just how simple it can be

1000
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,140
over and over when you have to run this

1001
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,790
month by month and you want to move

1002
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,650
forward in your career don't do this one

1003
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,420
thing once there's no there's no gain of

1004
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,980
manipulating spreadsheets but if you can

1005
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,020
pull it in here say put this on a cron

1006
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,670
job to run every 30 days in the cloud

1007
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,500
kick it off with a lambda and you have

1008
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,220
it and then let's load it into an s3 and

1009
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,240
advertise it and you give your

1010
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,830
management the link and anytime they go

1011
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,300
to it you could run this every day if

1012
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,980
you wanted and you have real-time

1013
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,570
metrics then that way they never have to

1014
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,310
ask you you don't ever have to ask them

1015
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,230
and they're pretty excited that this can

1016
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,640
be a win for them if they ever need it

1017
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,720
on the fly I think we have some more

1018
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,350
examples here let's let's see it really

1019
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,910
comes down so this is this is kind of a

1020
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,460
fun one there's the the CVE database and

1021
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,830
if you've ever gone out to the CV

1022
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,140
information there's actually we'll jump

1023
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,730
into and show it but this is another

1024
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,930
thing I'm talking about the same

1025
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,460
questions your patch management your

1026
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,960
vulnerability management seem probably

1027
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,370
as always thinking are we so busy over

1028
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,780
the holidays why does everything bad

1029
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,300
happen over the end of the year that

1030
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,980
seems like that's always the joke and

1031
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,050
the question is it feels like that and

1032
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,310
is it just because we're antsy to get

1033
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,540
out of the office we don't wanna have to

1034
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,250
pull back in or is there data that can

1035
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,409
support that and then from looking at it

1036
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,330
from your management perspectives they

1037
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,040
you need to be able to tell them we need

1038
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,510
to increase staffing to deal with

1039
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,699
security incidents potential issues make

1040
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,800
sure we have people on deck to help us

1041
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,150
at these times of the year that's a

1042
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,300
that's a projected value metric that you

1043
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,340
can actually do and share and then from

1044
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,168
a CSO standpoint the see some might say

1045
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:30,870
wire wire vulnerability counts increase

1046
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,489
over time I thought we invested this

1047
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,050
many hundred thousand dollars in your

1048
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,270
program Ryan why are you doing a bad job

1049
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,129
on this this is where you turn to your

1050
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:41,850
leadership and say check this out let's

1051
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:42,750
let's do this

1052
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,000
well it's let's look at the CV so this

1053
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,879
actually calls this does a live W get to

1054
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,010
the mitre downloads and there's an all

1055
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,290
item CSV so we can go there and I hired

1056
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,210
you download it's 82 megabytes so it I

1057
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,918
just ran it says file already exists no

1058
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,600
need to download so we're gonna do here

1059
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,250
is we're gonna pull in this 82 megabyte

1060
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,060
CSV of every CV that historically has

1061
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,190
ever been captured in this system so

1062
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,840
here it is there's there's a hundred and

1063
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,970
just look at how fast that would see

1064
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,260
that we just loaded this thing so one

1065
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,730
hundred seventy three thousand rows

1066
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,370
these are all individual CDs now some of

1067
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,600
these are Canada that some of these are

1068
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,010
approved but just the matter of data

1069
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,780
these are the these are the wines we

1070
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,340
have into a data frame so we can start

1071
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,690
processing it and we might want to

1072
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,220
answer those questions we just like that

1073
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,470
in that previous slide let's let's run

1074
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,330
the equivalent of let's see how many of

1075
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,880
these occur per year and just a note on

1076
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,530
this next command I'm not calling any

1077
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,090
other functions from other notebooks so

1078
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,620
this is literally five lines of code

1079
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,710
that can take the CSV input and tell us

1080
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,950
a story so now these couple lines this

1081
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,410
tells us exactly how many C V's there

1082
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,660
have been per year so you can look and

1083
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,380
see 1999 249 2019 was the highest

1084
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,550
historic number of C V's published at

1085
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,990
24,000 and then if you look at 2020

1086
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,190
we're halfway through were actually only

1087
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,870
at eleven thousand so we're we're

1088
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,610
trending a little bit for probably the

1089
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,530
first year in the history of C D eath I

1090
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,070
believe we may and under but but maybe

1091
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,750
maybe that's a story but we don't know

1092
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,720
that projected wise it's it's June we

1093
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,880
want to see so let's let's figure out we

1094
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,220
have now how many years that that's 21

1095
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,260
years of data let's see what our

1096
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,670
projections are for the remainder of the

1097
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,740
year looks like so this is what three

1098
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,900
more lines of code and then now we have

1099
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,390
a count of these 20 years which months

1100
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,250
had the most C V's released and

1101
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,470
published well we look here that first

1102
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,820
question of why does it always feel like

1103
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,990
we're getting hit with everything over

1104
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,190
the holidays look at this 22,000 in

1105
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,020
December 20,000 in January that's why

1106
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,550
we're so busy you look at kind of the

1107
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,130
summer months everybody takes a break

1108
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,260
11,000 in in May June I mean it slows

1109
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,310
down a minute

1110
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,800
almost doubles and doubles like you get

1111
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,450
half your vulnerabilities published in

1112
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,310
December and January that's a pretty

1113
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,750
strong story from the resourcing

1114
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,430
standpoint from your preparation Staffie

1115
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,560
and that's a data-driven metric that we

1116
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,420
can tell a story and stand behind and

1117
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,650
that's where we struggle a lot of times

1118
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,020
as a as a professional is we can't

1119
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,820
always stand behind it's just gut feel

1120
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,770
or I know it always feels this way well

1121
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,330
why does it feel that way this is just

1122
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,610
one example of a story then hey if if

1123
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,650
somebody doesn't like to look at tables

1124
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,690
then here's a here's a chart does this

1125
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,340
speak this is something you put in the

1126
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,560
board room and show why are your see so

1127
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,910
at least probably not board level but

1128
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,560
this is why we need to invest more in

1129
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,480
our vulnerability management program

1130
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,640
because the vulnerabilities that we face

1131
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,370
are increasing exponentially

1132
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,200
year-over-year and in just the way they

1133
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,640
tell a story make you better and you

1134
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,410
know how impressive that is to see so

1135
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,630
the walk in and share that story you

1136
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,010
better believe if there's money

1137
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,510
available in a budget and you come with

1138
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,730
a data-driven story to tell you're

1139
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,230
probably going to be successful in

1140
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,070
getting that investment

1141
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:50,599
let's see what else we had so this is

1142
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,160
all right so this is one I'm I'm pretty

1143
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,079
excited about it I don't know if anybody

1144
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,329
here watched my derbycon talk last year

1145
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:58,339
this is a this is really a bill about

1146
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:00,140
boss of that so I hit a lot of these

1147
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,609
similar things it's pretty similar to

1148
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:03,499
that but one of the things that I wanted

1149
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:05,390
to do and accomplished was common crawl

1150
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,309
I knew about it I knew was out there and

1151
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:09,140
I wanted to say how do we tap into this

1152
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,239
as somebody that has been bug bounties

1153
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,650
in the past we're just from an

1154
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,869
application security perspective it just

1155
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:17,239
seems so neat to be able to say I can

1156
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,119
query this data set of cached content

1157
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:22,249
without having to touch the target ever

1158
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:24,410
and see historically year over year

1159
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,059
month over month what changes that

1160
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,979
occurred I want to be able to do that

1161
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:30,349
and so I finally this past month I've

1162
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,140
probably been my working my security

1163
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,599
research time has been about 11 p.m. to

1164
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,940
2 a.m. and I'll even say this past week

1165
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,829
what we had I mean I don't know if

1166
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:41,420
anybody else's in there don't know

1167
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,039
that's watching this but we had

1168
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,739
minecraft and her update or another

1169
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,900
update released this this week and I

1170
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,549
barely played that so I can't wait till

1171
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:50,809
next week we're gonna we're gonna be

1172
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:52,400
stayin up playing a lot of that but I've

1173
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,049
been working on this common crawl work

1174
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:56,390
because I just wanted it to work and so

1175
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,249
I want to only demonstrate this and it's

1176
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:00,440
pretty neat there's some speed issues

1177
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,910
with this one a little bit depending on

1178
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,799
what you try to do well let's let's walk

1179
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,359
through this and see if it works I think

1180
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,130
this is pretty cool and what I want you

1181
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,269
either to do is just really think

1182
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:10,219
through all the different things we can

1183
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,539
do with this so we're gonna we're on

1184
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:14,619
there let's let's do this

1185
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,160
this

1186
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,260
just the database command so this would

1187
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,849
be where you would go back into Athena

1188
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:21,980
and run these three queries to set this

1189
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,690
up so super easy it's three three

1190
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,910
queries it takes a couple minutes this

1191
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,470
is another one where we can we can

1192
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,059
choose what what target do we want to go

1193
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:31,430
for I actually tried the jungle dot IO

1194
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,819
site it has not been cached into common

1195
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:36,500
crawl yet so I couldn't run it against

1196
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,599
that one so we're rather than picking I

1197
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:41,569
actually ran DEFCON org last night in it

1198
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:44,420
returned I think it was about seventy

1199
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,099
thousand results and they started

1200
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:48,049
processing it and it was taken I mean it

1201
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:49,609
took about twenty minutes to get through

1202
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:51,230
things so it takes some time but the

1203
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,880
value is worth the time and when I say

1204
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,079
twenty minutes there's a lot of tools

1205
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,180
that he doing in raishin things that run

1206
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,890
this is completely not touching many

1207
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,109
systems and running so pretty neat so

1208
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:01,220
we're gonna choose we're just going to

1209
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,619
do Derby con-com and we're gonna run it

1210
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,240
it and it comes back in a reasonable

1211
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,420
time so it's it's kicked off now

1212
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,280
I should have quit I should have cleared

1213
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,290
my output before this but let's

1214
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,320
let's try you know what we're gonna go

1215
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,060
up here to Colonel this is how you clear

1216
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,650
all your outputs to restart and clear

1217
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,210
output we're gonna we're gonna try this

1218
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,200
from scratch so there's no

1219
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,240
pre-determined information in here

1220
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,320
surrender no let's kick this off this is

1221
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,730
one I'm really excited about it it took

1222
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,070
a lot I didn't I don't know if I found

1223
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,870
anywhere that anybody is doing this from

1224
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,290
a security perspective um at a at a

1225
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,570
large scale other than some higher-level

1226
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,760
analytics around it so I think this is

1227
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,090
pretty neat all right so now we have our

1228
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,250
execution ID so we got that returned so

1229
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,660
let's let's kick this off and start

1230
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,940
saying are you done are you done are you

1231
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,060
done

1232
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,589
so we're just gonna wait on our results

1233
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:57,599
Eternia probably this one takes some

1234
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,930
takes a few seconds but it's not too bad

1235
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,549
I'm really excited about all the grant

1236
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:03,750
tools and everything that's been

1237
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,339
displayed today because you'll see the

1238
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:06,809
final output I haven't been able to

1239
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:09,000
build a lot on to this but the biggest

1240
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,559
thing is what what do you do with a file

1241
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,630
structure of HTML files how do we search

1242
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,490
against those is there an inventory of a

1243
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,289
dictionary of key things that we look at

1244
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:17,549
use a lot of times you look for

1245
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:19,109
different things like sequel injection

1246
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,569
you look more at source code we have to

1247
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:23,549
look we have to tailor this more so to

1248
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,339
HTML aspx type things so you could look

1249
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,079
for comments you can look for passwords

1250
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,210
you could look for and then also this

1251
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,369
common crawl we'll see when the results

1252
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:34,130
return to but it actually captures

1253
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,779
parameters so it's somehow if it does

1254
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:38,460
like the referral and it has a parameter

1255
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,440
you can actually query against this

1256
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,089
database for certain parameters so

1257
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:43,319
here's our here's our data that came

1258
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:46,410
back so it has 579 sites for Derby

1259
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:50,039
tyrannous and like just just how cool is

1260
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,510
this I mean we didn't even do a spider

1261
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,670
or anything against this domain at all

1262
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,140
this is literally just data that's

1263
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,210
sitting out there saying come get me and

1264
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,640
we did and so here and you'll see

1265
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,410
there's a lot of duplicates here this is

1266
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,089
what I think it's pretty neat too from

1267
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:05,369
from a security perspective if you're

1268
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:06,809
gonna bug down these and things you can

1269
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:08,069
actually see the reason this is

1270
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:09,990
different is because these are not

1271
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,180
distinct values so this record length is

1272
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,369
different size which means that this

1273
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:17,730
page changed between whatever month this

1274
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,460
is 2013 the two thousand does look

1275
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,349
similar but you can you can kind of see

1276
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:24,089
over time how pages change if they've

1277
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:26,160
been cached multiple times so if there

1278
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,839
ever was an issue in a page that they

1279
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,069
went back and fixed let's say they

1280
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:30,539
accidentally put credentials in there in

1281
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:32,220
a comment or something you can actually

1282
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,839
go back and find any comment crawl and

1283
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,190
then what you can do is you can try to

1284
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,660
validate those credentials even though

1285
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,400
they're they've been removed in the

1286
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,200
webpage did they go back and change the

1287
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,759
password they change the accounts and

1288
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,230
and that's always there's always things

1289
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,369
like that that can be helpful maybe

1290
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:46,170
bills and internally exposed API in

1291
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,720
their call maybe it was my javascript

1292
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,819
file that that's what and it actually

1293
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,109
doesn't pull back a lot of the

1294
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:53,279
JavaScript but you'll have all the

1295
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,279
references to them if they still exist

1296
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:57,000
alright so now that we have the data

1297
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,470
pulled back let's let's see we can do

1298
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,019
with this so now this one is going to go

1299
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:03,830
through and what this does this

1300
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,750
the part that I haven't seen a lot of

1301
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,850
you can find a lot of examples just

1302
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,470
returning results like this this

1303
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,540
actually goes through we're gonna kick

1304
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,550
it off it starts going through and it

1305
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,120
pulls all the areas into a data frame

1306
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,490
and gives you the URLs to download the

1307
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,590
exact HTML page so rather than just

1308
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,390
query and against the index of content

1309
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,160
we're going through now and we're

1310
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,860
getting all the basically the s3 file

1311
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,630
locations for these pages

1312
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,900
it's iterating through and let's see if

1313
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,610
this comes let's hope this finishes if

1314
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,560
not I'll jump in and show you because it

1315
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,980
takes a lot takes a little bit of time

1316
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,060
but what it's doing is it's going

1317
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,650
through and it's actually printing that

1318
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,530
output into a file on the file system so

1319
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,970
I have my Jupiter notebook here you can

1320
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,880
see the file system it's writing a leave

1321
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,500
it's into the temp directory yeah

1322
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,600
because you can see in my DEFCON 2 so if

1323
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,880
you have like here's the DEF CON pages

1324
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,990
that I ran last night

1325
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,570
if you jumping here's the directory

1326
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,250
structure so you picture like what the

1327
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,630
website looks like and here's the HTML

1328
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,820
files so you have all your HTML these

1329
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,950
are just these are just the plain text

1330
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,990
looking at the file system here so what

1331
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,040
it's going through is it's looking at

1332
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,900
Derby con it's pulling here's here's the

1333
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,420
structure the of the website then here's

1334
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,210
all your HTML behind it so once this

1335
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,070
finishes one thing you can always do

1336
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,630
that's handy is you can see this little

1337
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,370
hourglass so you know that it's still

1338
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,750
running and doing something because a

1339
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,490
lot of times it's well I'm just

1340
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,990
wondering what's going on it's this

1341
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,480
hourglass can be helpful especially if

1342
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,280
you didn't write outputs as it goes on

1343
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,110
regularly to know and we failed

1344
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,930
well yeah process of structures I'll fix

1345
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,940
that for everybody on there it was

1346
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,220
working last night but either way here's

1347
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,290
the here's what it comes out with so the

1348
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,080
next the next step up here we have - we

1349
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,700
always had the plan for some field demo

1350
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,060
right

1351
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,790
oh I know why I added this processed

1352
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,700
records just because I was getting tired

1353
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,440
of waiting for Def Con and I had no

1354
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,390
inputs or insight since I was running it

1355
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,890
way before it's finished I believe

1356
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,510
they're still finished and it just

1357
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,250
failed on that so we'll go ahead and

1358
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,560
what this does is this next command will

1359
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,080
process and it actually tarz all this up

1360
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,210
so we have it running in a stage maker

1361
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,130
notebook on the on the actual notebook

1362
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:11,540
instance we don't really want it there

1363
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,860
if you want to pull it down locally so

1364
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,840
you can run some GUP and whatever tools

1365
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,190
you want run it through your source code

1366
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,700
analysis tools and

1367
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,100
static analyzers just correct a grandpa

1368
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,690
prostate so what this does is it does it

1369
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,930
tarz it up into date output car and then

1370
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,520
literally now let's go and let's see

1371
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,290
this tar file is now right here written

1372
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:33,300
seconds ago I I didn't clear out the DEF

1373
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,340
CON file so we have all that too but we

1374
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,840
can now download it to our system that

1375
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,270
should save but you download it

1376
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:51,670
bottom here well it's a lot

1377
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,010
I should've limited my output too that's

1378
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,660
why use trim and tail and things like

1379
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,849
that those are all these are all notes

1380
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:02,010
learn from learn from my mistakes here

1381
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,650
all right I think we're tore to the

1382
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:08,000
bottom but you can see all of these file

1383
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,770
I mean there's does a lot of HTML you

1384
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,320
can do and then what it does is it tars

1385
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,640
it up for you and then you can download

1386
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,170
it locally and open into Visual Studio

1387
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,520
code or whatever you want

1388
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,290
running tools against that directory

1389
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,240
structure there the only caveat is that

1390
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,400
it's the HTML so you know if you load

1391
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,280
HTML and it references external

1392
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,420
javascript files and things like that

1393
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,440
it's actually going to make the

1394
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,119
call-outs to try to load the images and

1395
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,310
things so if you try to load a page that

1396
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,470
you don't want that target to know don't

1397
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:34,910
open it in a browser or something like

1398
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,710
that opening a text editor searched

1399
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,030
there because it's going to make all the

1400
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,770
calls because it's it's running item

1401
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,130
HTML file so just let me be aware of and

1402
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,180
one of the one of the last things I want

1403
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,300
to show is this is just some other

1404
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,650
queries that you can run directly once

1405
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,329
you get it set up so you could run and

1406
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:52,430
but maybe before you process it you want

1407
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,980
to see how many distinct URLs we have

1408
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,599
for this before you start downloading

1409
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,099
and running my Jupiter notebook and

1410
00:46:58,099 --> 00:46:59,390
you're gonna sit for hours and do all

1411
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:00,619
that processing so you can throw it in

1412
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:02,630
there this one's pretty cool we're gonna

1413
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,339
run this one I don't know I didn't I

1414
00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:05,599
didn't plan for this one the head -

1415
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,119
let's let's try this we can we can run

1416
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:09,589
this directly in stage maker because I

1417
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:11,690
don't have a command or directly in a

1418
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,069
FEMA because I don't have a command

1419
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:15,170
that's going to query that one directly

1420
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,460
from the Jupiter notebook but you

1421
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,780
literally could just paste that query

1422
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,700
into the the query statements I have a

1423
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,770
blog and adjust some of the code let's

1424
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:24,260
let's do this it's where such paste this

1425
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,450
query into hearing this is me this is

1426
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,329
saying that search the entire data set

1427
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:31,760
of all your historic common crawl data

1428
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,190
for a parameter called CMD equals

1429
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,660
because wouldn't be cool if we found one

1430
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,579
of those let's let's run this yeah sure

1431
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:42,170
should have planned before live live

1432
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:44,619
demos here let's see if the other table

1433
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:48,069
it does work

1434
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,940
if this doesn't work I'll stick Satan on

1435
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,400
sharing up the old there we go it was

1436
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,140
just my comment and neither the dashes

1437
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,880
instead of a pound sign when you bring

1438
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,680
it over from in from a Python file I

1439
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,670
don't think this takes very long to run

1440
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,140
in what you could do to it I mean you

1441
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,700
have the example queries now of how to

1442
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,590
run against the domain so you could

1443
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,599
literally put select to this files where

1444
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,240
domain equals and then and so that way

1445
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,680
you don't have to pull back every single

1446
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,390
file and compute that you have but if

1447
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:26,770
you're if you default on the air

1448
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,450
reconnaissance or red teaming right I

1449
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,430
think this is this is one of the coolest

1450
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,980
things I've seen in a while so we'll

1451
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,330
give this a second set to come back

1452
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:38,770
which I come in a minute here yeah we're

1453
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,970
coming closer to the end of the

1454
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,310
presentation so well I think yeah we'll

1455
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,430
have a few minutes to spare let's see 41

1456
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,609
seconds I think it takes about a minute

1457
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:49,510
we'll give it I'll give it 10 more

1458
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,940
seconds and watch some it's I think it's

1459
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,109
more exciting than watching paint dry

1460
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:55,480
but paint but a new painted room does

1461
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,750
does look pretty nice if it goes over a

1462
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,950
minute we'll just finish up them which

1463
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,040
icon this in a few seconds

1464
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,980
I will come back to it so if we're

1465
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,390
trying to solve some of these challenges

1466
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,740
I think one of the things just with

1467
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,660
building a program and improving is that

1468
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,010
competition for talent people are

1469
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,540
leaving all the time you lose a lot of

1470
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,650
your best people and they're being

1471
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,390
recruited you go day to day it's

1472
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,950
important to keep them happy they keep

1473
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:20,260
them working on things that are

1474
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,490
important to them and it's also giving

1475
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,710
them time to invest in themselves and

1476
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,090
make themselves better and if you can do

1477
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,920
that and cater to that you're going to

1478
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,630
have somebody that can knows they can be

1479
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,980
successful because a lot of us are

1480
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,540
really competitive we want to see a

1481
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,790
program succeed we don't want to jump

1482
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,530
around time over time and it's just

1483
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,870
sometimes the stress of the job be the

1484
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,000
pressure that redundancy the mundane

1485
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,010
that's boring and a lot of us have come

1486
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,720
from the red team in the pen testing the

1487
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,790
backgrounds where we don't want boring

1488
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,500
we want to be solving these problems we

1489
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,090
don't want to be stuck in this you're

1490
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,040
expected to do this do this automate

1491
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,900
that automate the mundane use those

1492
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,330
skills use that talent and do that so

1493
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,500
that's that's one part of the

1494
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,700
competition but I think program

1495
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,080
continuity is a bigger thing and that's

1496
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,120
not just saying like your leadership

1497
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,860
leaves on I know those last stats were

1498
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,930
around CISOs but how do you maintain

1499
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,640
program continuity what I just showed

1500
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,990
you the things that if you were doing

1501
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,340
these examples and a spreadsheet

1502
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,840
month-over-month and you leave the

1503
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,570
company that knowledge is lost now you

1504
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,130
can say I've invested in the automation

1505
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,420
I've written down everything I do

1506
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,890
there's continuity I'm not as critical

1507
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,540
as critical to the current operations of

1508
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,610
the organization but you are such an

1509
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,110
impact if you were to leave because

1510
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,690
you've fixed all of them when being the

1511
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,940
day-to-day and you are actually an asset

1512
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,800
to them that you can focus on the future

1513
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,900
in the future building in the new the

1514
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,550
innovative that you can move your

1515
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,110
business your company forward and I

1516
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,820
think that's the part of the messaging

1517
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,310
of try to solve them in vain keep that

1518
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,260
going so that there is continuity and

1519
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,910
then also if somebody does leave a key

1520
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,500
resource it's not well what do we start

1521
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,600
how do i I now need to take on the work

1522
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,980
of three people you know it's just been

1523
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,330
automated anyway so now it's just

1524
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:54,100
stepping up and finding somebody with

1525
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,300
the right amount of knowledge to

1526
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,040
continue this and move us forward so

1527
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,500
something to think about

1528
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,850
and then the last one is continuous risk

1529
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,380
measurement we're terrible at weave it

1530
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,420
snapshots a point in time of will page

1531
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,740
somebody to come and do a maturity

1532
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,000
assess mary pentest

1533
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,710
I just showed you a few examples where

1534
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:10,000
you can run queries in a matter of

1535
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,770
minutes to look at your attack surface

1536
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,750
time over time that's that's free I mean

1537
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,300
this entire set up costs about under

1538
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:16,839
probably

1539
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:19,029
five dollars now I will say one of the

1540
00:51:19,029 --> 00:51:20,739
caveats in using sage makers that

1541
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:22,210
usually shut down your instance when

1542
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,469
you're not running it because it will

1543
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:25,029
rack up cost I mean you're paying for a

1544
00:51:25,029 --> 00:51:26,950
server to run persistently so make sure

1545
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,299
you set up some sort of lambda or

1546
00:51:28,299 --> 00:51:29,710
something that's gonna disconnect or

1547
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,509
move it and shut it down because if you

1548
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:33,460
only use it and you start it up whenever

1549
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,059
you need it

1550
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:36,039
it's literally you're talking dollars a

1551
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:37,869
month and if you run it all the time I

1552
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:39,430
mean you might rack up one or two

1553
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,319
hundred dollars so just be careful with

1554
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:42,640
those things especially as you're

1555
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,950
working with cloud but if you are smart

1556
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,539
about it you shut down your resources

1557
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:48,880
there's unlimited compute capability

1558
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,410
opportunities within being able to

1559
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,359
leverage the latest greatest innovative

1560
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,519
products services solutions that

1561
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:56,710
businesses and companies are adopting

1562
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,119
anyway so whether or not you know it

1563
00:51:58,119 --> 00:51:59,859
from a security standpoint your peers

1564
00:51:59,859 --> 00:52:01,329
around you're using it let's use these

1565
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:03,450
tools to to move the industry forward

1566
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,160
check out let's check out our results

1567
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,319
here well there we go we got it so these

1568
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,130
are all the different URLs now in common

1569
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,289
crawl that have CMD in the in the end so

1570
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:15,609
if you're just looking for one bug Don

1571
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:18,009
you mean this now this you definitely

1572
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,390
don't want to start targeting all these

1573
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,489
but let's say they have maybe they have

1574
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:23,349
responsibility schools or programs and

1575
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,700
things I mean you can now we can start

1576
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,930
targeting and seeing maybe there's a

1577
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,849
framework under here that a lot of these

1578
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:29,890
are using the common PHP library that

1579
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,569
just has CMD exposed or how its

1580
00:52:31,569 --> 00:52:33,969
referenced so there's a there's quite a

1581
00:52:33,969 --> 00:52:36,160
few results here so it there's not oh

1582
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,739
yeah we scanned through so that was two

1583
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,069
minutes and six seconds and we searched

1584
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:43,390
three hundred and fifty four gigabytes

1585
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,279
of data so that's not too bad that was

1586
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:47,200
pretty fast but you could put in

1587
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,759
whatever Euro query you wanted and you

1588
00:52:48,759 --> 00:52:50,019
can search for those so I'm just

1589
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:51,190
thinking thinking in terms of

1590
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,619
opportunities don't if you do if you do

1591
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:55,839
use this technique and get some good

1592
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,859
bounties or something let me know

1593
00:52:56,859 --> 00:52:59,410
that's exciting I'd be just as excited

1594
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,359
for you to forget it anyway so I'm

1595
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,130
definitely some things can take aways

1596
00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:07,839
that wraps up this presentation if

1597
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,130
you're still with me I haven't checked

1598
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,839
discord but hopefully everybody's still

1599
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:11,859
there I think we got a couple minutes

1600
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,630
left here some links but I think I

1601
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,339
already put all everything in discord of

1602
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:17,499
where to access all these resources and

1603
00:53:17,499 --> 00:53:18,999
I I'll hand it back to Homer but I

1604
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:20,289
really appreciated this has been awesome

1605
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:22,829
thank you

1606
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,799
awesome if I can get it from youth thank

1607
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:26,930
you so much

1608
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,619
presentation and thank you for

1609
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:30,539
supporting the DEF CON red team village

1610
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:33,029
and Texas cyber summit so for all the

1611
00:53:33,029 --> 00:53:34,980
attendees out there as Ryan mentioned
