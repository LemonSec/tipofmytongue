1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,000
hi everyone good evening and good

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,750
morning and good afternoon from where a

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,360
part of where you are and I would like

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,420
to welcome you to my talk which is about

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,700
disclosing own abilities to the

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,250
organization responsibly so without

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,529
wasting further time let's scare into

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,480
this so before security I used to

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,420
develop mobile applications web

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,000
application so I had a good experience

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,300
with the DevOps side of the IT so mobile

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,640
applications and web applications had

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,649
really fascinated me towards security

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,770
and currently I am working as a head of

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,890
cyber security for an organization and

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,320
in my free time I do security

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,739
researching so obviously with the

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,930
passage of time you find you try to find

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,620
more and more stuff to learn and I'm on

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,640
constantly on the book to learn more

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,390
about mobile application security or be

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,580
it Android application or is application

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,770
and there are a lot of stuff to learn

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,979
about but I haven't explored the IOT

25
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,490
industry and I look forward to learn

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,369
more about IOT security and AR m as well

27
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,950
so why response with disclosure or why

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,570
we actually talking about responsible

29
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,400
disclosure in our talk so basically

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,299
let's take an example let's think for a

31
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,350
moment that your neighborhood or there's

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,420
a house in your neighborhood dad had

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,329
actually left your there front over or

34
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,360
their back door opening so what would be

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,689
your response to that obviously you will

36
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,990
ask them to close to do or you will call

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,290
them to close it or in a similar place

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,320
and while we talk about information

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,500
security and cyber security when we find

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,910
something that has a unintended response

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,280
we find it something potentially harmful

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,620
or

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,470
harmful for the organization or for the

44
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,670
community so we try to report that to

45
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,220
the organization to make the internet a

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,590
safe place and to secure the

47
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,390
organization or their application or

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,110
their infrastructure in a more better

49
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,489
and efficient way so in my whole

50
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,680
experience while disclosing the

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,049
vulnerabilities I had the opportunity to

52
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:47,370
work fee of the organization one of us

53
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,680
one of one of them was a Mohammed

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,340
organization and the other one was a

55
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,000
corporate organization I would use I I

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,379
cannot use their name actually but but

57
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,819
they come the semi government

58
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,430
organization was something that was

59
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,980
known in the public and I would further

60
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,340
discuss this in my talk the corporate

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,799
organization obviously they were a

62
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,910
subscription based on they had a

63
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,060
subscription based application and that

64
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,530
was huge and the online restaurant that

65
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,040
used to serve desserts coffee or

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,060
whatever you name them so dad was a very

67
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,799
create experiences that was indeed a

68
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,019
great experience so I'll discuss this in

69
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,829
my talk for the tool so let's start with

70
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,400
the government application in this

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,620
government applications not actually

72
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,090
that that was not actually a single

73
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,379
application there were multiple

74
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,410
applications like multiple applications

75
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,199
they had a portal management application

76
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,910
they had a a criminal record background

77
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,590
check application they had a citizen

78
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,930
identifying application which you which

79
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,169
works which used to work on different

80
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,359
protocols let's say it used to take your

81
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,478
CNIC we call it C and IC but that can be

82
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,089
your national national identification

83
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,539
number of whatever number you can name

84
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,580
it so

85
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,900
the hotel management system or the hotel

86
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,180
management application you used to check

87
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,620
their customer like doing the basic kyc

88
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,740
for the customer if he is a criminal or

89
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,860
he or she is a criminal and they are

90
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,039
requesting for a room in the hotel so

91
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,840
they had to do the background through

92
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,289
their mobile application so when we are

93
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:53,819
talking about mobile application

94
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,470
specifically and when it comes to

95
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,490
government we see a lot of stuff in our

96
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,530
daily lives like in my experience I saw

97
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,949
there was no port office kitchen and the

98
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,199
application was clear clearly open like

99
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:16,289
just download the application just run

100
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,539
few tools and you will get the source

101
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:21,110
code and you can build up your own

102
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,979
application you can replicate the

103
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,270
application replace the you know

104
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,190
particularly API keys or whatever keys

105
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,400
you want to replace and it's said it

106
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,860
further because dart applications were

107
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,240
never available on the Google Play Store

108
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,330
and third applications were used by the

109
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,469
excuse me that applications were

110
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:49,529
actually used by the organization that

111
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:53,340
were dealing with the customers dealing

112
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,740
with the citizens and that I had

113
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,159
actually I mean that organization had

114
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,479
actually used to report those stats to

115
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,719
the government organization so my point

116
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,560
again is hard-code api's unfortunately

117
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,360
i'm sorry but they were hard code

118
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,460
hard-coded api keys within the

119
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,990
application code but no SSL pinning

120
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,479
clear stuff exposure of sensitive

121
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,740
information self-explanatory and then

122
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,479
there was a new thing I had actually

123
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,550
found and which was API was API

124
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,909
credentials were hard-coded in the URL

125
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:40,050
yeah that was a new thing so for the

126
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,080
evidence and for just to clear

127
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,889
everything off here you can see in the

128
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,099
screenshot and on the left side you can

129
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:53,909
see it there is a username and a

130
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,050
password that has been that that that is

131
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,530
visible in the application in the

132
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,680
application URL and it is actually

133
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,120
taking the username and password within

134
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,539
the URL and it is also disclosing some

135
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,590
confidential information let's say here

136
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,629
it is disclosing about the IP address of

137
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:25,319
the data set and when while we are using

138
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,449
this application API

139
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:30,229
it will used to actually return the

140
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:33,060
customers or you can say the citizens

141
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,759
confidential information so let's say if

142
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,830
somebody knew my international

143
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,580
information national information number

144
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,969
or you can say national identification

145
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:47,340
number and they had to actually clear

146
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,150
you for that you know information they

147
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,779
could have actually kept everything

148
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:58,219
starting from my grandparents name till

149
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:03,870
my children so that was pretty huge so

150
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,340
with that I would like to share a few

151
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,779
tips for the researchers you see this

152
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:11,490
was something new for me so when I

153
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,250
reverse engineered the application I was

154
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,900
shocked to see that they were actually

155
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,469
using API keys within the URL parameter

156
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:23,639
so that was something very new to me and

157
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,219
I just wanted to share that further it

158
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:30,840
it and then they were few post requests

159
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,559
that hadn't give any unintended response

160
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,779
let's say when I used to pass parameters

161
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,110
or payloads that meant to be for SQL

162
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,199
injection they were actually looking in

163
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:50,220
legit target for SQL injection so I just

164
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,579
didn't go forward with that because that

165
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:53,830
was

166
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,190
something aras I I could I could I

167
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,250
consider it as an outer scope and then

168
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,970
there's something that would actually

169
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,370
emphasize emphasize everyone like when

170
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,130
you reverse engineering the application

171
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,910
specifically the Android application

172
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,090
make sure you match every step you are

173
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,180
performing in the application and the

174
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,410
application you have reverse-engineered

175
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,260
for so let's say you started off with

176
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,910
the splash screen and then there's a

177
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,990
screen that says your user name and

178
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,230
password is required in most of the

179
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,710
cases the application doesn't look for

180
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,280
the mobile device that has been either

181
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,300
rooted or non rooted device or is it or

182
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,710
has I mean SSL pending enabled or

183
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,080
disabled or certificates that they're

184
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,200
installed in the mobile device are their

185
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,380
trusted keys or they're different than

186
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,550
that so while make sure that every step

187
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,590
you perform while reverse engineering

188
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,310
the apks are master with the activities

189
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,490
that you are actually performing in here

190
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,190
inhibited as well so that helps a lot

191
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,190
right obviously so when I when when a

192
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,800
group of guys like I was included at

193
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,410
propose well when we reported this when

194
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,380
ability to determine organization

195
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,650
the response was against our expectation

196
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,940
so let's say mostly the news media

197
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,650
outlets had actually caught this news

198
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,580
pretty quickly and they started to you

199
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,040
know publish their stuff over the

200
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,790
internet like that went really well and

201
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,680
with that when the the chairman or the

202
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,350
CEO of the organization came to know

203
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,610
about this he not actually tried to you

204
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,880
know black mirrors to just take down the

205
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,029
Khan

206
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,620
but also he launched an investigation

207
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,260
for allegedly hacking into their

208
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,769
government servers so what happened next

209
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,310
we all of the members who were actually

210
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,019
working on this application who are

211
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,930
actually going forward with responsible

212
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,730
disclosure so some of them got called

213
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,370
from the law enforcement agencies they

214
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,250
asked him to come in and you know for

215
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,399
the interrogation for allegedly hacking

216
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,700
into their servers and there was a there

217
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,459
was a lot of mental stress like

218
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,740
everybody was shocked that we were

219
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,450
actually helping the government

220
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,579
organization secure their infrastructure

221
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:59,240
secure their applications because like

222
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,579
leaking out like these information was

223
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,910
being leaked out on the Facebook groups

224
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,480
for around $2 to $3 so you can google

225
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,170
that up as well and then the legal

226
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,899
battle starts where they had to register

227
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,670
a case against these guys and they had

228
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,290
to show up in the court and all of that

229
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,690
stuff so that was pretty hectic for us

230
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,570
and at the end of day the case was

231
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:34,250
dismissed and the allegation that were

232
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,190
been put up to where that would be input

233
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,250
up to all of members were dismissed as

234
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,529
well and we learned a great lesson from

235
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,860
this and which is never mess with the

236
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,690
government application speed an Android

237
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,250
application build whatever application

238
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,500
because they take their this thing they

239
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,589
take this very differently they take it

240
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:58,459
as something holding their ego so we all

241
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,630
decided not to do any stuff that

242
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,180
pertains to the government entity so we

243
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,519
just went sideways so that was pretty

244
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,560
harsh experience but again there is a

245
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,160
good experience as well there was this

246
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,890
corporate application which are earlier

247
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,200
discussed had

248
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,750
great number of premium customers so

249
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,660
they had a very great reputation like

250
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,970
they had 1.5 million downloads on their

251
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,550
Android application and iOS application

252
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,500
they had premium services rate include

253
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,540
alerts customized alerts or you can say

254
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,240
some resources they were offering for

255
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,050
the premium customers and the resources

256
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,960
that were not available for the free

257
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,440
users and they had a very great

258
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,750
reputation on the both app stores so

259
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,790
that was a very very very good

260
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,250
application in terms of you know user

261
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,770
experience and the services they were

262
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,590
offering so I had a chat with the

263
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,920
organization and I wanted to disclose

264
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,570
the vulnerabilities in my talk but

265
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,750
unfortunately they didn't allow me to

266
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,300
disclose your abilities so I won't be

267
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,500
actually disclosing these

268
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,890
vulnerabilities in my talk and I would

269
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,180
actually discuss about the

270
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,640
vulnerabilities that were actually

271
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,160
discovered in the application without

272
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,870
naming them or without actually

273
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,010
disclosing the whole information to the

274
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,040
audience but again a limited one just to

275
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,130
make sure that I stand by the rules and

276
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,780
there's not something coming back to me

277
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,780
so there's a tip for researchers our

278
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,500
just put it out for everyone whenever we

279
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,590
are fuzzing the API keys or whenever we

280
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,660
are looking into the API keys of Google

281
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,210
make sure that you cross verify them

282
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,120
while looking into the application let's

283
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,610
say the login mechanism of the

284
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,930
application look into the login

285
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,470
mechanism how the login mechanism is

286
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,450
actually working how it is interacting

287
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,440
with the server let's say in this case

288
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,510
they were using the identity and access

289
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:22,860
management of the Google and they I mean

290
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,250
they had different API keys for the

291
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,890
front-end and a different API key for

292
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,130
the identity XS management so

293
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,120
always look out of the box always look I

294
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,080
was thinking out of the box actually and

295
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,690
make sure that you try you try to fuzz

296
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,720
every parameter that is being posted to

297
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,250
the server that has been requested to

298
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,960
the server so you get a good

299
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,570
understanding of the intended and

300
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,170
unintended response and they try to

301
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,750
create two different accounts so in case

302
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,270
if you are looking for ID or base one

303
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,580
abilities try to you know replace the

304
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,290
tokens replace the keys inside the

305
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:15,290
tokens maybe in this case even though in

306
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,200
this case we were actually trying to

307
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,360
figure out how the tokens were generated

308
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,450
so whenever you are looking into the

309
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,250
tokens look at look how they are

310
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,350
generated so that gives you a great idea

311
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,800
of how to reverse-engineer the tokens

312
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,080
and just replace the relevant

313
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,990
information within the token regenerate

314
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,120
the token and request the data so that

315
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,940
that would actually help you in you know

316
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,390
achieving the pole in attacking the ID

317
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,260
always whenever it is any as usual in a

318
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,240
mirror it as much as you can so I

319
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,230
disclose these vulnerabilities to the

320
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,930
organization and I'm glad they were very

321
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,720
helpful they were very they were very

322
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,120
serious about the security the

323
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,640
application security so I posted this on

324
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,990
there you can say forum or you can say

325
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,319
chat forum and their response was pretty

326
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,329
quick pretty responsible pretty quick

327
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,199
and then they opened the ticket for me

328
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,619
just to make sure that I all the details

329
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,069
are you know shared through a private

330
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,290
medium rather than on a public medium

331
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,370
and to make sure that confidentiality is

332
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:37,040
maintained so when I gave them all the

333
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,100
information about the vulnerabilities

334
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,870
that had I had actually found in the

335
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,940
application and so on and so on

336
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,120
they were very I'm glad they were very

337
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,910
generous to

338
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,430
the world before the vulnerabilities I

339
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,440
have actually found in the application

340
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,380
and then I got an email from their head

341
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,290
of platform engineer inviting to me

342
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,270
invited to actually a bug bounty

343
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,530
platform and just accepting the token of

344
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,140
appreciation from the organization and

345
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,990
that's it that's how my experience was

346
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,630
but that was a very great experience in

347
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,430
disclosing foreign abilities like I was

348
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,760
not expecting any kind of appreciation

349
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,370
from the organization because I didn't

350
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,440
intend to you know just I didn't intend

351
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,310
to you know ask for the monetary benefit

352
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,140
or something so heinous in a similar

353
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,790
terms rather than just to make sure

354
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,810
their security applications and just

355
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,290
recognize that but that recognition was

356
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,370
very very unexpected so this was there

357
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,070
was this online restaurant that used to

358
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,100
take orders from the customer in terms

359
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,170
of you know online takeaways diamonds

360
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,700
and you name it and they had an on

361
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,810
Android application as well so what

362
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,260
actually happened was they were using

363
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,040
base64 authentication in their API

364
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,460
requests so again it was not a SSL there

365
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,560
was no SSL pinning enabled in the

366
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,670
application and if somebody who was in

367
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,760
the same network could have performed

368
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,560
MIT in basic attacks they would have

369
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,870
actually steal the customer information

370
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,210
that is interacting with the server and

371
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,750
so on some of the physics business logic

372
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,120
flaw I have found in the application and

373
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,860
that were pretty serious and so this was

374
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,120
this this this critical control that was

375
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,980
missing where you were actually

376
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,990
purchasing something and it was not

377
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,130
actually like it used to redirect you to

378
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,410
Paige but rather redirecting you to a

379
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,680
page it didn't actually authorize you to

380
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,220
perform that action and in that case

381
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,080
somebody could have actually ordered a

382
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,510
lot of stuff without paying the

383
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,600
restaurant and yeah it used to expose

384
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,930
sensitive information about the customer

385
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,920
and about the application as well so

386
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,910
when I disclose these vulnerabilities to

387
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,410
the organization I call invitation from

388
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,250
the city of the organization and they

389
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,440
wanted to meet me in person so that they

390
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,350
can upskill or UPS not not sorry exactly

391
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,860
she's not an upscale upgrade their

392
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,280
cybersecurity posture and help help them

393
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,250
identify the gaps and fill out the gaps

394
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:03,120
as well so I went in there I spoke to

395
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,570
the CTO of the company and I'm really

396
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,400
thankful to you I'm very thankful to him

397
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,180
he was being so open about the quant

398
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,890
abilities like discussing the

399
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,050
vulnerabilities and you know coming up

400
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,860
with the resolution and so on so on so

401
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,270
big thumbs up to this organization as

402
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:26,720
well so in all of my this journey I

403
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,680
remember a few things while I am

404
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,060
disclosing to an ability store

405
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,210
organization and which is starved so tab

406
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,170
stands for don't be you can understand

407
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,060
it quite clearly act responsibly because

408
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,660
sometimes the organism the organization

409
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,000
takes a lot of time in fixing the

410
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,040
vulnerabilities so let's say there was

411
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,710
an organization I was earlier talking

412
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,610
about where they had actually critical

413
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,320
vulnerabilities in their Android

414
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,930
application and I reported the

415
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,240
vulnerabilities in October 2000 19 and

416
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,160
they had actually fixed their

417
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,910
vulnerabilities in January 2020 so we

418
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,010
have to be realistic about the approach

419
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,710
rather than being aggressive about

420
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,020
something and ask

421
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,440
them again and again Oh like if they

422
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,090
weren't abilities are fixed what

423
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,370
happened with your own abilities what

424
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,310
happened if they are not fixed in time

425
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:30,050
just be responsible I mean whatever

426
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,690
details you have put them out and share

427
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,880
as much as details as possible because

428
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,220
at the end of day they are developers as

429
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,250
well they have to you know have that

430
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,980
knowledge to understand the one ability

431
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,060
quite clearly and to make sure to fix it

432
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,540
in a quickest way and then again respect

433
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,840
the privacy just don't put it out on the

434
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,910
Internet and let's say if you find a

435
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,180
vulnerability and you ask them to fix

436
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,950
that vulnerability and if they don't

437
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,830
give you a response you just wait for a

438
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,270
certain time like there is a a ninety

439
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,420
days program for the Google ability

440
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,580
disclosure program has a 90 days if you

441
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,350
report something to the Google and they

442
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,810
don't fix it in ninety days in a very

443
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,200
exception case in a very exception case

444
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,620
I mean they fixed it was these one it is

445
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,900
within 90 days but when they cannot fix

446
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,000
these whenever it is in 90 days they try

447
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,500
to extend that the period so again you

448
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,370
should be very careful with the

449
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,900
information you are putting out let's

450
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,970
say if you find an ID or based on

451
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,030
ability don't test it on other accounts

452
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,270
don't test it on something you are not

453
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,720
in not authorized to do that again if

454
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,460
you are if you intend to secure the

455
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,890
organization just make sure you follow

456
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,060
the ethical ways and ethical model of

457
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,750
doing things and yes lay within the

458
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,810
boundaries if you find out about code

459
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,990
execution vulnerability on a server

460
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,230
let's say on an application just don't

461
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,010
try to dump their database

462
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,460
because again that's something off the

463
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,360
limits and that can put you in a very in

464
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:39,130
a very critical position so there are

465
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,720
some wearability disclosure programs

466
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,170
that had been initiated by a lot of bug

467
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,230
bounty organizations let's say yes we

468
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,180
had has a very creative and ability

469
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,490
disclosure program finder so you know

470
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,830
what you actually do is you install that

471
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,040
plug-in into your browser and whenever

472
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,100
you are browsing those pages let's say

473
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,340
you are browsing those applications you

474
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,560
just it just gives you an alert or a

475
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,670
notification that this organization has

476
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,400
a responsible disclosure program and if

477
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,830
you find something in this organization

478
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,320
you can report them through this email

479
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,750
or if they are on boarded by the yes we

480
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,570
had platform you would find them there

481
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,690
and you can submit those vulnerabilities

482
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,740
directly on the platform

483
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,490
so I find it pretty helpful in terms of

484
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,030
responsibilities closing the

485
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,450
vulnerabilities to your organization and

486
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,950
sometimes it's hell of a job like

487
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,020
finding the right person to submit the

488
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,700
vulnerabilities but again at the end of

489
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,030
day it's all about being patient and

490
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,140
then bugcrowd and hacker one have their

491
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,030
own vulnerability disclosure programs

492
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,400
and by that you can actually get

493
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,760
disclose the vulnerabilities to the

494
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,080
organization that are on voted by the

495
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,710
relevant platforms but then again there

496
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,390
is something we should actually look for

497
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,150
which is when we are disclosing these

498
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,860
vulnerabilities make sure you disclose

499
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,150
these vulnerabilities to the right

500
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,440
person and to the a person who can

501
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,600
understand it quite clearly let's say if

502
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,230
there is a sales guy all right and you

503
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,610
are disclosing these vulnerabilities to

504
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,920
a sales guy how would he actually

505
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,650
understand

506
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,390
abilities like he's a sales guy I

507
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,640
apologies I'm not just I'm not trying to

508
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,870
you know belittle someone but at the

509
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,630
there is a difference of aspect when it

510
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,330
comes to your technical side so look for

511
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,160
the engineering teams look for the

512
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,350
person who is involved with the

513
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,100
development look for someone who has the

514
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,770
capability to look into the technical

515
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,730
side of the application talk to them and

516
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,800
provide them details as much as you can

517
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,930
so later on that can help them to

518
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:16,880
identify the I mean identify the

519
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,590
vulnerability or the bug in the

520
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,350
application and yeah there's a great

521
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,220
platform in the name of disclose at i/o

522
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,500
you can actually follow that platform

523
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,690
and you can you know just use that

524
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,390
