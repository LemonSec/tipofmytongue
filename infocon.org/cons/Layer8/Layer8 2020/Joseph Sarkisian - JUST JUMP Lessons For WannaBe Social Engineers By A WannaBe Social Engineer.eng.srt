00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,039
not us there's again newer social

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,289
engineer Jase are finding three on

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,590
Twitter first time speak earlier eat a

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,360
second here Larry and for as long as I

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,670
would be coming to lay rate it sucks

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,540
that I always will have to know that I

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,710
missed the first year

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,079
unfortunately so oh well okay why let's

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,920
do this does social engineering steer

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,719
you I know it did me still does lying if

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,489
you save anybody to told you they're not

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,160
scared even to this day I've been doing

20
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,480
it for 10 years it's lying you are you

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,419
interested but not sure how to pave a

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,430
path I'm not sure what skills are

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,750
relevant USC and more info we're bored

24
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,360
on the sound are interesting all

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,369
possibilities common misconceptions and

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,560
falsehoods about social engineering they

27
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,840
are on to you everybody assumes they're

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,920
caught before they're caught right and

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,670
this is something you kind of go out

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,350
over time this is understanding that

31
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,570
it's not as bad as you think

32
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,149
nobody when you walk in the front door

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,548
unless you're just screaming call the

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,110
police things they are a bad guy or a

35
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,939
girl right nobody does

36
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:35,009
so understand that you have more you

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,839
have more room than you think you do

38
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,070
when you walk in that door and you take

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,310
your first few breath and start your

40
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,949
target pretext there's only one path for

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,149
learning not true right there are many

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,060
different things you can learn with an

43
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,340
se right you can end up on a red team

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,110
just be a social engineer be really good

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,720
at fishing right for a really good at

46
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,280
physical is a really good at door bypass

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,479
tools like you can start from any one of

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,719
those points and this kind of learn as

49
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,600
you go that getting caught is a bad

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,579
thing you want to get caught right I

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,020
know it sounds like counterintuitive but

52
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,250
you want to get caught it's how you know

53
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,929
that the client is doing what they're

54
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,790
supposed to be doing

55
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,610
you know and if it's a multi year client

56
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,200
and they're getting

57
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,200
that our year-over-year then that's

58
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,730
great very money you're helping them and

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,910
they're getting more secure right Jason

60
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,100
Street famous social engineer he's big

61
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,010
on this concepts I think you should do

62
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,650
that you need to be we're technical

63
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,140
right not necessarily with the case but

64
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,280
it does help right okay you're a more

65
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,959
dynamic tester right if not only can you

66
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,940
get in the front door bypass the

67
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,080
receptionist gets where you're supposed

68
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,760
to go maybe the server room right and

69
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,890
also know how to then plug some type of

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,859
device into that get a connection back

71
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,140
to the butene back at the office or

72
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,820
wherever they are established commanding

73
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,470
control things like that right

74
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,730
understanding how that stuff works makes

75
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,090
you more dynamic it's gonna give you

76
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,090
more opportunities

77
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:06,880
the bigger the order or scarier at the

78
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:11,260
job I I know this also probably sounds

79
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,269
counterintuitive but I think I am more

80
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,019
scared to walk into like a small bank

81
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:19,299
branch I think it's gonna be harder that

82
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,790
I do like with like Angie giant like

83
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,170
back-office location with like three

84
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,850
four hundred employees on a massive

85
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,670
canvas right there's so many where entry

86
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:31,510
points there's so many different options

87
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:34,570
right to elude security like a massive

88
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,190
space than just like walking into one

89
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,120
from front door to a bank branch where

90
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,980
you're immediately gonna be staring

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,890
three tellers in the face and a manager

92
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:47,290
to this so okay you're sweet skills so

93
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,029
let's talk about things that you

94
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,519
probably are already good at and you

95
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,049
just don't realize that will help you

96
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,980
grow in social engineering or as you're

97
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:55,690
thinking about getting into social

98
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,268
engineering can you make people laugh

99
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,160
right it's immediately disarmed in a

100
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,040
situation that is getting a little bit

101
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,630
awkward right so thank you you might

102
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,700
have tipped somebody off or you may be

103
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,290
going down the wrong path or someone in

104
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,640
there you're starting to think like

105
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,070
maybe this isn't going well

106
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,170
can you crack a joke can you give you a

107
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,570
label in that way kind of tone down the

108
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,820
situation are you good at engaging

109
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,839
people in conversation like not even

110
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,769
when somebody starts with you I mean

111
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,089
like can you just start talking

112
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,830
something about something and keep it

113
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,810
going right if you good at that huge

114
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,260
skill and it's always something you can

115
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,150
work on

116
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,700
can you look more or less approachable

117
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,500
when you need to do you work well under

118
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,979
pressure that's a biggie if you're good

119
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,720
at that you're got flat hair I can you

120
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,880
appear confident when necessary in a

121
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,260
week when necessary right sometimes you

122
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,610
want to put somebody off sometimes you

123
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,750
want to look approachable like I mean

124
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,370
you just got to feel all that stuff out

125
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,190
it's sooner or later it'll come

126
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,900
naturally probably have some of these

127
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,469
skills I would consciously put them to

128
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,120
use yet I trust me they're all extremely

129
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,370
important and if you don't have them you

130
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,220
can always work on them so getting

131
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,630
started right regardless of your

132
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,650
experience so let's talk about some

133
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,440
things that are kind of broadly

134
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,520
applicable to everybody um you know

135
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,170
getting comfortable talking to people I

136
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,190
guess I'd smile at strangers strike up a

137
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:14,080
conversation in cafe all right now like

138
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,630
as things start to open up you can work

139
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,760
on these things I get outside of your

140
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,170
friend group right I mean it's easy to

141
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,210
talk to the people you know I mean

142
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,340
there's started learning anything there

143
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,130
so you know start interacting people you

144
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,229
don't know and you'll start to you know

145
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,210
understand like you know when you're not

146
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,160
expecting a certain comment or certain

147
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,729
question like how can you how can you

148
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,710
adapt

149
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,730
that's that scenario that conversation

150
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,349
with that person whether it's getting

151
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,610
weird or whether it's going creation

152
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,490
whatever you know it'll give you more

153
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,140
work whether on the field I try harmless

154
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,300
influence techniques because learn might

155
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,169
have everything's talking about Chris

156
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:53,590
boss used to be.we he'd FBI negotiator

157
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,030
for hostage crazies right he has a book

158
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,710
called never split the difference and he

159
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,630
talks about techniques like labeling

160
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,239
mirror and things like that so hearing

161
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:04,120
is like you know somebody says to you

162
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,560
all you know I'm sorry like I have a

163
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,170
really hard time getting this report in

164
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,670
to you by Friday you say something back

165
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,680
to them like how about hard time getting

166
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,330

from the mirror and to the labeling and

175
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,669

with an intranet community I know they

246
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,120
exist but most people are gonna be cool

247
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,650
especially if you work for Germany

248
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,150
doesn't have enough seating you the

249
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,350
champion right talk to your leadership

250
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,079

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,520
there's my any remain out there right

252
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,810
sell it in that way use some of your

253
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,480
influence techniques we talked about

254
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,760
earlier from some of the resources I'm

255
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,560
gonna list I create a proposal for

256
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,600
starting a small team right if there's

257
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,890
some interest offering perform an

258
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,240
assessment of your own company to show

259
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,800
you have some skills that you've been

260
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,770
working on the stuff even really not

261
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,530
right check on you know a clean desk

262
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,510
policy looking for passwords in the

263
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,790
office space checking the doors to see

264
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:36,220
how secure they are right stuff like

265
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,540
that fear let's talk about that so this

266
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,580
is the one thing else you overcome fear

267
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,430
and I always think about it for during

268
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,930
after the engagement I'm being paid to

269
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,030
play the bad guy right and if I don't do

270
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,219
it the old bad guy will do it for free

271
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:51,939
yeah that's the bad guy he'll do this

272
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,470
for free you know so we have to do it

273
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,420
well we have to be really good at it

274
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,920
right if you have to but to give it all

275
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,479
we have because you know we're providing

276
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,680
value to the client were helping them

277
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,960
get more secure more about fear remember

278
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,660
that unless you're a sociopath you will

279
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,980
never be feel asserting engagements I

280
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,569
mean I'm nervous before we send a lot of

281
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,780
them right it's inert it's like it's a

282
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:16,240
combination of like you know nerves I

283
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,589
think you're gonna fail your quote

284
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,420
unquote fail right they're gonna get

285
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,070
caught but getting contacted thing right

286
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,380
but you also want to be good you know

287
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,270
like you want to you want to get you as

288
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,830
a person if like personally you want to

289
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,870
get into that server room you want to

290
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,660
get fine I'm not tellin life you want to

291
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:36,250
you know for yourself show you know

292
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,360
figure you're capable good stuff you

293
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,180
know but it's actually don't want to

294
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,410
cripple you that's what you really don't

295
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,709
want is just you know having a panic

296
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,290
attack

297
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,780
or walk in the front door right not good

298
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,280
I hate mission calls personally I'll

299
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,170
just start out there I think they're

300
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,819
scarier than physical visits I don't

301
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,930
know why I've heard it from other people

302
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,950
too other people have that same fear

303
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,329
weird thing I don't know maybe because

304
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,650
you have more Alison you're in physical

305
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,140
setting whereas you're like have this

306
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,980
like you know what unidirectional thing

307
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,569
where you're talking somebody on the

308
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,070
phone and it's all about telling what

309
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,070
you say

310
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,050
I thought a physical indicator when you

311
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,560
go inside in the bathroom watch some

312
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:16,079
other talks maybe even in this this

313
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,369
conference or previous conferences I'll

314
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,740
have some links to some good talks at

315
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,900
the end you'd be sort of almost every

316
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,190
single one of them talks from the pros

317
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,020
talking about hiding in the bathroom

318
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,520
until they get the nerves down or until

319
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,380
they get ready after they get into that

320
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,329
fricking get past reception or like

321
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,020
through that you know initial access

322
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:36,090
point it's good me to calm your nerves

323
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,230
and again remember like in my previous

324
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,850
slide you're supposed to be there you're

325
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:44,460
being paid to do this right confidence

326
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:47,160
boosters help right and these will be

327
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:52,010
some necessities as you grow right badge

328
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:55,560
makers you know like corporate like a

329
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:57,120

movements from A to B to C physically

411

right you're not like sending certain

412
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,450
points a lot of pathway you want to go

413
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,490
to you right if you if you have that

414
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:53,040
television right here plan is to go to

the front door you're not gonna see when

416
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,599
the guy comes out the side door and

417
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,740
props it opened at a smoke break right

418
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,360
like you're not going to notice these

419
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,920
things because you're you're you're too

right planning into side doors don't

422
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,940
only bring gear for one pretext right

423
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,770
like what happens if you have a certain

424
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,260
pretext like as your foot has the

425
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,760
firewall tech but then you notice

426
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,230

again don't panic and do something out

431
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,160
of scope you really don't wanna do this

432
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,110
you're gonna get the client angry you

433
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,430
might be something illegal or outside

434
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,050
that's going to you know cause

435
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,209
disruptions to them right you don't want

436
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,520
to do that what you do want to do

437
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,740
passive an active recon so that you know

438
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,020

actively communicate ideas with your

444
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,220
points of contact right this is

445
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,380
collaborative unless it's like a super

446
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,190
like black box red team right but this

447
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,870

00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,090
your state you know sometimes lock picks

507
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,440
or other types of bypass devices you

508

can't bring them you can't have them

509
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,200
like in that state

510
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,449
that's literally against the law doesn't

511
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,820
matter what the clients nice saying safe

512
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,110
are you very clear on your scope right

513
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,760
if you spoke to the client do you know

514
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,020
exactly what you can and cannot do do

515
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,200
you know multiple copies of you get a

516
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,490
jail free letters okay how do you people

517
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,200
check to you have multiple points of

518
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,510
contact available during testing should

519
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,909
something go sideways are there security

520
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,110
guards are they armed right that changes

521
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:37,820
everything but you need to make sure

522
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,209
that you're doing that upfront make sure

523
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,860
you over stand if the building is

524
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,230
managed does the building management

525
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,459
know if they have no idea you're

526
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,720
supposed to be there and they catch you

527
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,070
they don't care what you get out of jail

528
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,480
free letter says they might not know the

529
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,720
people on it there's gonna call the cops

530
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,120
and if you're blown do not run

531
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,650
especially from the cops if you're

532
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,750
running from just a security guard I

533
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,110
mean now you're facing we plastered all

534
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,909
over

535
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,928
that's Kure booths if you try to come

536
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:04,549
back and get that guy that's not gonna

537
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:05,870
happen and if it's the cops you're

538
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,668
probably gonna get arrested if you're

539
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,139

I see people typing Thank You Omega I

571
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,780
appreciate it I was blowing through it

572
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:51,570
sorry if I went too fast ideas on how to

573
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:55,370
practice from Sean Sean ohh Sean ahh so

574
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:57,360
to practice honestly in the slides no

575
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,370
once you can actually get back outside

576
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,840
and go to cafes and stuff like practice

577
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,739
building rapport with people that you

578
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,480
don't know I'll happen those

579
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,310
conversations right like strike open

580
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,830
don't talk about string up a

581
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:10,050
conversation about someone's dog I see

582
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,699
where that leads right try to us you

583
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,680
know subtle influence techniques you

584
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,360
know to to build rapport people like I

585
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,030
was talking about Christmas labeling air

586
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,429
and things like that and honestly like

587
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,930
if you can't just you know get that job

588
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,730
and then immediately practice as like

589
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,290
okay you're the first day you're gonna

590
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,850
go try to get to this pack right it's

591
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,520
hard to get that hands-on practice with

592
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:32,760
operation law it's one of those things

593
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,590
just kind of like I said you know start

594
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,270
small work your way up I read those

595
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,760
books practice those with those tools

596
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,139
show the team that you're on that you're

597
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,700
getting there you're ready and then

598
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,460
sooner or later even give you that first

599
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,290
that first chance right and if any but I

600
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,060
do they'll have feedback for you and I

601
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,040
can cut them don't fly rate I mean you

602
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,210
can't like I said can't just walk into a

603
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,000
bank and try to get behind the teller

604
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:57,240
line though no company much you know

605
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:03,410
engagement whining response I mean just

606
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:06,330
jump right Thank You best I'm very talk

607
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,140
close call you learn a lesson you can

608
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,860
share

609
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:14,280
all right I had a close call a few

610
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:18,340
months ago where I was in a branch

611
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,440
Burbank small branch I walked in the

612
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,000
door the managers Kevin and sniper eyes

613
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,970

614
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,350
and she starts getting agitated she said

615
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,760
were you here to see Puma and I can tell

616
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,770
and she's like already like she's been

617
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,870
tipped off by somebody else already told

618
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,960
her who I was she wasn't having any of

619
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,668
it and you know I said you know okay let

620
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,840
me check you know with my contacts you

621
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:39,039
know there's something something right

622
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,418
now right here you know I know I'm

623
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,640
supposed to be here but you all get back

624
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:45,190
to you I walk up the door I get called

625
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,350
by their manager or her manager back

626
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,970
into the back office and he's like where

627
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,439
are you I told him I'm like when the

628
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:55,390
partner she's like well she's about to

629
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,740
call the cops or that was one of the

630
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,110
closest calls I've had I don't have any

631
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,280
of these like crazy stories like some of

632
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,889
these guys do again I've only been doing

633
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,908
this for a couple years but that's one

634
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:13,030
that comes to mind that was a little

635
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:14,559
scary see here a lot of Wow the other

636
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,870
guys one of the typical goals you have

637
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,090
during physical time fast like the

638
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,320
archer so that's all engage of

639
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,879
dependence and it depends on what the

640
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,820
client wants right

641
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,140
some of them will say you know get in

642
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,240
the front door or try to get into the

643
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,549
server room right get access to that and

644
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,400
then stop there right or maybe they'll

645
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:33,700
say get in there and then I won't break

646
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,200
anything

647
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,490
do whatever you want we want to see how

648
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,169
far you can take this can you plug

649
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,970
something into our server rack and get a

650
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:41,980
connection back to like command and

651
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,840
control infrastructure right that'll be

652
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,610
something they want and they might say

653
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,030
okay now what can you do right so it's

654
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:51,760
all client stealing documents right

655
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:54,389
getting access to disaster recovery
