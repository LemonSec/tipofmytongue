1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,270
okay sounds good all right so today is a

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,039
very interesting session at least to me

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,250
something that I'm really fascinated

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,169
with and that is deep fakes fun and

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,929
exciting stuff in the deep fake world

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,039
going on and you know it blows my mind

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,180
the way that we've really just

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,160
accelerated in how digital image

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,800
manipulation has taken place over the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,109
last you know five ten years it just

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,760
blows my mind now I have a little

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,679
photography background that's kind of

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,989
where I come into this it's actually

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,629
what got me into computers back in the

15
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,000
day I worked for the US Navy I was an

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,770
avionics tech used to fix radar jammers

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,590
one of the guys on the ship I was on

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,079
which was the USS America he had one of

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,660
these things called an amiga 500 and it

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,920
was just the coolest thing I'd ever seen

21
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,110
he had a little hand scanner he could

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,430
scan images and digitally manipulate

23
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,859
them that got me fascinated with digital

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,750
imaging and so I went from doing film

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,320
photography to getting into the digital

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,810
side and what we've seen lately kind of

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,048
rides along with that and marries that

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,610
in my infoset career which is

29
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:13,530
fascinating to me so that's really what

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,150
you know one of the reasons I want to

31
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,880
talk about this today and one of the

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,790
reasons I really like this session so a

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,140
little bit about me yes I'm old you can

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,689
tell by the gray hair somehow or another

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,220
I've grown like this I don't know a gray

36
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,929
thing on the side of my nose here during

37
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,700
Coe but I don't know what that's all

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,680
about but I'm starting to get a little

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,150
bit long in the tooth but you know I've

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,900
been in this industry since gosh the

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,689
1990s around 1995 is really when I got

42
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,530
into IT insecurity I've worked in

43
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,779
healthcare I've worked in medical I've

44
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,939
worked for the Department of Defense I

45
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,619
was a contractor with the US Army for

46
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,559
about ten years where eventually I was

47
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,810
the security manager for the second

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,240
regional cyber center western hemisphere

49
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,009
which is a really impressive name of an

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,229
organization until you have to say that

51
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,320
every time you answer the phone also if

52
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,969
any of you are CIS espies I was the

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,399
director of member relations and

54
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,470
services for a couple of years try not

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,360
to throw fruit tomatoes whatever at me

56
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,980
if you had a bad experience I'm sorry I

57
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,660
did try

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,040
but enough about me I mean like I said

59
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,410
I've been doing this for a long time

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,209
very interesting to me to see where

61
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,160
we're going on this digital side of

62
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,420
things I do work for know before were

63
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,570
one of the sponsors of the conference

64
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,260
here yes I was accepted to do this talk

65
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:34,470
before we ever sponsored so I do a lot

66
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,450
of talks though what we do it at know

67
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,310
before is we do a security awareness

68
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,230
training and simulated phishing platform

69
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,780
we're all about the human element which

70
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,880
is where this really ties into things it

71
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,770
fascinates me to see how humans react to

72
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,950
things and this just kind of you know

73
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,830
goes along with that so a bit of the

74
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,720
agenda today how this all got started

75
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,060
how this talk got started the

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,120
progression of digital fakes potential

77
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,610
impact detection and defending against

78
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,470
the fakery and silliness so let's start

79
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,240
off with how this got started I really

80
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,040
got started with this one of my

81
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,080
colleagues is Javad Malik he's over in

82
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,100
the UK if you've seen the CI double SP

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,560
videos or let's see accepted the risk

84
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,530
things like that a great guy very smart

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,350
was with four or five one research for a

86
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,390
while him and I we've been friends for a

87
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,850
while and so we started chatting back

88
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,540
and forth on whatsapp and we started

89
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,730
really kind of cranking up the level of

90
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,320
how we harassed each other and at one

91
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,600
point then we started switching over to

92
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,370
doing screen captures and then modifying

93
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,200
it and even like paint or you know

94
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,580
whatever and then putting it back I

95
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,560
can't believe you said this right and we

96
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,440
started like messing with each other

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,640
pretty bad in this and eventually we

98
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,960
reached the point of mutually assured

99
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,019
destruction with respect to HR and we

100
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,120
realized you know this kind of stuff is

101
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,570
actually fairly topical because you can

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,790
really really mess up somebody's life if

103
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,859
you make things like this that are

104
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,170
believable and unfortunately there's a

105
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,270
lot of tools out there already and a lot

106
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,660
of things going on that are

107
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,450
misinformation disinformation and

108
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,738
causing problems like that but you know

109
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,510
back in my younger years the stupid

110
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,060
things I did and said aren't on the

111
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,550
internet forever nowadays though if you

112
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,650
post things up even if it's not true a

113
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,710
lot of times that person then has to

114
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,469
fight out of it right and social media

115
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,870
has really increased the voice of the

116
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,169
individual but it's also increased the

117
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,669
voice of the bots and the the bad actors

118
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,620
a lot of times who are actually in

119
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:41,780
theirs just to see the world burn right

120
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,639
we've seen a lot of that go on from the

121
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,229
beginning of the Cova thing to what

122
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,599
we're seeing right now it's George Floyd

123
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:50,180
I'm not saying everybody's bad but we do

124
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:53,560
know that a lot of the social media

125
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,680
accounts are being run by bots trolls or

126
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,900
someone you know along that lines not

127
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,240
necessarily humans or not necessarily

128
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,919
humans that are themselves and

129
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,770
individuals right I think one of the

130
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,710
studies I just saw said 52% of the

131
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,840
recent stuff having to do with George

132
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,979
Floyd and police brutality was actually

133
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,219
done by BOTS or trolls on the Internet I

134
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:21,909
mean it's it's mind-boggling but with

135
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,070
this technology that we're seeing here

136
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:27,740
this has a potential to really impact

137
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,300
people also you know with respect to

138
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,949
scams and stuff like that I'm gonna talk

139
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,009
about how this can have impact on that

140
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:36,639
as well but it's it's fascinating

141
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:39,259
technology it's very useful technology

142
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,699
but it's also very dangerous technology

143
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,560
and stuff that we do have to start

144
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:44,810
really watching for and I don't think a

145
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,550
lot of people are so the next part

146
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,039
progression of digital face well I did

147
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,630
steal this from Javad we had put

148
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,479
together this to kind of work together

149
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,639
but Javad showing his researcher side

150
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,800
here with a 4-5-1 research side and

151
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,300
basically what he's doing what we're

152
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,509
doing here is we're breaking it down

153
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,460
into some quadrants with deep fakes

154
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:06,560
being down on the bottom shallow being

155
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,810
on the top text manipulation simple

156
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,789
photo editing Photoshop right and then

157
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,620
you get in moving over are still in the

158
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,900
top top side but moving to the right

159
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,219
green screen stuff where you're faking

160
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,770
the backgrounds right everyone's doing

161
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:21,320
that unzoom these days okay but that is

162
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,789
a digital image manipulation right Josie

163
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,740
on an island in the middle of somewhere

164
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:27,620
whatever then you got the the JibJab

165
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,090
style which is always funny to be still

166
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,949
around the holidays where you know you

167
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,698
put a friend's head on an elf the dances

168
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:36,229
around that's not super high end stuff

169
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,479
though right but when you start getting

170
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,550
into the deep fakery stuff that's when

171
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,849
you start leveraging the AI or neural

172
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,399
net

173
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:45,679
works and some of this you know this

174
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:49,550
machine learning pieces and that

175
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:50,958
includes D clothing generating people

176
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,179
that don't even exist how many of you

177
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,289
seen the pictures of things that AI has

178
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:59,839
generated people and faces and some of

179
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,969
them are just horrific right but some of

180
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,279
them look absolutely amazing and that

181
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:07,039
person never even existed but based on

182
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,749
the picture the AI created it's really

183
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,159
hard to tell that and then you get into

184
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:12,979
the face swap and then you get into the

185
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:16,998
puppetry on the really dynamic stuff now

186
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:18,979
image manipulation starts out in in

187
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,779
different kinds of ways right

188
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:22,639
we're going to talk about removing

189
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:24,110
people from busy locations this is an

190
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,659
imaging stacking things tilt shift

191
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:30,379
photos these are different ways to make

192
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:32,449
things look like they should be correct

193
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:36,409
but they're not okay so force

194
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:38,599
perspective etc etc so let's start with

195
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:40,789
the image stacking here this is

196
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,009
something I saw years back in Photoshop

197
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:44,330
used to be a very manual process but

198
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,969
essentially what you do is you take like

199
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,990
a camera set it up in a place and over

200
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:53,149
time you take a whole bunch of pictures

201
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,490
from the same spot with people moving

202
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:57,229
around and then what you do is you take

203
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,300
all of these pictures you stack them on

204
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,969
top of each other and then you start

205
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,559
removing people through layers so before

206
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:05,509
you know it you have an empty spot

207
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:07,759
because you took a picture when there

208
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:09,740
wasn't somebody occupying that space and

209
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,879
this works with shadows this works with

210
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,369
everything and what's happened these

211
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,050
days is scripts are actually being

212
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:17,569
included in Photoshop now that just do

213
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,349
it for you it's super easy to do these

214
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:23,029
days so essentially you can change

215
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,769
what's going on there well the other

216
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,499
thing you can do is is you can put

217
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:29,149
people in pictures you know but you can

218
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:31,189
take somebody out of a picture if you

219
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,559
really want to or make it look like

220
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:36,349
something was completely empty when in

221
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,000
fact it wasn't it's a pretty interesting

222
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,399
way to do this if you're ever doing you

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,729
know you're doing those pictures when

224
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,199
you're being a tourist you know in DC

225
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:48,110
very rarely will you find one of those

226
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:49,849
areas there that is empty at any given

227
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,260
time so this is a great trick if you do

228
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,819
want to get a picture of you know the

229
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,620
Lincoln Memorial or something like that

230
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:56,660
this is what this

231
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,810
his stuff really excels at but you can

232
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,449
use it for other types of manipulation

233
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,099
as well now tilt shift images is

234
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,470
something that's come out recently this

235
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,440
is taking something real and making it

236
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:13,130
look very fake so this is a picture here

237
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,800
this is actually a real town and what

238
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:20,000
they did this is a shot from a drone got

239
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,469
this from DG Eyes website here but this

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,480
is a shot from a drone and these work

241
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,120
really well if you go up and shoot down

242
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,839
at about 45 degrees and then what you do

243
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,120
is you you insert a blur on the top and

244
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,430
the bottom piece so you get one strip

245
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,400
that's actually in focus and then you

246
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,949
really boost the saturation up so this

247
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,110
can make things look you know very very

248
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,700
fake this is another way to do some

249
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,740
image manipulation if you want to make

250
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,360
things look fake but it's if you think

251
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,640
about this just different ways that you

252
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,550
can use these techniques to either

253
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,430
discredit something or you know add

254
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,189
credit to things as well now the most

255
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:01,130
common one I see all the time is force

256
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,440
perspective this is using angles and

257
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,920
perspectives to make things look unreal

258
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,050
or sometimes even real so these are port

259
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,089
force perspective you can see the dog on

260
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,640
the right is really not about nine feet

261
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,020
tall but it's closer to the camera than

262
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,880
the people in the background same with

263
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,470
the guy getting you know the bucket over

264
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,120
his head and we've all seen the people

265
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,490
holding up the Leaning Tower of Pisa

266
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,880
things like this right this is how you

267
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:29,810
can exaggerate the size of an item or an

268
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,339
animal now there's other ways to to deal

269
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,229
with this as well and this is some stuff

270
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:37,250
I've been seeing actually in some media

271
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,900
shots lately if you want to make things

272
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,480
look differently when you're doing

273
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,310
photographs you can change what you do

274
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,910
through the use of telephoto lenses and

275
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,750
things like that

276
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,370
for example Kovan 19 all kinds of stuff

277
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,410
going around about social distancing

278
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,570
right and so a hot topic for some people

279
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,459
not a hot topic for other people but for

280
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,589
those that it's a hot topic for they get

281
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,869
riled up when they see crowds well if

282
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,540
you take a camera and you take a long

283
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,670
telephoto lens you stand in front of the

284
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,400
people that are stacked kind of at a

285
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,300
distance okay a way directly away from

286
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,949
you

287
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,479
when you take that photo using the

288
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,980
telephoto lens it can make them look

289
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,930
like they're right next to each other

290
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,360
but then you swing around and they're

291
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,920
actually six eight feet apart it just

292
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,290
depends on how you do that so you can

293
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,089
actually modify what you want to tell in

294
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,030
a story and I've seen actually some

295
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:28,760
media stories where that happened and

296
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,709
and they showed how the difference from

297
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,140
the different perspectives were done in

298
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,690
order to change what it is the story

299
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,250
that they wanted to produce for the

300
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,170
person they're now this is not a

301
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,940
political dig this is not on one side or

302
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,560
another I'm not saying it either way I'm

303
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:47,210
saying these are techniques that are

304
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,829
used consistently to reinforce what it

305
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,390
is we want to show and they're just

306
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,810
different tips and tricks that you use

307
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:56,750
with cameras and with angles and

308
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,939
perspective in particular now moving

309
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,620
forward getting out of this simple basic

310
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,740
stuff here we've started seeing these

311
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,390
face swap apps right in these filters

312
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,640
adding cat ears in real time how many

313
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,740
were you remember that I mean we should

314
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,710
all remember this one at this point but

315
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,030
the app that aged you by 20 or 30 years

316
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,500
and there was all the hubbub about

317
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,209
sending information to the Russians

318
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,430
public level anyways

319
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,860
imagine that that stuff is happening in

320
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,930
our phones and that's the mind boggling

321
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,010
pieces through the use of our phones and

322
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,589
some of the stuff is being done on the

323
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,420
back end etc etc but we've got a lot of

324
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,950
power in our hands to be able to do this

325
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,500
and if you saw those aged ones men some

326
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,900
of those looked really really stinking

327
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,910
real right and face swapping apps

328
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,490
Instagram all that man my wife gets

329
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,790
ahold of the filter sometimes and it's

330
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,140
just oh I'm not a big one for those

331
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,060
sorts of things you know the Facebook

332
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,640
filters and but they just love it and

333
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,469
then how about making animals talk we've

334
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,449
seen that sort of thing as well this is

335
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,240
all being done in in real time or near

336
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,900
real time or very short time just on our

337
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,690
phones now where can this go wrong how

338
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,540
many of you all saw this this was a

339
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:08,960
Pakistani minute or ministers live press

340
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:12,469
conference he was giving and the person

341
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,720
who is actually streaming it had

342
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,830
forgotten they had a cat filter on it

343
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,760
right kind of awkward a little weird

344
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,640
right

345
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,250
but it

346
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,890
amazing how powerful this technology is

347
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,660
that we have in our phone right what if

348
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:33,189
they wanted to do other things rather

349
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:34,959
than cat ears okay you know it's just

350
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,050
kind of an odd thing I'm assuming this

351
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,690
person felt pretty bad about what

352
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,160
happened one way or another but it did

353
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,770
make me laugh pretty good when we saw

354
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,290
this there's another one here

355
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,949
my talking pet now this one's

356
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,689
interesting

357
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,180
you can put words in your pets mouth

358
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:58,480
right who doesn't want to have their cat

359
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:59,530
talk okay yeah gotcha it's not new tech

360
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,070
this has been around for a while

361
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,050
actually

362
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,550
am I talking pet what's interesting

363
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,069
about this if you want to check it out

364
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,719
there's a video that I link to down

365
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,610
there I know you can't click it but you

366
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,020
know I'll be here for a second but

367
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,660
what's interesting about this is when

368
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,689
they have the pet talking it's more than

369
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,630
just moving a fake mouth it's also doing

370
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:22,810
eye twitches or ear movements or the

371
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:26,680
other subtle things that make it look a

372
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:29,650
lot more realistic and again this is

373
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,930
happening through phones it's it's a

374
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,170
very interesting process but the

375
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:37,000
manipulation that's happening with that

376
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,829
is pretty fascinating actually and it's

377
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,770
it's fairly well done I mean it's not

378
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,630
going to convince anyone but it does

379
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,280
definitely draw into that wow this is

380
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,040
actually pretty well done because of the

381
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,600
other movements that happen now we're

382
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,930
gonna get into some of the uglier stuff

383
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,530
this is the video deep fake apps okay

384
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,849
there's several of them out there

385
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:01,870
downloadable for github these are free

386
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:04,900
they generally use a GPU and put quite a

387
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:08,500
hurting on GPUs when they're doing this

388
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:12,250
processing and video cards seem to work

389
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,180
better than the the radians they're more

390
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:20,260
supported and what this basically does

391
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:21,790
in most cases it takes a video and we

392
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,550
all know videos are put together at a

393
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,199
frame rate of 29.97 you know frames per

394
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,660
second here in the US or about 30 frames

395
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,000
per second and it basically breaks that

396
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,100
down into all the individual frames and

397
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,410
then using a I typically tensorflow

398
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,230
back-end what they're doing

399
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,779
they're looking for faces in every

400
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:44,949
single one of these and they pull out

401
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:48,339
the face usually a 128 by 128 pixels

402
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:51,519
square or that can be changed a little

403
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:53,800
bit but most common is 128 by 128 but it

404
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,490
will pull the pictures those faces out

405
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,290
of every single one of those frames and

406
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:02,470
then what its gonna end up doing is

407
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:05,860
gonna kind of replace that build a model

408
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,629
on it and put it back together now the

409
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,060
one I've been playing with the most is a

410
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:12,160
deep face lab mm-hmm this is where you

411
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,619
can get it from it's free windows

412
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,750
binaries are downloadable it's easy to

413
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,509
do he uses tensorflow as the backend

414
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,449
like I said but the package is is is all

415
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:25,660
there right I actually did some stuff on

416
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:28,449
my laptop I have a gaming laptop it's

417
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,759
kinda like a I think it's a 1080 Nvidia

418
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:33,459
card in it and did pretty well now

419
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,259
they're not super fast we're not having

420
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,930
we're not seeing this in real time at

421
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:39,430
this point and it does take a while but

422
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,388
it's pretty amazing what you can do in

423
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,888
about 12 hours I can produce a

424
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,240
reasonable looking video I was going to

425
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,689
show it here but I don't think it would

426
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,399
stream very well some of the key things

427
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:53,680
you're looking for here though is a

428
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,509
general basic facial structure and

429
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,969
whether or not they match the closer it

430
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:59,800
is the easier it is but what it does is

431
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,139
again it's going to look at your source

432
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,178
like where you're pulling it from so you

433
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,439
have some video clips of the source it's

434
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,480
going to look at the destination where

435
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,640
you're putting it to its gonna identify

436
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,289
the faces and those and then it's

437
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,839
actually going to build like a model of

438
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:16,270
those two so what happens is when you

439
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,760
put it back together you end up with the

440
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,619
eye blinks you end up with a lot of

441
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,289
these various things because it put it

442
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,000
together now in the meantime I'll show

443
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:28,569
you here this is what I was playing

444
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,440
around with with with Javad and and Tom

445
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:34,149
Langford here this was from lost all the

446
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,010
money I think one of their most recent

447
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,650
videos which is an awesome money about

448
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,510
CEO fraud I love it it's hilarious check

449
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,820
it out if you haven't already lost all

450
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,440
the money it's got a catchy tune too but

451
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,299
you can see here where it's pulled out

452
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,890
all of these different faces from there

453
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,299
and then of course wherever you're going

454
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,759
to put it on to

455
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:54,519
you're going to end up taking that and

456
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,619
you know basically it's going to do the

457
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,080
same thing on that side and then what

458
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:00,789
you do is on the on the input type like

459
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,549
this you remove all of the ones you

460
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:06,999
don't want replaced and it does a pretty

461
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:09,039
good job it really really does the the

462
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:10,600
video I really wish I could show it if

463
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,169
you hit me up on Twitter I think maybe

464
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,539
I'll make a link to it but it's amazing

465
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:18,999
what you can do in just a few hours on a

466
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:22,359
laptop these days

467
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:24,869
now on the other side of this one of the

468
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,009
drawbacks of doing deep fake videos is

469
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:29,738
generally speaking if you're gonna use

470
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:32,619
it for an attack vector it's not going

471
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:34,720
to do voice so you need a voice actor to

472
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:36,939
replace the voice on that or another

473
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,249
audio clip that's gonna do it now these

474
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,470
deep fake audio apps are getting more

475
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:43,779
and more popular as well

476
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,269
I've been following one recently now

477
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:48,220
these again github most of the time uses

478
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:51,369
the same tensorflow back-end of the GPU

479
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:55,090
to do things this time it uses audio

480
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:57,369
clips to replace the voice this one is

481
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:01,029
called real-time voice cloning it's on

482
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:02,439
github there Python tool uses some pre

483
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:05,279
trained models to help out which is

484
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,139
night it's not great but here's the deal

485
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:11,159
I'm actually following this one and not

486
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:13,959
a day goes by that I'm not seeing people

487
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:17,049
interacting with this asking questions

488
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:23,200
making changes it's very very active in

489
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:25,658
how it's being used and improved you can

490
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,669
still hear the differences but it's

491
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:29,529
gotten a whole lot better and it is near

492
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,799
real-time when you're doing the voice

493
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:34,509
cloning pretty fascinating to check out

494
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,918
some of these things but you start

495
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:38,950
putting these things together start

496
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,269
using this and you know it can get

497
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,299
pretty ugly and I'll talk about that

498
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:45,940
here so potential impact of fakes mm-hmm

499
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:48,820
so this is where we get into what are we

500
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,919
doing with these things what can be done

501
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,189
with these why does it matter and why

502
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:57,399
should I pay attention well first of all

503
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,480
it's an info SEC conference okay and it

504
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:01,479
wouldn't be a good info SEC conference

505
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,700
if I didn't show some sort of a Sun Zoo

506
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,480
slide okay

507
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:09,090
all warfare is based on deception yes

508
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,890
we've all seen this quote it is a very

509
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,370
true quote and if you don't think we're

510
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:16,290
dealing with warfare these days we can

511
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,020
definitely chat about that piece of it

512
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,790
because a lot of what we see a lot of

513
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,450
what I see you know through know before

514
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:25,680
through through the areas that I'm at

515
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,940
we're seeing not the kids in the

516
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,510
basement drinking Mountain Dew eating

517
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,030
pizza

518
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,830
those aren't the ones doing the bulk of

519
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,300
these kinds of attacks we're actually

520
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,850
seeing organized crime pretty

521
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,680
significant organized crime going on

522
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:41,610
with this we're seeing nation-states

523
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:44,730
taking part of this if you look at you

524
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,139
know I mentioned earlier some of the the

525
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,180
bots that we're going on one of the

526
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,190
carnegie-mellon I think it was studies

527
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,350
showed that almost half of the

528
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,900
coronavirus tweets that were going out

529
00:20:52,350 --> 00:21:00,300
there at the time were from bots okay

530
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,430
and they were following the Russian and

531
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,129
Chinese playbook very very closely

532
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:08,970
it's about dividing it's about causing

533
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,950
division within a a group of people or a

534
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,630
nation this is the kind of stuff that

535
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,540
really honestly is going on I know it

536
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,880
sounds super liked in tinfoil Hattie but

537
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,500
this is really going on and so we have

538
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,720
to take this stuff seriously because it

539
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,730
does have real-world impacts this is not

540
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,220
one or two guys trying to scam somebody

541
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:30,060
out of some money they're actually

542
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:32,330
pretty significant attacks and honestly

543
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:35,129
they're the really stinking good Adam

544
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:40,020
hmm so we talk about business email

545
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:43,170
compromised right you know CEO frauds a

546
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,150
big deal we see this more and more this

547
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,510
is the kind of deception stuff that we

548
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,040
get there's usually not a payload we got

549
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,290
emails here but sometimes you can get

550
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,350
phone calls that confirm the emails and

551
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,540
if you can change that voice right away

552
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,949
you know that's that's a problem so we

553
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,530
see a lot of this kind of stuff in the

554
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,260
deception in fishing in smishing and

555
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,790
phishing especially a lot of deception

556
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,830
how many of you are watching some of

557
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,810
these other things here right and seeing

558
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,639
how phishing is being used as social

559
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,649
engineering skills over the phone are

560
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,880
phenomenal right if you saw a leathe or

561
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,500
any of the others to talk about stuff

562
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,840
it's amazing what you can do

563
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,640
with just a phone call this is the kind

564
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,610
of attacks we're seeing now we got to

565
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,580
understand when it comes to deception

566
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,659
our brains are amazing amazing things if

567
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,790
you ever want to see some really cool

568
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,580
stuff check out the series called brain

569
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,990
games I don't know if it's on Hulu or

570
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,659
one of those I don't remember where it's

571
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,550
streaming now but it is fascinating some

572
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,460
of the stuff that we kind of think we

573
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:43,440
know about our brains but really don't I

574
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,330
absolutely love the series because I

575
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,520
love to learn about human behavior and

576
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,250
and kind of the vulnerabilities that we

577
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,650
all have well one of the things our

578
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:56,130
brains job is to filter interpret and

579
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:59,220
present reality sounds kind of deep

580
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:03,420
right we assume that what we smell what

581
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:05,130
we hear what we taste what we feel all

582
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,320
of these things are absolutely real

583
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,690
that's reality right but what we got to

584
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,090
understand is our brain actually filters

585
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:15,060
the inputs that we receive you're

586
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,709
getting sensory inputs all day long some

587
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,990
things are being ignored certain smells

588
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,520
that you don't smell right there's the

589
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,470
old joke about you know the cat litter

590
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,139
box right there was that whole series of

591
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,150
commercials on that where your nose is

592
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,700
dead to the cat smell well this is your

593
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,860
brain blocking things out but it also

594
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,930
does some other amazing things if you're

595
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,490
you know if you look left or right with

596
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,050
your eyes right now how many of you see

597
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,660
your nose when you're not thinking about

598
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,460
it well most of us don't right because

599
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,610
our our brain is actually filtering out

600
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,710
that portion of our vision and replacing

601
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:49,949
it with the other image on the other

602
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:53,640
side it's amazing what our brains do but

603
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:56,160
these can be tricked these inputs can be

604
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,200
purr can be tricked oftentimes through

605
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,350
emotions that's one of the most powerful

606
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,770
ways to trick your brain is through

607
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:07,439
emotions we see these kind of things

608
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:12,450
just all the time in the attack vectors

609
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:15,120
that we have here so let's see when

610
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,420
we're talking about attack vectors you

611
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,669
know talking about video or photo face

612
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:24,480
how can these be used well how many of

613
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:26,400
you know about romance camps how many of

614
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,820
you know somebody that's been caught up

615
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,390
in romance scams I'm on the advisory

616
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,389
board

617
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,900
for a group called cybercrime support

618
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,440
network

619
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,480
they run fraud support org and this is a

620
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,520
website where people can go if they're

621
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,760
victims of cybercrime and actually go

622
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,180
there and get kind of directed in the

623
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,950
right places to report it correctly what

624
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,320
are the next steps who do I talk to to

625
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,390
get my money back it's a fantastic

626
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,800
organization but one of the top things

627
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:00,150
they see is romance scams so what

628
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,350
happens you know when we talk to

629
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,520
somebody if you've ever talked to

630
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,620
somebody that's been involved in a

631
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,510
romance scam oftentimes what we will

632
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:11,879
tell them is you know get them to do

633
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,620
something and send you a picture or a

634
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,980
video of them doing something right

635
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,790
drink a cup of tea with your pinky out

636
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,160
something like that

637
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:22,649
well that often times will kind of blow

638
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,860
the whole charade right there for those

639
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:27,060
that are really emotionally invested

640
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,219
sometimes they'll believe whatever cover

641
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,110
story the the attackers will give and it

642
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,470
continues on but that's a quick way to

643
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:37,139
dispel what's going on but now using

644
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:39,210
some of these apps using some of these

645
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,570
different tools that we've talked about

646
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,430
here they can actually create videos

647
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,220
that makes it look like them now

648
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:50,400
understand a lot of romance scams they

649
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,970
come about and they use personas of

650
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,100
people that are or photos at least of

651
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,410
people that are influential

652
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,120
they look like doctors sometimes

653
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,800
celebrities right

654
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,850
Jonnie fell in love with me you know

655
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,580
that's that's a great one for the

656
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,169
elderly folks they'll use that well

657
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,120
there's materials out there that we can

658
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,530
get from a lot of these people speaking

659
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,959
at conferences speaking of movies

660
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,210
whatever and use that to create that

661
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,770
well now imagine if we tell somebody hey

662
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,540
you know have them send you a picture of

663
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,570
them drinking tea with their pinky out

664
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:24,240
and they now replace the celebrity's

665
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:27,320
face on that as they record it right

666
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,340
these things can lead to actually

667
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,639
getting rid of some of the steps that we

668
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,590
take to offset some of the significant

669
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,610
scams that are going on right

670
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,020
what about outrage man yeah if you

671
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,939
haven't looked at the news lately there

672
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,310
is a hell of a lot of outrage going on

673
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,520
out there and rightfully so

674
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:49,500
but outrage is an emotion that drives

675
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,350
human action it's one of the most

676
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:56,220
powerful emotions to drive human action

677
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:58,169
that and anger so clickbait is something

678
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,090
we see and we see it a lot of times in

679
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:06,390
you know the the regular ads well

680
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:08,370
imagine this you're whomever you want to

681
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,320
take somebody a celebrity politician

682
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:13,320
whatever and you end up putting one of

683
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,010
these videos together that makes it look

684
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,649
like they did something completely

685
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:22,290
outrageous okay and then they say they

686
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:24,510
put that together with if you you know

687
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,909
if you can't believe this let's get them

688
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,730
you know thrown out go sign this

689
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,620
petition so you send them to a place

690
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,870
where now you know of course you've got

691
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,669
to verify who you are you know everyone

692
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,879
expects that so we need your name

693
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:41,070
address social security number the name

694
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,960
of your first pet mom's maiden name

695
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,659
right all this kind of stuff well the

696
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,120
people are so amped up they got the the

697
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,980
the endorphins are flowing through their

698
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,879
head they're upset they're angry they

699
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,620
don't apply common sense and that's

700
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,290
where people can be tricked into doing

701
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,090
that it's a great place for the bad guys

702
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,280
to be able to leverage this outrage

703
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:05,580
clickbait and that leads into the

704
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,990
election influencing right so we've got

705
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,449
an election coming up in November

706
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:14,490
if we survive 2020 we have an election

707
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:18,000
coming up when when this happens what

708
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:21,060
would keep these you know 50% of troll

709
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
accounts from taking a well done deep

710
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:27,240
fake and launching something absolutely

711
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,520
outrageous out there on either side I'm

712
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,280
not this is not a political thing it is

713
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,410
an either side sort of thing but what if

714
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,720
they do that right before the election

715
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,060
and people are so angry and outraged

716
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,710
when they go to vote even though

717
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:45,300
eventually it's going to be proven fake

718
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:48,300
by that time the vote has already cast

719
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:51,090
so elections can be influenced through

720
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,399
this local elections could be influenced

721
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,100
through this there is a lot of power and

722
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,270
what's going on using some of these deep

723
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,909
fakes

724
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,950
also imagine if you're somebody whose

725
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:04,200
job you know there for a long time

726
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,580
Disney was really selective about what

727
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,110
it is their people did and when

728
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,139
something bad came up in the background

729
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:12,750
they had a you know they could get can

730
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,480
right but there are a lot of jobs in

731
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:18,510
public facing sorts of situations where

732
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,580
reputation is key well what if you start

733
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,550
applying some of these things with

734
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,590
weaponized photos or videos this is one

735
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:27,600
right here these are kind of interesting

736
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,090
by placing the bubbles and certain

737
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,310
things it makes your mind draw some

738
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,020
conclusions right this is just another

739
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,169
way that our brains filter into things

740
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:40,350
if we were to able to you know do this

741
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:43,170
and show things in selective ways there

742
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,689
is a chance that you could impact

743
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,910
somebody's life and the bad thing about

744
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,030
today is these things stay out there for

745
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:52,500
a very very long time it's not just like

746
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,629
you know your circle of friends it gets

747
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,760
forgotten about employers go to do

748
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:59,850
searches later on these could impact you

749
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:03,000
for a very very long time now on the

750
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,490
audio fake side same sort of thing

751
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,970
romance scams you know you have the

752
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:11,310
voice of yani professing love to Grandma

753
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,020
whoever in the in the nursing home she

754
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,570
believes him and is gonna send money so

755
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,210
that you can come visit her right it

756
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,460
just adds to that election influencing

757
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,100
again what about a fake phone call

758
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,510
intercepted and they're taking these and

759
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,399
in turning around and using that as a

760
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,020
weaponized attack that is something we

761
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,180
have to watch for we have to be careful

762
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,580
for and then you know CEO fraud or other

763
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,770
types of business email compromised oh I

764
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,389
got an email says I need to transfer a

765
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,760
whole bunch of money and then the CEO

766
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,310
called me and said you better do that

767
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,420
well now the person is doing that

768
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,850
because they've let their guard down

769
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,650
they have two points of verification not

770
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,850
that they called the CEO but the CEO

771
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:53,970
calls them or the quote-unquote CEO now

772
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:59,580
this was something that they've alluded

773
00:30:53,970 --> 00:31:03,780
to in this particular deal here I think

774
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:05,250
this is rather interesting what's

775
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:10,500
happening here

776
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:10,980
they say that a deep fake was used to

777
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,049
mimic

778
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:19,370
voice of a CEO in a wire transfer thing

779
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:21,389
there's been no evidence to that but

780
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:24,178
there are people that did absolutely

781
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,980
believe it I can tell you right now with

782
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:28,980
the different technologies that I've

783
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,770
listened to and seen and play it's not

784
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,900
really something I think that it's very

785
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:38,129
likely because you can definitely still

786
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:40,049
tell the difference however it is

787
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,500
something that I think is going to be

788
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:45,210
changing in the next couple of years to

789
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,440
where we're gonna have to watch that

790
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:52,530
sort of thing in this case again they

791
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,120
they stated that it was the CEO and

792
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,290
they're just sure that it was a CEO it

793
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,600
could have actually been somebody with a

794
00:31:55,290 --> 00:32:01,740
very similar voice to the CEO that

795
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,540
actually did kind of copy that name and

796
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,260
that's the problem

797
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,690
executives a lot of times especially

798
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,000
depending on the organization they do

799
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,760
talks they do these sorts of things that

800
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,630
have them out there publicly or

801
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,700
advertisements and it gives people a

802
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:17,340
chance to actually hear them and then

803
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,809
try to replicate that so this was the

804
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,059
first one that I saw where they had

805
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:23,280
actually kind of blamed it on that now

806
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,660
when I was at RSA earlier this year and

807
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,910
I can't believe it I was still this year

808
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,820
it feels like so long ago

809
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:32,179
there was a booth that was set up and

810
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,080
they were actually doing call centers

811
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:36,570
apparently they handled a lot of call

812
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,549
center stuff and their big thing was

813
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,059
about caching deep fakes in the audio

814
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:44,250
and so I asked the guy said you know

815
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:47,850
have you ever actually seen it happen in

816
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:49,290
the real world yet and his answer was he

817
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,520
kind of pointed to this and I said well

818
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,370
you know that's still kind of under

819
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,049
tibay have you actually seen it and and

820
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:57,870
he had to admit that no they there

821
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:59,129
hasn't been a verified point of it now

822
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,959
that doesn't mean it's not important to

823
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,669
start thinking about it and what their

824
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,120
stuff did is when you call into one of

825
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:07,799
these big data centers they start

826
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,918
looking at you and trying to validate

827
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:12,960
you immediately so this is anti-fraud

828
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,760
measures they're looking for are you

829
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,910
calling from the region you say you're

830
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,799
in is it from a cell phone and now

831
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,409
they're looking at your voice they're

832
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,809
listening to your voice and trying to

833
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:27,389
determine whether there's trickery

834
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:30,299
on with your voice these are not

835
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:32,850
necessarily immediate disqualifiers but

836
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:36,059
by the time you get to a person on the

837
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:38,129
other end you know to actually help you

838
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:40,350
they can actually give you kind of a

839
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:43,019
risk score if you will based on the

840
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,899
sorts of things that have happened even

841
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:47,700
just leading up to that person so it's a

842
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:50,668
very interesting thing I thought it was

843
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,200
a quite eye-opening and if any of you

844
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:53,970
that are on here actually work in a call

845
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,860
center where this is deployed I'd love

846
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,899
to hear more about that please put some

847
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,508
in the chat down there because I think

848
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,008
it's pretty amazing but while I don't

849
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:04,830
think it's happening now I think it's

850
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:06,720
going to continue to happen more and

851
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:09,089
more and even as we start using more

852
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,399
biometrics including voice for

853
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:14,029
authentication I think we're gonna have

854
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:16,770
to be real real careful with this so

855
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:18,270
speak into the detection let's talk

856
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:21,210
about how you detect these things well

857
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:23,579
there's always artifacts available in

858
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,829
whatever is done video voice whatever

859
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:27,230
there's always gonna be artifacts so

860
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:29,579
when you're doing the video stuff

861
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,889
there's gonna be pixel smoothing around

862
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,500
where they cut that 128 by 128 piece out

863
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:36,119
and replace the frame at the face in

864
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,699
there there's definitely going to be

865
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,409
that in there there's compression

866
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,449
artifacts and video now there's ways to

867
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:44,609
try to cover this up so you take a video

868
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:46,408
you create a deep fake and then you re

869
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:48,779
encode it three or four times to where

870
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:50,280
the quality is just utter crap it's

871
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,440
gonna be even harder to pick it out of

872
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,169
that right but there will be compression

873
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,270
artifacts in there in the audio side

874
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:59,549
there's gonna be some artifacts also and

875
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:02,250
this comes down to us being humans we

876
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:04,319
hear sounds in certain ways and our

877
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,390
brain our filters in our brain where we

878
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:08,759
talk about that will actually put these

879
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:11,848
things together and the word is now

880
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,319
something that is identifiable to us if

881
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:16,440
you've ever listened to anyone with a

882
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:18,300
very strong accent some accents are

883
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,849
easier for us to listen to than others

884
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,800
probably on an individual basis but

885
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:24,119
sometimes if you've ever noticed you

886
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,130
don't understand what they're saying

887
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,480
until a second or so after they've said

888
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,800
it that's where your mind is put

889
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,660
together all these different things and

890
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,220
boom now it makes sense to you our

891
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,770
brains are great at putting those pieces

892
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,589
back together the AI a lot of times

893
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,080
we'll put

894
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:44,260
the audio back together for example

895
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:48,330
where it makes sounds that our tongue

896
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:50,290
cannot make that quickly we adjust

897
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:53,080
subconsciously when we say some of these

898
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:55,180
words but our tongue can't be in an S

899
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,400
sound and you know a click sound at the

900
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,230
same time sort of thing it's just not

901
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,840
feasible possible but the AIS will

902
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:05,350
generate that sound pattern and it can

903
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,120
be picked up the waveforms how they're

904
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:09,850
created digitally you can see the

905
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,730
waveforms and spot some of those things

906
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:14,770
now as a eyes get better at this as the

907
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:17,470
tools get better you can expect these

908
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:20,860
things to kind of fall away and become a

909
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:23,350
little bit harder to judge but there are

910
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:26,590
places that are doing this I know

911
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:28,779
YouTube Facebook may already be doing

912
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:31,240
some of this right there's going to be

913
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,580
some automation but what happens is not

914
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:36,240
for everybody not every company is going

915
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:40,270
to be deploying this in their defensive

916
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,500
posture yet the easiest way or one of

917
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,480
the better ways that I think we're gonna

918
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,760
see happening here is using neural

919
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,650
networks to identify neural networks

920
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,810
right we always play that whack-a-mole

921
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,760
game the the bad guys get ahead then we

922
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,860
you know whack that mole and then boom

923
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,990
they pop up over here we're seeing that

924
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,520
an AI and with the attack and defense

925
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,959
side of things as well

926
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,620
but I think that's going to be a key

927
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,890
player in this now what is a problem is

928
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:08,020
the human bias issue so deep fakes will

929
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,490
enhance our prejudices and biases and we

930
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,880
all have them I don't care who you are

931
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:15,069
we all have these biases being you don't

932
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,020
need something high-tech to get inventi

933
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,250
of something you already have to believe

934
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:22,830
in okay so this has never been more

935
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:25,750
apparent than in those romance scams

936
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:28,900
where you actually show somebody the

937
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:31,000
error in what happened like they can't

938
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,490
produce this and then they'll make up

939
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,960
some sort of a deal some sort of a story

940
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,229
about why they couldn't do the picture

941
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,750
or or better yet you show them a photo

942
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,780
of that person that was sent to the

943
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:45,070
victim and another profile and say this

944
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,320
is really what it is and the people go

945
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,660
oh well yeah you know I used that

946
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,520
because I'm trying to stay low from Bo

947
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,509
and that people will believe that

948
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,340
because they already

949
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,400
want to believe that that's the bias

950
00:37:54,340 --> 00:38:00,790
issue and we don't have to have

951
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,430
absolutely perfect face to get people to

952
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:04,779
believe it the fact is the truth is out

953
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,549
there we just have to look for it

954
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,640
meaning we have to take the time to

955
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,890
examine it a little bit and see you know

956
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,480
be critical about what it is we're

957
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:17,379
seeing and hearing especially when it's

958
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,820
something extravagant so how do we

959
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,740
defend ourselves first of all this is a

960
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,810
social engineering thing for social

961
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,450
engineering we always need to understand

962
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:27,310
that it's an emotional attack so if you

963
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,680
get the email the text message the phone

964
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:32,650
call whatever it is and it elicits a

965
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,460
strong emotional reaction take a deep

966
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,920
breath and focus on applying your

967
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,800
critical thinking right there's a system

968
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,720
one system to thinking thing emotions

969
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,260
drive us straight into our kind of

970
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:50,680
primal instinctual emotions and

971
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,720
reactions and it really blocks out the

972
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,509
way that we can think critically so we

973
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,459
have to consciously step back and do

974
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,140
that of course they use greed right the

975
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,150
Nigerian prince scam we all know about

976
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,940
that that's been around for you know

977
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:06,940
since the dawn of time you all know that

978
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,990
happened back before before digital they

979
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,700
used to actually have to like lick

980
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,979
stamps put them on envelopes and send

981
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:14,399
them where now I can send 50,000

982
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,570
phishing emails for 65 bucks you know

983
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,520
that's why that one's still around but

984
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:20,770
greed is a key one there it says

985
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,800
something for nothing curiosity you know

986
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,180
look at clickbait ads they tell you a

987
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,940
little bit don't tell you everything

988
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,819
and now you're curious you want to go

989
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:33,540
check it out it's a like an information

990
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:36,100
gap theory thing on that self-interest

991
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,380
urgency there's almost always a sense of

992
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,480
urgency in that sense of urgency keeps

993
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,090
your mind flooded and your brain flooded

994
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,880
with all of these you know different you

995
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:47,740
know chemicals that really impact how we

996
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,470
can critically think that's why urgency

997
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:53,919
is such a big thing now fear people will

998
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:56,770
tend to back away from fear as much as

999
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,060
they do aggressively go for it so if

1000
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,710
somebody tries to scare them with

1001
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,560
something a lot of people aggressively

1002
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,880
go back but fear is very powerful look

1003
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,920
at some of the scams that we've been

1004
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,690
seeing where

1005
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,280
you know they started but last year I

1006
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,550
think it was beginning in last year saw

1007
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,770
some it's the old you were on an adult

1008
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:16,480
web site and we took care of your you

1009
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,820
know your we took over your webcam and

1010
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,860
filmed you doing stupid things and by

1011
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,880
the way your password is blah blah blah

1012
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,920
blah blah and then they put in a

1013
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,810
password up there that's from a 10 year

1014
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,700
old LinkedIn breach right how many

1015
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:29,080
people saw somebody that was genuinely

1016
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,939
scared by that because they're like oh

1017
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,040
my gosh it's got to be legitimate they

1018
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,180
got my password well you had bigger

1019
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,490
problems on your hand because it was a

1020
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:40,419
10 year old LinkedIn password but that

1021
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:42,189
kind of stuff does get people to react

1022
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,290
in a lot of ways and of course

1023
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:47,200
helpfulness you know this is me I'm

1024
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,980
trapped in the UK I lost my wallet my

1025
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,740
passport I need money to get home or

1026
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,810
this is your nephew Johnny's lawyer he

1027
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:58,209
was stopped by the police said that you

1028
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:59,950
can help him with bail I need you to

1029
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,930
send me some money so I can get him out

1030
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,399
of jail you know that kind of stuff

1031
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,100
targeting the elderly this is all

1032
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,110
helpfulness base stuff so when we're

1033
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:11,020
looking at defending against this it is

1034
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:14,650
really important that we don't try to

1035
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:16,660
get everybody into the technical you

1036
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:19,900
know a knee-deep kind of stuff because

1037
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,549
quite frankly you got people you know

1038
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,080
employees that are accountants you don't

1039
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,690
want them really trying to dig into this

1040
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,390
stuff you really don't you want them to

1041
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:30,010
be able to recognize the lures the

1042
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:34,240
things that are that are yanking their

1043
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:37,150
chains and think about that in a you

1044
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,419
know in a more critical thinking sort of

1045
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,580
way we don't want them doing the

1046
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,220
technical stick to the emotional type

1047
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,960
stuff and then have them report it to

1048
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,339
say one of us that are more technical

1049
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,950
they can look into that did this really

1050
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,450
come from this email this is a social

1051
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,339
engineering red flag that we've been

1052
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,870
putting out for a number of years and I

1053
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:59,050
love it because it gives them a quick

1054
00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:00,460
look so they get something that kind of

1055
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,900
freaks them out a little bit you can

1056
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,220
look at this it reminds them to hover

1057
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,350
the link and all that kind of good stuff

1058
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,879
there's a PDF that's available if you

1059
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,710
want to give it to people but it's

1060
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,780
really powerful because it helps with

1061
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:12,790
that I got an email from HR at two

1062
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,980
o'clock in the morning on a Saturday and

1063
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,810
that's really weird you know

1064
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,430
reminding people that we need to pay

1065
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,720
attention to this sort of stuff

1066
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:22,359
and having a nice little cheat sheet is

1067
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,058
very helpful so that's about all I have

1068
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:27,000
for slides right now this is my contact

1069
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:30,280
information feel free to reach out to me

1070
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,140
any way you want I use the first Twitter

1071
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,780
email account they're the at Eric Crone

1072
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:37,240
is my primary Twitter account that's the

1073
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,819
one I use most often feel free to reach

1074
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,589
out to me there ask me questions I'll be

1075
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:43,509
in the the discord for a little bit here

1076
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:46,390
but I do have to run fairly quickly

1077
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:48,099
after this is done but always always

1078
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:50,230
happy to hear from people and chat a

1079
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:53,829
little bit about that so question Rhys

1080
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:56,740
Michael what do we got out there so we

1081
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:59,859
have blue wolf spirit who's asking what

1082
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,299
if a real video I'm sorry what if you

1083
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:04,240
have a real video and everyone well

1084
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,800
everyone thinks it's fake well depending

1085
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,930
on what's stupid crap you're doing in

1086
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,050
that real video that could be a blessing

1087
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:15,160
for you right that is gonna be the other

1088
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:17,260
side of it right as we get more critical

1089
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,740
of all this stuff we may be willing to

1090
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,049
to do exactly that and discount the real

1091
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,839
things that are going on and that can be

1092
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:27,880
very dangerous in itself if we go that

1093
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,460
route but that's why actually I think

1094
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,170
it's more important to be able to get

1095
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,809
better ways to check those facts through

1096
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,250
reputable sources and be able to see if

1097
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:38,470
that's real I think that's a key thing

1098
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:40,180
to combatting this as well and I didn't

1099
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,069
mention that earlier but I think having

1100
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,890
some sort of a fact-checking way to do

1101
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:49,020
that will help on the the plus and the

1102
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:51,730
minus sides the real and the fake sides

1103
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:55,509
excellent and a follow up to that from

1104
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:58,630
the same person is are there technical

1105
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,890
ways to detect fakes yeah and I did talk

1106
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,380
about those a little bit I don't know if

1107
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,240
that was before that part but the the

1108
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,010
most common way to do it right now is to

1109
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,640
look for those artifacts whether it be

1110
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:12,339
in video whether it be an audio for the

1111
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,598
individual it's a lot tougher because

1112
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:15,099
none of us really have these tools

1113
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,530
around you pretty much need to be

1114
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:19,030
dealing with the larger or higher end

1115
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,609
sorts of things to be able to do that

1116
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:25,049
it's not real common to have those tools

1117
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:25,049
as individuals

1118
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,520
and we have another one here from canary

1119
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,940
how about using face with sock puppets

1120
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:42,520
are we talking like real sock puppets

1121
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,010
like hey you know that sort of thing or

1122
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:48,970
we talking about having fake people

1123
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:50,860
doing a certain you know plays I mean

1124
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:54,069
that's that's where I'm seeing it is the

1125
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:56,200
you know the the sock puppets in the the

1126
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:58,210
scam world where you have somebody

1127
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,000
that's doing actions and then you

1128
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:07,210
replace their face absolutely I see that

1129
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:11,260
going to be happening excellent

1130
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:12,640
um I don't see any other questions on

1131
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,440
the channel just yet

1132
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,410
maybe we'll keep it open for a few more

1133
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,650
minutes we do have some extra time open

1134
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:22,540
so cool yeah I wanted to leave some time

1135
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,770
open here I'll tell you what folks um

1136
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,470
you know since we don't have any

1137
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,460
questions right now I'll say this get

1138
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,580
out there and play with some of these

1139
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,650
tools they they are free although most

1140
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,440
of them tend to lean towards the nvidia

1141
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,570
side sometimes there are some other

1142
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,170
versions that will run on AMD cards and

1143
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,930
things like that

1144
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,760
it doesn't cost you anything to play

1145
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:44,680
around and just grab some 10-second

1146
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,770
clips and see how all this works because

1147
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,359
the more we learn about what it is we're

1148
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:51,070
gonna be facing in the future the better

1149
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:54,160
prepared obviously we're gonna be and

1150
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:56,470
the more able we are to be able to spot

1151
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,879
them there were things that you know

1152
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:00,368
when I first started playing around with

1153
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,109
this that I didn't spot in some of the

1154
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:04,089
deep fakes that we saw out there you

1155
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:06,910
know some of the pretty common ones but

1156
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:09,040
now I have a much better eye towards

1157
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,629
that and I really think that this

1158
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,359
technology given the misinformation

1159
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:18,040
trend that we have going on is going to

1160
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:21,359
be a big deal in our future that's my

1161
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:24,730
little closing rant if you will okay I

1162
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:29,109
have a question for you you had

1163
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:33,130
mentioned a that you had run a test of

1164
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:36,490
this of that software they showed on Gil

1165
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:41,170
from Gil The Voice one or the video one

1166
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:43,660
the video one you have a video that we

1167
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:46,420
could take a look at maybe yeah yeah and

1168
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,549
I'll have to it's on one of my YouTube

1169
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:51,869
pages I just threw it up there to share

1170
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:54,640
during conferences I'll throw it out in

1171
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:56,950
I'll throw it out on the track here in a

1172
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,629
minute when I go get the link to that it

1173
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,740
was just a short one I did with

1174
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:03,190
Spiceworks

1175
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:06,250
and what I did is I took the host just

1176
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:08,410
and on and I put a Elon Musk's face on

1177
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,390
Justin all now this thing that I put

1178
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:13,118
together when you guys see it it took me

1179
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,500
like I think eight hours of training you

1180
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,619
know less than 10 hours to put the thing

1181
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,210
together top to bottom and just knowing

1182
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:21,160
that it took me that a little bit of

1183
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:24,009
time using the absolute

1184
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:26,379
defaults to the program should tell you

1185
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:27,880
how how interesting and how quickly

1186
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,799
we're gonna be getting to where we can

1187
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,079
do some pretty serious stuff there are

1188
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:33,759
some artifacts there's definitely some

1189
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,890
issues with it but given that it was all

1190
00:47:33,759 --> 00:47:37,720
defaults and all in a very short amount

1191
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:44,348
of time I think it's pretty impressive

1192
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:45,629
what the tools can do excellent we have

1193
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:49,059
a couple more questions

1194
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:51,910
Nicole is asking where can I find the

1195
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:54,220
PDF infographic from your last slide I

1196
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,750
can drop it in there too I'm not trying

1197
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,118
to be too corporate but I'll drop a link

1198
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:00,369
to the PDF in there if you guys want to

1199
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,460
go grab it it is a fantastic one or if

1200
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:07,329
you google no be for social engineering

1201
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:09,099
red flags it's there I love that little

1202
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:13,779
tool I really do it's just such a great

1203
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:16,119
reminder for people yeah and then we

1204
00:48:13,779 --> 00:48:19,930
have another question from Reggie could

1205
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:23,980
you comment on ransom fakes on ransom

1206
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:26,410
fakes we're talking about faking

1207
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,970
somebody being kidnapped and doing

1208
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:31,480
ransoms for that is that is that what

1209
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:33,430
we're talking about I believe so okay so

1210
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,259
you know what the thing about that is we

1211
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:36,970
actually saw a trend with this where

1212
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:40,240
they didn't even have anybody and they

1213
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:41,680
were getting paid right yeah I can see

1214
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,990
where this could be used towards that

1215
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,669
but if you look back this was happening

1216
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,410
a couple years ago a lot in Southern

1217
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,849
California

1218
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:51,038
folks would figure out what school

1219
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:53,680
little Timmy went to right maybe off the

1220
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,450
back of the car or Facebook or socially

1221
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,519
you know some other social media

1222
00:48:55,450 --> 00:49:00,038
presence and then what was happening is

1223
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,839
little Timmy goes to school and somebody

1224
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:03,460
reaches out to the parents and says I

1225
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,099
grabbed little Timmy on the way to

1226
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,509
school today if you don't pay me such in

1227
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:10,450
such amount you'll never see little

1228
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:12,640
Timmy again don't contact law

1229
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:15,038
enforcement do not call the school we

1230
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,519
have people there if you do bam Timmy's

1231
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:17,049
a goner

1232
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,689
right and people would actually pay

1233
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:21,099
based on that they'd even take anyone

1234
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,440
and little Timmy he's fat dumb and happy

1235
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:25,509
eating lunch at school mine in his own

1236
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,609
business and has no idea this is going

1237
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:30,039
on so they actually don't even need

1238
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:31,839
people to do ransoming that was an

1239
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:34,089
interesting trend that happened a number

1240
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,660
of times like I said but yeah I can

1241
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:36,880
definitely see

1242
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:39,970
where they're faking that somebody has

1243
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,070
been captured now obviously they're

1244
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:44,439
going to have to move pretty quickly

1245
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:46,330
because nowadays we're all fairly easy

1246
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,430
to get a hold of through phones you know

1247
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:50,529
and and all that kind of stuff so it

1248
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:52,600
would have to be pretty pretty quick

1249
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:55,320
short-lived sort of things kind of like

1250
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,319
the school scam
