1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,840
hello um i am brandon becker here to

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,160
present about pattern interrupts in

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,839
social engineering

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,599
um unfortunately i wasn't able to use

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,360
the camera that i have wanted to use so

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,840
i am recording this on a potato

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,920
hopefully that is not too problematic

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,840
okay so the first thing is uh what our

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,240
pattern interrupts

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,000
uh basically let's talk about social

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,160
patterns first so we can understand what

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,480
interrupting them is all about so uh

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,079
there's all kinds of social patterns

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,760
that we have as a society um

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,239
all behaviors all human behaviors could

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,200
generally be broken down into obtaining

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
a reward or escaping some kind of cost

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
or consequence

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,200
so you're hungry you make a sandwich

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,360
you're you're either you could view that

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,000
as obtaining sandwich or escaping the

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,020
feeling of hunger

23
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,640
[Music]

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,559
so we talk about social patterns things

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
like a handshake which will come back to

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,160
that a few different times throughout

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
this a handshake

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,080
it has some sort of social function i

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
mean the original function was to show

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
that you're not carrying a weapon and

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
indicate that you have you know your

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,400
friendly

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
intentions when you greet someone um

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,360
that's all that original context has

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,119
fallen away most people probably don't

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,640
think about that at all it's just a

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,479
scripted behavior you meet someone on

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,280
friendly terms you shake their hand

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,240
and you don't think about all the

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
individual parts that you just do it you

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
shake hands it happens very

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,119
automatically

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,880
um

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,119
generally social patterns are learned

45
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,119
the way most things are learned modeling

46
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,119
and instruction so you either you see

47
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,040
someone do it and then you imitate that

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,960
or someone specifically taught you here

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,840
is how you shake hands um and then that

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
that's how you learn all those patterns

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,159
but it could cover things like

52
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,680
customs

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,479
uh rules laws

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
uh just just patterned behavior

55
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,399
sometimes there are

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,119
um cultural patterns that are specific

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,680
to a particular job or a particular

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,520
location or a particular

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,119
culture in the traditional sense in

60
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,600
ethnic or religious culture

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,758
and those are patterns

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,360
when you violate a social pattern of

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,200
some kind there's always going to be a

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
cost of that of some sense so for

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,520
example someone came up to you to greet

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
you in a business setting and they

67
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,640
offered you their hand to shake it and

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
you just didn't

69
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
there would be a consequence for that it

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
would be extremely awkward they might

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
think strange of you or be offended or

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,000
something of that nature

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,560
so that's what social patterns are

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,519
and

75
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,200
they are a type of what's called

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
autonomous multi-processing which

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,560
basically

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
means it it happens automatically you

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
don't think about it and it's multiple

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,400
different

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,239
things going on at once and they're sort

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,879
of done together so it's it's not quite

83
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,879
multitasking where you're doing lots of

84
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,560
different parallel things it's a

85
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
sequence of things that happen

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,319
all together

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
as a whole

88
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,760
so uh

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,280
that's one thing to keep in mind another

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
thing to keep in mind is dissociation

91
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
and in this case we're not talking about

92
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
necessarily a symptom of trauma some of

93
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,480
you might think of that when you hear

94
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,879
the word dissociation

95
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,400
in this case we're just talking about

96
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
the very basic concept of

97
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,239
a process that should happen

98
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,080
unified but can become separated okay so

99
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,440
dissociation is something that's

100
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
normally together and is separated and

101
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,080
when we talk about that uh in a

102
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,799
cognitive sense a brain sense it happens

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
all the time

104
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
it can happen if someone's distracted

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,959
from a task that they would normally

106
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,560
attend to

107
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
it can happen

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,799
if

109
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,519
you've ever accidentally felt your own

110
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,599
hair or your own coat brushing you and

111
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,599
it startles you for a second

112
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,000
it's your own movement you you should be

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,760
aware of that but somehow part of it was

114
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,239
outside of your awareness for a moment

115
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,799
those are all dissociative experiences

116
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,319
driving trance where you're on the

117
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,840
highway and you you get to your

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
destination but you don't quite remember

119
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,519
the last five or ten minutes

120
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,959
you weren't asleep

121
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
you were dissociating part of that

122
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,400
experience it just wasn't connected

123
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,920
so that's something to keep in mind

124
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,360
because that's going to be

125
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,320
part of the future explanation

126
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,759
and also keep in mind that learning

127
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,918
always involves abstraction so

128
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,479
essentially this this quote from gutah

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,240
is pretty helpful here the essence of

130
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,160
abstraction is preserving information

131
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,840
that is relevant

132
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
and for getting information that is

133
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
irrelevant in a given context so for

134
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
example if someone tells you a whole

135
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
story of of

136
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
what their problem is at work or how

137
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,240
what a bad day they had you don't

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
archive that whole story

139
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
every single detail in your memory you

140
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
take the most salient points and you say

141
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,759
okay they got in a car accident that's

142
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,880
why they're late and they're quite upset

143
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,479
about it okay

144
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,160
you don't log all of the details of the

145
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,720
whole story

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
and this is important when we talk about

147
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
uh social patterns because

148
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,360
if someone went to shake your hand and

149
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
you had to stop and say okay wait

150
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,520
they're offering their hand i i need to

151
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,199
reach my hand out

152
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,120
i need to meet their hand i need to

153
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
grasp it

154
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,039
gently up gently down gently up gently

155
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,759
down wait is it two times or three times

156
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,000
you can't do all that maybe as a child

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,759
when you're first learning

158
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,160
the patterns the social patterns you do

159
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,560
that or if you're in a new culture or if

160
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,080
you're in a new business culture it

161
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
might take you those first few times of

162
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
learning each step individually but it

163
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,320
becomes scripted and then you just do it

164
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,960
automatically

165
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,320
a non-social example of this would be

166
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000
hopefully when someone is turning when

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,600
they're driving they automatically turn

168
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
their turn signal on it's just a part of

169
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,639
that and then they start to turn the

170
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,080
wheel and they adjust their speed and

171
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
they're checking for people around them

172
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,199
in the various lanes that should all

173
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,039
happen automatically

174
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,560
when you're first learning to drive you

175
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,080
have to pause and think about doing all

176
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,919
those things individually but it becomes

177
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,318
scripted

178
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
okay so what happens when a pattern gets

179
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,600
interrupted um

180
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
the reason i'm using the handshake

181
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
example is because well for one it's a

182
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,960
very common social pattern that many

183
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,280
people are accustomed to but also

184
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,039
because there was this famous

185
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,280
psychiatrist milton h erickson he's the

186
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
father of what's known as erichsonian

187
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,639
hypnosis

188
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,639
and um

189
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,840
he had

190
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,639
famously a hypnotic handshake he he was

191
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
known to give a handshake to people that

192
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,639
was

193
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,880
sort of awkward and

194
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
uh confusing and it would put them in

195
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,039
this light state of trance where they

196
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,600
were very suggestible

197
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,919
it didn't necessarily make them like him

198
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,440
immediately because they were like what

199
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
is going on here this weird handshake

200
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,639
with this kind of meaning

201
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,199
um but he used that that moment of

202
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,960
weirdness to

203
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,080
um

204
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
to accomplish the therapeutic goals that

205
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,360
he had

206
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,599
or that they had together

207
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,000
so the the standard handshake script is

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,360
like this you know there's initial

209
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,440
visual or verbal contact you say hi you

210
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
see the person extend the hand meet the

211
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
hand shake up and down and then you

212
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960
release and that's it that's what it

213
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,280
should be

214
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
well milton

215
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,960
milton uh erickson he

216
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
he wouldn't do that it would be he would

217
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
take their hand and then

218
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
he would

219
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,560
sort of start to

220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,039
gently almost as if was it intentional

221
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
or was an absent-minded

222
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,039
rub part of their hand

223
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,520
and he would have a loose kind of slowly

224
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,960
letting go

225
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,240
grip

226
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,919
and he would hold it there he would

227
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,440
maybe shake once and then just sort of

228
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,759
hold it there he wasn't firm he wasn't

229
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,599
gripping their hand let me dominate you

230
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,680
it was just sort of i'm holding on to

231
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,599
your hand for a moment and while he was

232
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,520
doing that he would continue to keep eye

233
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,240
contact and talk to the people

234
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,400
if something would happen

235
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
something would be strange when he was

236
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
doing that and people would question

237
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,400
what is going on here um

238
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,680
what was happening well i'm going to

239
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
give you an example of what that's like

240
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,919
so take a look at these images and for a

241
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,440
moment try to understand what are the

242
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,960
objects

243
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,758
in these images

244
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
hopefully by now you're starting to

245
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,560
realize there aren't actually any

246
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
objects in these images

247
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,199
these were images created by

248
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
you know deep dreaming software where

249
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,039
they're completely simulated

250
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
they're

251
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,679
parts of images kind of pieced together

252
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,640
but

253
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,719
but nothing actually if you look at

254
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,320
anything very closely you can realize

255
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
that that's not an actual real object

256
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
these are not photographs of real things

257
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
but your brain had a moment there where

258
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,480
you were confused and you were trying to

259
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,120
figure out what the heck am i looking at

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,800
and uh your brain got confused and maybe

261
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
you you quickly came to the conclusion

262
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
of this is not this is not a real photo

263
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
or maybe when i told you then you felt

264
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,200
relief and went oh okay okay it's not a

265
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
real photo that's why i couldn't place

266
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,600
what these things were

267
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,279
some of you might even have determined

268
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,040
that some of those objects were

269
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
particular things one of the

270
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,640
um

271
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,560
examples i can i've run into sometimes

272
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
people say there's on the right side of

273
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
the screen there's definitely a ski mask

274
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
there on the left side of the screen or

275
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,080
there's definitely earrings hanging on

276
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,000
on a case that there aren't those are

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,680
not none of these objects are real but

278
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,120
you might have convinced yourself for a

279
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,480
moment that you were really seeing those

280
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,519
things

281
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,360
and why does that happen it's because of

282
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
what's called a trans derivational

283
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,279
search and some of you computer folks

284
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,640
out there might be familiar with that

285
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
term already

286
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,399
or if there are any cognitive scientists

287
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,839
watching you might be familiar with that

288
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,760
term as well because the term appears

289
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,120
both in computer science and in

290
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,160
cognitive science and basically a

291
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,279
transderivational search

292
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,680
or a tds is

293
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
your brain or a computer saying what is

294
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
the meaning of this i must search all of

295
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,079
my

296
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,079
memory

297
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,399
to find a meaning for what's happening

298
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,480
here and usually our brains are pretty

299
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,519
good at that they can find an answer

300
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,360
for what is happening you hear a strange

301
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,279
sound and your brain will quickly say oh

302
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,440
that was a dog growling okay or you hear

303
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
a strange sound and say oh i'm not sure

304
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
what that was but it sounds like

305
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
movement

306
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
off in the woods while i'm walking at

307
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
night or i'm camping let me at least be

308
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
cautious and sort of concerned about

309
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,079
what that sound might be and your brain

310
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,640
is pretty good at making these judgments

311
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
and that's how we've survived for as

312
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
long as we have but

313
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,760
when it can't immediately or very

314
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,800
quickly

315
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,279
decide what is the meaning of something

316
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,680
this this information that i'm taking in

317
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,800
it gets confused it has that emotional

318
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
and psychological state of confusion

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,680
so there's some examples of this

320
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,360
gibberish

321
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
when we talk gibberish to babies um it's

322
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
part of speech learning now you don't

323
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
you wouldn't only ever talk gibberish

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
and baby talk two babies um but that's

325
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,440
the first things that you do

326
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,680
when you are listening to other people

327
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
you know speak baby talk and gibberish

328
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,079
you can't quite make out what they're

329
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,000
saying because it's not real words the

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,160
same way when you hear language that you

331
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
don't know another language

332
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
you can kind of tell that is language

333
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,120
i'm pretty sure people are communicating

334
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
in this intentional structured way but i

335
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,839
have no idea what they are saying and it

336
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,680
can be very frustrating if you've ever

337
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
been in a situation where someone is

338
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,680
trying to communicate with you

339
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
and you don't share a language it's very

340
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,920
frustrating very quickly

341
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
for both of you usually and this is part

342
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,839
of wise because you're you're searching

343
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,000
for meaning you're trying to understand

344
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,200
and you just can't

345
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
uh but sometimes this comes up even

346
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
within the same language that we have so

347
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,920
i have some examples here of you know

348
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,519
you did it again if you've ever been in

349
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,519
a friendship or a relationship or a

350
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,760
working relationship and someone says to

351
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,880
you you did it again

352
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,720
that's very vague and you quickly have

353
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,959
to ascertain well what did i do again oh

354
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,480
gosh did i leave the cap off the

355
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,920
toothpaste

356
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,839
did i not turn that report in on time

357
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,680
what is it that i did again and you

358
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,600
might be able to from a history or from

359
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
context clues

360
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
reach a conclusion

361
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,480
but that sense of not knowing for sure

362
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,760
can be very frustrating

363
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,000
okay so

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,240
the idea behind this is when we cause a

365
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,720
transderivational search on purpose by

366
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,440
interrupting a social pattern the person

367
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
who's having that pattern interrupted

368
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,639
has to wonder why it's happening now if

369
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,160
you're doing it on purpose you know why

370
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,079
it's happening you're trying to confuse

371
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,399
the person milton h erickson with his

372
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,560
hypnotic handshake was trying to induce

373
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,279
a confused state but the other person

374
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,480
unless they're

375
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
already somehow aware that's what you're

376
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,320
doing they're just going to wonder what

377
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
is the purpose of you shaking my hand

378
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
strangely or whatever other pattern you

379
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
might be interrupting and that's the

380
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,040
basis behind what we're doing here

381
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,519
so this is kind of a long quote from a

382
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,880
research paper but

383
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,279
understand that essentially

384
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,800
what all of this means is

385
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,000
when a brain a human brain is confused

386
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,959
it it requires much more

387
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,200
cognitive effort or much more resources

388
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
being used up by the brain than any

389
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,800
other state

390
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,160
any other state of the mind because the

391
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,480
mind is trying to figure out what it

392
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,040
should do and it cannot so it's it's

393
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
lighting up all over the place

394
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,560
just trying to figure out what am i

395
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
supposed to be lighting up what am i

396
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
supposed to be doing with this

397
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,040
information

398
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,720
and the brain doesn't like doing that i

399
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,639
mean the human body in general wants to

400
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,279
reach a state of of equilibrium or

401
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,760
homeostasis or rest

402
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,079
it doesn't like to be unnecessarily

403
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,600
activated so as soon as the confused

404
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
state begins the human brain starts

405
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,480
saying how do i end this i really don't

406
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,560
want to be confused because it's using a

407
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,680
lot of resources

408
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
so we can use this we can use this to

409
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,800
our advantage and here's some questions

410
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
we want to ask ourselves if we're going

411
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,800
to use this to our advantage in a social

412
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,680
engineering sense

413
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,199
we're going to have to be a little weird

414
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,839
or a little awkward

415
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,199
okay but we don't want to be so weird

416
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,720
that we're off-putting we don't want to

417
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,959
be so awkward that we're noticeably out

418
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,079
of place

419
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,000
so there's a there's a bit of a balance

420
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,199
there

421
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,880
so the question is what's normal for the

422
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,360
setting what gets me closest to my goal

423
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,279
and what arouses the least suspicion and

424
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,440
there's sort of like a venn diagram you

425
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
could do there in that midsection that's

426
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,639
where we want where we want to be

427
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,519
so

428
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,560
there are some classic examples of cons

429
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,040
that use this and social engineering

430
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,199
attacks they use this and i'll give some

431
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,440
of those examples but you can custom

432
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
tailor this to situations that you're

433
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,000
you're coming into in social engineering

434
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,199
and i think

435
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,920
the most useful approach for it is as a

436
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,560
way out or as a way to to misdirect or

437
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,518
redirect someone

438
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
so you might have heard of what's called

439
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,880
a quick change artist

440
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,279
or a short change artist and that's the

441
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,399
idea of someone coming to a cashier and

442
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,800
get paying in cash for a small item with

443
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,440
a large bill and then as the cashier is

444
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
counting out the change

445
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,519
the quick change artist says wait hold

446
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,680
on you know actually can i get and they

447
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,440
ask for different change well they

448
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,040
already have some of the money in hand

449
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,959
and some of the money is in the

450
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,800
cashier's hand

451
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,399
and they exchange it

452
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,000
there are videos of this all over the

453
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,839
internet i didn't include one just for

454
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,759
copyright reasons but you can after this

455
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,399
go go google or youtube

456
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,720
quick change artist shortchange artist

457
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
and you can see videos of this

458
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,360
uh

459
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,759
it relies on people not being good at

460
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,320
math and so as soon as they're asked to

461
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,920
recount

462
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,839
smaller denominations of bills to give

463
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,759
different change that's very confusing

464
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
for them and they sort of what what the

465
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,440
quick change artist is trying to do is

466
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,040
induce a state of confusion and then

467
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,639
they say well you know just give me

468
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,360
those 220s or those 250s or whatever the

469
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,120
case is and then we should be even and

470
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
the cashier very often goes oh yeah okay

471
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,519
and they do that and then they close the

472
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,399
drawer

473
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,759
and the person says okay thanks and

474
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,839
walks away and they're gone and they've

475
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,160
they've gotten you know 50 or 100 or

476
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
whatever dollars back than they really

477
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,440
should have from that exchange

478
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,639
another example is rock paper scissors a

479
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,279
a mentalist effect or a magician that

480
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,279
that does mental

481
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,519
illusions common effect is to use rock

482
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,920
paper scissors to consistently win over

483
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
and over and over and over again and one

484
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,000
of the tricks that mentalists use to do

485
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,399
that is a pattern interrupt

486
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,560
so the first thing i'll say is you have

487
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,440
to know

488
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,880
the country you're in because different

489
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,480
countries or even different parts of the

490
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
country they say this differently you

491
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,240
know where i'm from we say rock paper

492
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,319
scissors other places say scissors paper

493
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,760
rock

494
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,280
okay wherever you're from you need to

495
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,119
know how you're going to be saying it

496
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,959
suppose you were able to say rock paper

497
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,199
scissors that that's how people talk

498
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,640
when they play rock paper scissors where

499
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,839
you're at

500
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,599
what you can do later today to test this

501
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,280
out is go to say hey i want to try

502
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,160
something out i've learned about

503
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,000
something earlier um can we play rock

504
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
paper scissors real quick and they'll

505
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,960
say sure you know you go okay

506
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,080
rock paper what time is it

507
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,440
or something of that if they have a

508
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,679
watch you know you want to ask them or

509
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,600
or all of a sudden point something out

510
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,919
and oh look at that deer just

511
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,720
distraction of some kind

512
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,919
and they're gonna go what the heck are

513
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,200
you doing why are you interrupting like

514
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
that then you go sorry sorry yeah we'll

515
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,919
play

516
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,360
okay

517
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,000
rock paper scissors shoot and then

518
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,160
you should if you if the one that you

519
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,000
stopped them before if the last one in

520
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,080
that sequence is scissors they should

521
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,160
throw scissors so you should throw rock

522
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,360
and the reason for this is you've

523
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
interrupted a pattern their brain is

524
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,039
used to going rock paper scissors you

525
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
call it out loud rock paper scissors

526
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
shoot but if they didn't get to say

527
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
scissors their brain is going to be

528
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
going ah i didn't complete that pattern

529
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
so you're interrupting it before the

530
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,919
last one and then that is the one that

531
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,640
they'll very likely throw

532
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,080
when you let them complete that pattern

533
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,280
then

534
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,160
and so you're going to throw the

535
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
opposite of that try it out later um

536
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,280
it's a very common like i said mentalist

537
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,640
effect it's a silly little thing you can

538
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
do you can only kind of do it once per

539
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,039
victim so to speak but that's another

540
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,760
example of how that would work

541
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,720
there are um social engineers who talk

542
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,520
about

543
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,039
the dropped item

544
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,360
as a useful social engineering tool and

545
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
this is an example of the

546
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,679
the confusion effect or the pattern

547
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,080
interrupt in in that case so here's what

548
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
you would do

549
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
if someone is coming over to ask you

550
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
about are you supposed to be here can i

551
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,080
see your badge you you know you're

552
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
authorized to be in this area

553
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,679
those kinds of questions

554
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,679
and you want to try and redirect from

555
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,280
that um

556
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,880
you're already in pretty deep it's an

557
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
it's a bad situation so you need to

558
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,520
redirect that quickly

559
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,679
this is where as someone is approaching

560
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,440
you and you think that they look like

561
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
they mean business and they kind of want

562
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
to they're going to ask you some tough

563
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
questions before they get to asking you

564
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
questions

565
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,080
you might go to shake their hand very

566
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,240
happily and eagerly as as you know to do

567
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,559
you know play it cool hey how you doing

568
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,400
and as you go to do that

569
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
drop something make it awkward not as if

570
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,200
you are nervous but just you know people

571
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,480
are clumsy

572
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,600
and then

573
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,280
oh my gosh i'm so sorry i make a big

574
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
deal out of cleaning your stuff up and

575
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
as you're doing that

576
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
you take charge of the conversation and

577
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,039
you start asking them questions somehow

578
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,919
to redirect them because if you go to

579
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,320
shake the hand and you interrupt that by

580
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
dropping something and then you initiate

581
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,720
your questions their brain is going to

582
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,440
be

583
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,120
caught in the middle of the pattern and

584
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,919
you have a very brief window

585
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,919
it is seconds at most it may be

586
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,600
milliseconds you have a very brief

587
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,320
window of confusion where they will take

588
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,480
any out to stop being confused and if

589
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,320
that's you start asking them questions

590
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,679
that they can answer

591
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,039
where's the bathroom how do i get to

592
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,400
conference room b

593
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,600
um

594
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
do you know if jim is in today those

595
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,679
kinds of things

596
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,559
they can start answering that and then

597
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,000
their mind is going to be on that track

598
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,240
instead of the track that they were on

599
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,760
now there are some people who are very

600
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,440
determined they don't care what you're

601
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,320
saying you're doing they're going to

602
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,000
come ask you are you allowed to be here

603
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,840
where's your badge and that's a certain

604
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,200
type of individual that's going to do

605
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,880
that but many people if they were going

606
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
to come and you go to initiate that

607
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,720
handshake and then you interrupt it

608
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,960
this confusion technique will help you

609
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,039
reroute their brain because of the

610
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,240
transderivational search

611
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,240
there are all kinds of ways you can use

612
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,600
pattern interrupts it could be

613
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,360
any social pattern

614
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
that you can break

615
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,840
so

616
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,679
from the blue team side of things how

617
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,120
could how could you tell if you're being

618
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,640
worked how could you tell if someone is

619
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
trying to use a confusion technique or

620
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,760
pattern interrupt on you

621
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,440
so you want to you want to look at

622
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,000
some questions from your blue team side

623
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,240
which is what is the person's intention

624
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,360
and how do we know what their intention

625
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,600
is our boundaries being tested or pushed

626
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,720
across

627
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,679
so for example if

628
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,440
if you made it very clear that you want

629
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,720
them to stay over there and they keep

630
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,799
coming closer that's a physical boundary

631
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,960
if they come into a restricted area and

632
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
just start talking to you that's a

633
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,400
boundary being crossed

634
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,200
if

635
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,640
they start asking you about you know

636
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
personal or unusual questions that's a

637
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,679
boundary being crossed

638
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,520
and look for things such as misdirection

639
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,640
evasion

640
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
and justification um if someone the

641
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,440
justification comes about more often

642
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
when someone's actually a bad actor as

643
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,600
opposed to uh pen testing or something

644
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,120
like that

645
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,679
but misdirection and invasion um those

646
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,280
are things you're going to look for and

647
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,400
you're always trained to look for those

648
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
things but look for them in a pattern

649
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,960
interrupt context if you're seeing

650
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,520
people breaking social patterns

651
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,760
at awkward moments that's something that

652
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,159
you want to you want to question

653
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,559
let the answer for your own confusion be

654
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,520
this person could be working me

655
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,799
and what i would like you to also pay

656
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,880
attention to is

657
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,720
operating outside of someone's normal

658
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,200
awareness so you might be aware that

659
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
people tend to be

660
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,720
very queued into visual or auditory or

661
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
kinesthetic

662
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
awarenesses so some people are more

663
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,679
visual more auditory etc and if someone

664
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,679
is very acutely

665
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,960
tuned into visual things you would try

666
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,919
to

667
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,159
operate outside of that pattern because

668
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,280
if you if you interrupt

669
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,880
their field of vision

670
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,120
their visual experience they will notice

671
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,200
that that is weird more quickly so

672
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,080
someone is very kinesthetic

673
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,799
and you do a handshake interrupt they're

674
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,159
going to notice that that's weird and

675
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,400
and be on off put by that more readily

676
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,919
than someone who's more visual or

677
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,919
auditory so just keep those things in

678
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,919
mind you want to try and quickly

679
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,760
ascertain or if you've done lots of

680
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,080
oceans and you know that someone is like

681
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
a martial arts expert okay i'm not going

682
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
to do a handshake interrupt on them

683
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,880
they're more kinesthetic they're going

684
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,000
to notice that quickly so um use the

685
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,320
information you have to determine what

686
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,039
patterns whether it's visual auditory or

687
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,720
kinesthetic

688
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,880
work outside of their keyword

689
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,559
so just a few final thoughts on how to

690
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,320
use this

691
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,080
pattern interrupt in a social

692
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,760
engineering sense

693
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,679
basically anytime you're trying to

694
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,279
get out

695
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,240
or get to some information very quickly

696
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,720
and you think that a bit of confusion

697
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,480
can throw someone off in a way that's

698
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,080
not

699
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,919
going to draw too much attention to you

700
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,520
so

701
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,400
again basic steps are try and figure out

702
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,279
what social pattern you can interrupt

703
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,400
ask a question or give a direction to

704
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
rescue them from that confusion

705
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,960
um and try to operate outside of their

706
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,559
key awarenesses so if they're very

707
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,039
visual make it kinesthetic or auditory

708
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,640
if they're very auditory make it visual

709
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,039
or kinesthetic and if they're

710
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,799
kinesthetic make it

711
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,279
auditory or visual

712
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,440
and i've left time for questions so if

713
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,840
you have any you can ask them after this
