17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,920
weight to anything i say um so my name

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,440
a little who am i my most important job

right now is being a mom to my amazing

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,480
three and a half year old

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
who if you follow me on twitter you

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,559
probably know i refer to him as bubs and

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,359
he is especially gifted with autism um

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,359
he's wicked smart and totally keeps me

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,559
on my toes um so i started my path to

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,479
infosec in

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,600
not in completely traditional way

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
i retired from being a police officer

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,840
having worked the last half of my career

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
as a detective i investigated special

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,000
victims crimes which included child

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
abuse child death and homicide sexual

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
abuse and online child exploitation

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,960
or what now is sometimes referred to as

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,200
child sexual assault material i worked

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,880
on the secret services electronics

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,119
crimes task force um the secret service

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,640
has a training facility called the

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
national computer forensics institute

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,520
out in hoover alabama and it was there

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
that i was trained in digital forensics

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,040
investigations

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,680
um after getting pregnant with the bubs

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
i decided to get out of law enforcement

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
um my oldest son told me that he used to

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,840
spend a lot of time worrying about me

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
when i you know if i was going to come

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,200
home or not and i knew i didn't want to

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
worry my family anymore

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,159
so prior to my forensics training

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,759
i had earned my degree in applied

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,079
psychology um and i have a minor in

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,680
forensic psychology

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,600
after my agency lost their forensic

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,239
examiner um they came to me as i had

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,399
shown an interest in the past and

58
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,640
had been trained on a kind of down and

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
dirty level to do mobile forensics

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
when he was out on paternity leave so

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,440
they came to me and i

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
obviously agreed and was super excited

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,920
actually to get into forensics and

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,599
that's really when i found my love of

65
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
all things computer and cyber and

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
decided to make a change in my career

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840
trajectory

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
my

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,000
my bonus dad that i had growing up he

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
was a software engineer and i never

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
thought in a million years that i would

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,319
want to do anything computer related um

73
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,239
so it's always kind of a funny joke

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,280
between us

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,200
i used to say to him

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,840
you know when he would show me um like

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,360
the code that he was working on and he

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,599
did a lot of stuff you know dos prompt

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,000
that's you know how far back it was and

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,519
he would show me and it would take him

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,560
you know

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
15 minutes to write code to like turn

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
some little button blue and i used to

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,599
think to myself you poor man your life

85
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,560
must be so boring and um so now he jokes

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
with me and tells me your poor thing

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,239
when i'm doing stuff that i'm really

88
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,760
excited about

89
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
um so

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,200
yeah so with my my secret service

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,519
training um i was actually able to apply

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,360
um to enter the digital forensics

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,519
master's program um with the university

94
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,080
of florida go knights and eventually i

95
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
earned my master's degree as well in in

96
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
digital forensics so i started looking

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,760
around kind of to see what jobs were out

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,319
there and um to kind of

99
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,040
hone my study path in digital forensics

100
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,599
and i found this sock roll with a large

101
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,280
defense contractor and i had no idea

102
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,319
what i was getting into i didn't know

103
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,080
what a sock was um they actually didn't

104
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,920
call it a sock in the

105
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,200
description

106
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
but i really had no idea what i was

107
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,439
getting in for but

108
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,920
i met all but one requirement and um

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,599
that requirement was for a bachelor's in

110
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,000
a computer-related field um i figured

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,319
since i was in the df program i hope

112
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,080
that it would make a difference and it

113
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,640
did um i applied and was eventually

114
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
hired and then a couple of years later i

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
moved on to my current role um which is

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,238
a threat research analyst with mandia

117
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,040
um the tldr of my role at mandiant is

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,918
basically that i get to take technical

119
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,000
research of tactics techniques and

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
procedures of adversaries

121
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,960
such as abt groups fin groups pretty

122
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,199
much any cyber threat actor that is

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,400
relevant

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
and i get to break down those ttps into

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,960
their basic behaviors and then replicate

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,520
them within our validation platform so

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,919
that our customers can use our content

128
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,240
to validate their security controls

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
i work with a team of analysts and

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,360
engineers as part of a team called the

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,759
behavioral research team or brt

132
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
but more specific to this talk

133
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,199
i've been trained in interviewing

134
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,720
interrogations by one of the founding

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
members of the fbi's behavioral analysis

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
unit

137
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,199
homeland security

138
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,479
and some of the best homicide and sex

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,000
crimes detectives

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,400
i've ever had the pleasure to know

141
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
during my undergrad i spent a lot of

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,600
time

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
learning about human behavior

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,639
i

145
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,639
wanted to be the best detective i could

146
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,600
be i wanted to right wrongs both put bad

147
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,520
guys in jail and keep

148
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
good guys out of jail

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
good interview techniques are really

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,680
just about rapport building and learning

151
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
to recognize body language facial

152
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,039
changes

153
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
and anything else that is not part of

154
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
the person's baseline behavior

155
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
everyone is different and we're going to

156
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,240
discuss how to apply techniques that

157
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
will work with a variety of different

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,840
types of people and situations

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,199
so what are we going to cover um so

160
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,320
we're going to talk a bit about the

161
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
psychology behind social engineering and

162
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
different human traits that social

163
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
engineers often take advantage of that

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,759
we can take advantage of to help set an

165
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,840
atmosphere to create the best

166
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,919
environment for you to connect with your

167
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,720
interviewers so that you can both decide

168
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,479
if something is the right place for you

169
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,520
to work

170
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
and to give yourself the best stage to

171
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,199
present yourself

172
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,360
it's just as important to ask your

173
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
interviewers the right questions to make

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,560
sure that you want to work there too

175
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
um so

176
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,319
we're going to talk about what we need

177
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,319
to do before the interview what we

178
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,319
actually need to do

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,319
during the interview and this is going

180
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
to be the actionable part of this talk

181
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,240
where i highly recommend jotting down

182
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
some notes

183
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
you might want to remember

184
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
if you

185
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,080
don't have notes that's fine the slides

186
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,800
will be available on my github shortly

187
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,759
if they aren't already by the time um

188
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,840
this comes around so um

189
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
and then i think that will probably have

190
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,960
some time afterwards for um you know

191
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
questions

192
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,280
so don't know how to say chris's last

193
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
name you might know him as um uh the

194
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
human hacker on twitter uh chris hadnaji

195
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,000
had maggie he wrote the the book social

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
engineering the science of human hacking

197
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
and i i think he says it best that

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,199
social engineering is understanding how

199
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,840
and why we make our decisions and what

200
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,800
motivates us to make those decisions

201
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,000
of course chris was talking about

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,919
understanding motivations so we can best

203
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,520
defend against negative social

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,479
engineering

205
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,919
where we're going to talk about how to

206
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
use these principles in a positive way

207
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,560
to make sure we

208
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
know how to best connect with our

209
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,520
interviewers so that we both can make

210
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
the best hiring decision

211
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,120
so if you thought

212
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
that social engineering the interview

213
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
was going to be about how to manipulate

214
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,720
the situation i'm sorry to disappoint

215
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,520
you

216
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
um it's not we're going to use social

217
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,240
engineering principles to

218
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
kind of create a stage for us to best

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
show ourselves

220
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,080
and to best get to know our interviewers

221
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,240
so that we can determine if this is a

222
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,160
place that you know you want to work

223
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
so

224
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,280
whether you were the interviewer or the

225
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,919
interviewee you have an agenda

226
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,680
right your agenda may be getting your

227
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
dream job or it might be finding the

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
person best suited for the job either

229
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
way we can use knowledge of human

230
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
behavior

231
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
to accomplish this

232
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,799
most of this presentation is going to be

233
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,320
geared towards the interviewee but it

234
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,640
can easily be extrapolated to be used by

235
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,958
an interviewer as well

236
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,718
in fact i highly recommend it

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
one of the traits that social engineers

238
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
use in order to gain access to an

239
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
unauthorized area or to manipulate a

240
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,040
situation is with trust

241
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,279
it's part of the reason that somebody

242
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,160
can talk their way into an area of an

243
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
organization that they don't normally

244
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
have permission to access

245
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
if a person looks like they should be

246
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,720
there

247
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,480
and talks like they should be there

248
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,640
people will often grant that trust to

249
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,880
them

250
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
well this seems pretty obvious what you

251
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,080
may not realize is that even if you

252
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,320
aren't an extroverted or super

253
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
charismatic person you can still

254
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,839
accomplish this okay i promise

255
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,480
i'd also like to mention here that

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,839
everything i'm going to present to you

257
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,399
today is backed by scientific data

258
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,480
interestingly we used to think that

259
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,720
stuff like being charismatic likable

260
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,320
persuasive persuasive was an art or

261
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,480
something that you were just inherently

262
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,760
born with

263
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,080
well i'm here to tell you that it is not

264
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,040
that this is a skill that almost anyone

265
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
can learn to acquire and use

266
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,640
successfully i say almost because you

267
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,040
know some people um

268
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,000
may have some kind of neural divergence

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,959
that

270
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,839
might not allow them to

271
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,880
um you know fully use some of these

272
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
principles but i think for the most part

273
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,040
um if you're watching this you probably

274
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,000
have a good pretty good you know ability

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,279
to to uh do it

276
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,399
okay

277
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,000
so let's talk about what we need to do

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
before the interview

279
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
because getting our dream job requires

280
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,640
some legwork well really keyboard work

281
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,040
um we need to do some homework so what's

282
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,800
going on in this place have there been

283
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
any recent acquisitions that are

284
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
relevant to the position

285
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
for which i'm interviewing

286
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,120
um compile any questions that you have

287
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,640
and that you may want to ask your

288
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,959
potential new employer this is super

289
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,640
important and we're going to circle back

290
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
around to this later but for now i want

291
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,279
you to plan to do a bit of recon and

292
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,720
learn about the organization and

293
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
specifically the team for which you're

294
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
applying

295
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,680
take notes on the company if that'll

296
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,680
help

297
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
all right so don't kill me

298
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,720
but dress for success really is a thing

299
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,279
all right the first thing people see is

300
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,680
going to have an impact on their opinion

301
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,640
of you

302
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
all right again this is all scientific

303
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,279
research

304
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
um

305
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,519
luckily the tech world is pretty open to

306
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,600
forms of expression being visible such

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,360
as colored hair tattoos piercings

308
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,519
but let's have a talk about hygiene

309
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,480
shall we

310
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,160
um let's make sure that we're going into

311
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,480
the interview with clean hair deodorant

312
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,079
and clean clothes

313
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,279
i am not asking you to go crazy here

314
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,160
okay i'm i just want you

315
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
to show

316
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,600
that you give up

317
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
about your appearance

318
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,839
because subconsciously we believe that

319
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,360
those who are concerned about stuff like

320
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
their appearance are going to care about

321
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,399
their work output or product

322
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,240
so find yourself the best clothes you

323
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,480
have if you don't have anything and you

324
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
don't have a ton of money go to a thrift

325
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,160
store grab a pair of slacks maybe a polo

326
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,079
you can even go for the gusto and wear a

327
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,200
suit

328
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,320
if you're online just grab a nice shirt

329
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,120
um and speaking of online all right

330
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,240
show your face all right we're in an odd

331
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,959
time and place where a lot of if not

332
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,880
most of our interviews especially for

333
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,440
remote positions are being done via zoom

334
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,800
teams etc

335
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,880
and it's still an interview

336
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
all right you are still trying to

337
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
impress these people with your elite

338
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
skills so that they will want to hire

339
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,519
you

340
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,279
even if the interviewer doesn't show

341
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,839
their face which is might be weird and

342
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,440
potentially a red flag

343
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,399
still show yours okay this helps portray

344
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,920
that you are bringing your best self to

345
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
this interview and that you have nothing

346
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
to hide

347
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,959
part of social engineering interview is

348
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,600
for people to know who you are

349
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
as we are going to discuss you have a

350
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
better chance of getting hired if people

351
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,560
like you

352
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
you don't have to like it

353
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,399
and i'm sorry if you don't but it's part

354
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,639
of human nature we are naturally drawn

355
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,720
to those people who we like

356
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,680
um what we can visualize has a better

357
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,600
chance of happening than what we can't

358
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,920
envision what does that mean well it

359
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,079
means that if the interviewer can't

360
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,320
visualize you working there then you

361
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,519
probably won't

362
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,839
um one big focus in our interview is

363
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,320
going to be to get them to visualize us

364
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
working there but we're going to get a

365
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,439
little ahead of ourselves so

366
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
okay

367
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,440
so what do we actually need to do all

368
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,079
right let's start with meeting the

369
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,079
interviewers all right we want to extend

370
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,800
a warm and genuine greeting genuine

371
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,320
i know we aren't really shaking hands

372
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,199
these days so try to make eye contact

373
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,079
and smile warmly and genuinely smiling

374
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,480
puts people at ease if shaking hands

375
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,240
like in the future becomes a thing then

376
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
a firm handshake and a smile is gonna go

377
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
a long way

378
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,760
if you're decent small talk have a

379
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,160
little small talk before you get started

380
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
this can help you

381
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,839
kind of ease

382
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,760
put yourself at ease as well as the

383
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,360
interviewer

384
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
however

385
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
don't be unauthentic i don't even know

386
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
if that's work but you know what i mean

387
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,639
people can always tell when someone is

388
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
forcing it so if something is in your

389
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
forte

390
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,079
forego it and find something that is

391
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,320
all right so we're not going to spend a

392
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
ton of time here the interview is mostly

393
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,600
going to ask you the typical questions

394
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
you should be expecting

395
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,480
in your recon phase

396
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,079
you should

397
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,680
look up potential questions that you may

398
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,800
be asked

399
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
and i would hope you've studied those

400
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,000
notes

401
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,920
so once we're in the interview and

402
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,560
having those questions given to us

403
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,360
um

404
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
let's remember a few things

405
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,560
first and foremost try to stay calm take

406
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,440
some deep breaths before you start if

407
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
you need a moment to compose yourself

408
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,880
take a moment and then answer the

409
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,079
questions

410
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,760
likely there's no time limit if you're

411
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,360
face to face

412
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,519
and

413
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
you really want to get your best self

414
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
out there right so no interviewers

415
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
really expecting everyone to have the

416
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,199
world's most perfect answers they

417
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
understand that you are probably nervous

418
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,240
okay

419
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
so if you need a moment to kind of

420
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,560
settle your brain then take moments most

421
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,320
importantly here if you don't know the

422
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,000
answer to a question

423
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
do not answer it as if you do all right

424
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,440
um there's something to be said for

425
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
confidence but

426
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
confidence in places that you should be

427
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
confident right if we don't know the

428
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,320
answer let's not even try to pretend

429
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,639
that we do all right if it's a question

430
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,959
that maybe you have an idea on maybe

431
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,040
something that's somewhat open for

432
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,920
interpretation then say that um i have

433
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,360
said in the past i'm not 100 sure but

434
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
here's what i think the answer is based

435
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,320
on

436
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
other prior experience knowledge based

437
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
on what you've given me so far

438
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,480
um you know or if it's a question that

439
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,800
requires a pretty definitive answer

440
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
meaning

441
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,759
it really does have a right or wrong

442
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,160
answer like what is 139 typically used

443
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,120
for um

444
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
and you don't know the answer

445
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,079
then what i would say to that is i would

446
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,199
say i don't have that committed to

447
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,199
memory but i do know that i could find

448
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,519
it here or i have a bookmark with this

449
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,360
info or something like i would do a

450
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,839
duckduckgo search for this search term

451
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,560
um rarely in this business

452
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
is there something that we can't stop a

453
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,639
moment to figure out the best course of

454
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,600
action

455
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,279
or learn about a new concept we haven't

456
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,360
previously been exposed to so we can

457
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,199
best solve a problem

458
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,360
knowing where to find the info is just

459
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
as important

460
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,399
in my opinion at least um

461
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,040
as it as the info itself

462
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,880
albert einstein is famously quoted as

463
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,120
saying i never commit to memory anything

464
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,279
that can easily be looked up in a book

465
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,880
and i totally believe that i have a

466
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,320
zillion different bookmarks for all

467
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,120
those things because i don't have

468
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,079
all of the ports memorized i have basics

469
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
memorized but i might not know what

470
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,799
something is and so um being able to say

471
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,400
this is where i would go and find it

472
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
that's what the employer needs to know

473
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,400
we are in a place where a lot of our job

474
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,199
in tech is googling somebody else has

475
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
probably already found the answer and

476
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,480
they've already you know asked that

477
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,959
question and and so

478
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,600
um we have information at our fingertips

479
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,520
so it's not it's not completely unheard

480
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,080
of to say i might google that and figure

481
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
that out

482
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960
so

483
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,799
it's kind of hard to win people over

484
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,400
with how awesome we are during the

485
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,640
traditional portion of the interview we

486
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,520
are mostly answering questions asked

487
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
of us to determine our knowledge and

488
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,440
experience base right and i'm sorry my

489
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
dears but i can't help you social

490
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,160
engineer your way through having the

491
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,960
right answers um and we really can't

492
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
hypnotize them to think we have all the

493
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,280
answers so what's next well

494
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,760
it's what i like to call the reverse

495
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,240
interview

496
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,760
but first let's talk a little bit about

497
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,520
the psychology okay and ethics

498
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,679
so you know i had to address it right

499
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,679
um dr robert c

500
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,240
i i apparently picked publications where

501
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,320
i can't pronounce the author's name um i

502
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,240
think it's cialdini c-i-a-l-d-i-n-i

503
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,440
anyways dr robert c is the author of a

504
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,360
new york times bestseller um book called

505

influence and he has a company called

506
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,240
influence at work and he's conducted a

507
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,520
bunch of research at various

508
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,799
universities

509
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,440
on pretty much this subject of kind of

510
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,120
using

511
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,320
um

[Music]

514
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,799
kind of building strong relationships at

515
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,039
work and how to go about doing that it's

516
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,240
very similar to the principles from um

517
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
from social engineering he just works in

518
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,360
a completely different field

519
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,520
he has reported that there are six major

520
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,559
factors or principles that when employed

521
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,480
ethically

522
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
increases our ability to build and

523
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,440
maintain stronger relationships at work

524
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,480
at the end of the day whether you're

525
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,799
looking for a new job or looking for a

526
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,160
new employee

527
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
we want the end result to be successful

528
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
we want to find the right fit for us and

529
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
the company wants to find the right fit

530
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,880
as well

531
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,480
when we're in a successful and

532
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,120
satisfying role at work studies have

533
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,200
shown that we are more likely to have

534
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
happier home lives as well you know we

535
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
work 40 hours or more

536
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,919
with these people with this employer we

537
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,919
need to make sure that where we're

538
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,960
working demonstrates similar values to

539
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,559
our own

540
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,000
and i will point out that some of these

541
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,320
principles can easily be used in other

542
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,559
relationships in our lives as well so

543
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,879
it's just something to keep in in mind

544
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,520
all right so

545
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,280
dr c called them principles of

546
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,919
persuasion

547
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,360
and i'm going to highlight just a few of

548
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,400
them

549
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
that we can directly apply in our job

550
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,440
interviews

551
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,120
and like i said really in all

552
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,678
aspects of relationships

553
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
so these principles come from scientific

554
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,360
research into human behavior and using

555
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,000
our knowledge of human behavior behavior

556
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,320
to help us form relationships with our

557
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,799
interviewers or interviewees so that we

558
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,919
can best showcase ourselves or the team

559
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,360
or the employer

560
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,200
remember we're not trying to manipulate

561
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,640
the situation

562
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,720
all right i attended a law enforcement

563
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
leadership training many years ago and

564
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
the single biggest thing i took away

565
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,600
from it probably the only thing i really

566
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,799
remember from

567
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,080
was a quote by one of the um

568
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,240
the keynote speakers

569
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,120
and

570
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,799
the quote was we can't motivate others

571
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,200
but what we can do is we can create an

572
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,480
environment

573
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,840
in which others can motivate themselves

574
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,559
holy cow that was a really big kind of

575
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,120
mind-blowing thing for me how that

576
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,400
applies here is that we aren't

577
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,640
manipulating the interview we are

578
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,080
creating an environment that allows us

579
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,200
to showcase our best selves

580
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,760
because interviews often times like that

581
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
is our time

582
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
to really

583
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
shine to really let these people know

584
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,720
about us

585
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,360
and for them to know that we're gonna be

586
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,559
a good fit because honestly one of the

587
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,240
biggest

588
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,280
um

589
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,000
challenges in creating a team of people

590
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,559
that are going to work together is not

591
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,440
just making sure that you know how to

592
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,840
dot your eyes and cross your t's right

593
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,720
it's not just making sure that you know

594
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,200
what the difference is between

595
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,559
you know a proxy and a firewall or um

596
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
you know it's not just the technical

597
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,880
portion of it right

598
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
if we have people that understand that

599
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,320
that's wonderful but we need people to

600
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,559
to really kind of mesh because you know

601
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,840
you're gonna be working very closely

602
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
with these people and it really is

603
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,480
important that the whole team is able to

604
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,120
work as a team together

605
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,159
and so

606
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,400
during the interview we need to make

607
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
sure that

608
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,720
our interviewer knows that we are the

609
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,120
type of person who's going to mesh well

610
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,480
with this team

611
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,440
or

612
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,679
we realize through our own reverse

613
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,080
interview that this isn't the team for

614
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
me all right we're going to talk about

615
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,760
that more later but

616
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
if you um if you look at this side we

617
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
see that some of the principles of

618
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,919
persuasion include that we like people

619
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,520
who are similar to us

620
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,200
pay us compliments

621
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,039
work toward a mutual goal in a

622
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,799
cooperative fashion

623
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,320
listen to us

624
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,600
this is really going to come into play

625
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,919
later as well as the last point here

626
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,799
which is that we are as gen as humans

627
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,960
generally like people who ask us about

628
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,320
ourselves and are engaged and interested

629
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,280
in what we have to say

630
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,520
so as you can probably see a lot of

631
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
these principles are used by social

632
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,320
engineers in nefarious ways right by

633
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,760
paying hollow compliments a social

634
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,440
engineer may be able to get a person to

635
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,799
find them charming

636
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,480
and like i've mentioned and we'll

637
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,799
mention again people respond to people

638
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,840
they like

639
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,320
um some of these points show how that

640
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,280
happened

641
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
um and just to reiterate we aren't going

642
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,720
to negatively social engineer our

643
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,440
interviewers into anything we're simply

644
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,600
using these principles to create that

645
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,080
environment so that we can best showcase

646
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,159
ourselves to our interviewers

647
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,480
even if we did discuss how to negatively

648
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,559
social engineer our way into a job role

649
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,159
or tried to

650
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,840
what we need to understand is that

651
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,559
studies have shown dr c specifically

652
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,200
mentioned that you know if you

653
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,279
if you're deceptive

654
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,679
and that deception is uncovered later it

655
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,760
actually will do more damage

656
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,880
because the light is going to be

657
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,559
eventually uncovered

658
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,520
and

659
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,039
that could result in a myriad of

660
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,240
negative consequences such as the loss

661
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
of that job uh difficulty finding a job

662
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,840
in the future because people talk and it

663
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,600
may not be your boss it could be just

664
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
you know co-workers

665
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
somebody says oh hey i didn't used to

666
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,760
work with so and so oh yeah

667
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,200
they said they knew all this stuff but

668
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
they really didn't

669
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,679
and

670
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,600
word travels and it can be very

671
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,640
difficult to find a job after it's been

672
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
you know after it's been revealed that

673
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,039
you lied to your previous employer

674
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,279
um

675
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,159
and then like depending on the severity

676
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,240
of the lie and the nature of the light

677
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
you could be looking at legal action as

678
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,360
well

679
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,880
so let's just kind of leave it at the

680
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,120
hippocratic oath of do no harm and while

681
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,720
i know that that historically applies to

682
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,840
physicians um it isn't just for doctors

683
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
and can totally be applied here as well

684
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,080
all right

685
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,960
so

686
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,799
in the traditional q a portion of the

687
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,799
interview the interviewer is running

688
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,279
this show right but now we want to

689
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,880
reverse this a little bit

690
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
when i was a detective i always crafted

691
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,120
my interviews with people in such a way

692
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,039
to create an environment that would put

693
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,240
them at ease all right create a rapport

694
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,480
and hopefully gain the information that

695
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,880
i needed to successfully investigate a

696
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,840
case

697
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,200
i'm not going to talk about police

698
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,039
officers and their tactics i'm well

699
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,559
aware that there are officers out there

700
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,720
who are not ethical

701
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,640
however my approach

702
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
was always to simply find the truth as

703
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
corny as that sounds

704
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,240
once i had the truth or as close to it

705
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,480
as i could get i would be able to make

706
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,799
the best decision about the next course

707
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,679
of action so remember i investigated sex

708
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,440
crimes child deaths such as accidental

709
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,600
deaths potential homicide

710
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
i mean these are the types of crimes

711
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,080
that can ruin a person's life just with

712
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,679
an accusation

713
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,840
and let me tell you it feels just as

714
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,720
good to exonerate an innocent person as

715
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,600
it does to put a child molester um or a

716
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,960
baby killer in prison for the rest of

717
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,720
their lives so

718
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,440
um but we first have to get the truest

719
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
information and to do that

720
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,320
we need to get a positive rapport with

721
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
whomever we're talking to

722
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,720
so how do we do this

723
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,360
i'm so glad you asked

724
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,520
um

725
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,760
what i'm going to teach you is how to

726
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,400
interview your interviewer

727
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,919
when i was hired with mandy at my

728
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,919
awesome recruiter elliott who i give

729
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,080
ginormous shouts out to he gave me the

730
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,799
absolute best advice i've ever been

731
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,120
given before an interview

732
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,960
i was looking to relocate from florida

733
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,559
to dc

734
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,880
and it was going to be just me and my

735
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,840
bubs and elliot said to me

736
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
interview them just as hard as they

737
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,919
interview you

738
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,760
my very first thought was oh my gosh how

739
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,679
are they gonna interview me

740
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,679
but he reminded me that i was looking to

741
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,960
relocate my entire life there

742
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,200
he said make sure these people and this

743
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,720
job is worth it

744
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,600
good god that was so mind blowing to me

745
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,240
my focus had been on

746
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,880
getting these people to

747
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,640
you know to to like me and to want i

748
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,039
wanted to show them that i was who they

749
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,600
wanted to answer or answer who they

750
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,480
wanted to hire

751
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,240
but like when he said that to me my

752
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,360
focus was immediately like oh okay i

753
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,200
know how to do this

754
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,000
so

755
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,360
first

756
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,200
we want to build a rapport

757
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,600
okay and if possible we want to endear

758
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,279
them to us right

759
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,480
um the secret though is we don't say

760
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
anything for that to happen

761
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,000
we're actually going to ask our

762
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,559
interviewers about themselves and most

763
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,799
people actually don't mind talking too

764
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,279
much about themselves to an extent you

765
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,200
know we're not doing any deep probing

766
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,840
questions that are personal

767
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,399
um but it you know it makes people feel

768
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,000
good for someone to be interested in

769
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,480
them and you know some more or less than

770
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,960
others but

771
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,720
okay so like i mentioned we're going to

772
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,880
keep it strictly professional okay a

773
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,120
great starting point and where we're at

774
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,279
at this point is we are at the point

775
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,880
where you know the interviewer says you

776
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,240
know they ask all your questions they

777
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,279
ask all their questions they say well

778
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,720
that's all my questions do you have any

779
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,039
questions and the answer is yeah i do

780
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,440
actually i have a few questions and i

781
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,760
usually try to say like um i'm curious

782
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
like how long have you been here how

783
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,520
long have you worked here and they give

784
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,679
you an answer and so

785
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,080
when we ask these questions what we want

786
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,919
to do at this point is listen all right

787
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,320
it's really not that difficult so we're

788
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,760
going to ask appropriate follow-up

789
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,840
questions and we're going to take our

790
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,720
time

791
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,120
this is your time to both learn

792
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,159
information share information and figure

793
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,840
out if you want to work with these

794
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,640
people or to show them that they want to

795
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,159
work with you

796
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,520
honestly it should probably be a little

797
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,600
of both

798
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,320
excuse me one of my now co-workers

799
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,360
told me

800
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,039
um he had told me about that he had

801
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,640
actually left the company because he had

802
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,200
been promised you know the world

803
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,760
and um when he when that wasn't the case

804
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
he decided to come back

805
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,879
and um you know

806
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,520
i wanna i'm gonna back up take your time

807
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,039
with these getting to know you questions

808
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,080
right be present and engaged as they

809
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,320
speak make it obvious that you're

810
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,720
listening and that you're interested

811
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,919
don't pick your nails don't whatever be

812
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,399
interested be engaged when you feel the

813
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,960
rapport building um

814
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
when you feel like it has gotten to a

815
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,440
decent foundation set

816
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,720
then we're going to start asking the

817
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,679
harder questions

818
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,039
these are just a couple of the questions

819
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,080
to the get to know you typing questions

820
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,960
i i definitely recommend not

821
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,679
you know like don't stick just to this

822
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,080
have your own questions um these are

823
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,559
some good getting to know your questions

824
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,320
but i also think your follow-up

825
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,559
questions should you know if they say oh

826
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,279
i've been here for you know a year oh

827
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,039
what would you do before that where'd

828
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,760
you come from ask some questions keep it

829
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,880
professional keep it work related

830
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,000
we don't need to ask them about their

831
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,559
family life but um but ask those

832
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,080
questions

833
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,279
get to know these people especially if

834
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,200
there's somebody who's gonna be on your

835
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,679
team um that's really gonna give you a

836
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,640
lot

837
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,000
so when you feel like the rapport

838
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,559
building is good and we've we're gonna

839
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,480
start asking the harder questions now

840
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,919
listen no one's going to tell you the

841
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,080
team sucks and oh yeah bob's lazy and

842
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,000
his code sucks this is the part of the

843
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,320
interview where we are watching for the

844
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,760
other person's body language and

845
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,559
expressions not their words

846
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,080
when elliot asked me what the most

847
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,760
important thing to me in a team was it

848
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,279
was easy i told him i wanted to be with

849
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,720
the team that worked as hard as i did

850
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,399
because in my head i had imagined all

851
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,760
the people who i've worked with over the

852
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,320
years that did the bare minimum

853
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,640
and i had to take up their slack

854
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
um but like i mentioned no one's gonna

855
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
tell you that the team members are crazy

856
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,640
or lazy crazy

857
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,960
um when i asked my co-worker about what

858
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,120
he thought of the rest of my team he

859
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,159
didn't hesitate he immediately with like

860
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,320
wide open eyes and instant smile on his

861
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,720
face he said oh they're great

862
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,480
and he said i told you about the people

863
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,000
i worked with at my previous company and

864
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,679
he said honestly they were great we all

865
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,200
worked really well together he said but

866
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,480
these people

867
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,880
i can honestly say that these people are

868
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,000
my friends his body language was open

869
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,320
there was no shift to suggest that

870
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,559
anything he said was not true

871
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,000
and this is a good place to talk a

872
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,360
little bit about body language and what

873
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
we're looking for so we want to make

874
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,440
sure that we're having that we have

875
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
created our rapport as we've listened to

876
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
our interviewer we're also watching

877
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,919
their body behavior we want to be aware

878
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,399
of what their behavior is like when we

879
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,559
know they are telling us the truth or

880
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,200
you know pretty sure they are um then if

881
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,679
we see any deviation we can consider if

882
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,000
this is something that's being held back

883
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,960
or not

884
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,320
odds are a question like how long have

885
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,519
you worked here and other benign

886
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,159
questions are going to elicit truthful

887
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,679
responses okay

888
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,399
um so we want to observe that and we

889
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,640
want to start asking our more probing

890
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,559
questions we look to see if there's a

891
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,200
change we have to consider that there

892
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,039
could be other reasons for deviations

893
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,519
from the baseline behavior um but if we

894
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,919
see no deviation then we can believe

895
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,840
with a fairly good degree of of

896
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
certainty that we're that they're being

897
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,919
completely truthful with us and as far

898
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,720
as my co-worker it was 100 true my team

899
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,000
works amazingly together um they're

900
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,240
super supportive of each other there

901
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,320
aren't any rock stars on our team like

902
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,120
everyone is the rock star um basically i

903
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,799
get to work with the mandiant version of

904
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,559
the beatles and i know that there's

905
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,080
other people who feel that way about

906
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
their teams at mandiant but they're

907
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,200
wrong

908
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,240
um so i asked this series of questions

909
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,039
to everybody um i wanna know what the

910
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,840
work culture is like i wanna know where

911
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,640
life balance is like i wanna know you

912
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
know just anything and everything that's

913
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,399
what i want to know here

914
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,080
like i said it's super important that we

915
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,840
are in a

916
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,159
environment that is going to allow us

917
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,559
to um you know be happy at the end of

918
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,600
the day with what we're doing

919
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,120
all right so like i said this this this

920
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,720
is the point where we're asking our

921
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,120
probing questions and

922
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,918
you know um

923
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,240
and

924
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,320
finding out those answers that maybe

925
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,279
would not be the easiest to give right

926
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,159
so

927
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,639
for example the team i worked for or

928
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,879
that i work for was part of a company

929
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,639
called veridim and they were inquired by

930
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,159
fireeye about six months prior to my

931
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,719
hearing and i wanted to know how that

932
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,960
was going like you know was the mandiant

933
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,560
fight because like mandy and fire i was

934
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,199
my dream employer but i didn't know what

935
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,960
it was like on the inside or how the

936
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,719
former verdant employees were being

937
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,359
treated or how they liked the change i

938
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,719
knew that no one interviewing me who's

939
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,399
essentially representing the company was

940
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,879
gonna be like you know no it's horrible

941
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,760
um but again it was body language that i

942
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,239
was looking for i had worked in a lot of

943
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,079
negative environments in the past and i

944
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,760
was going to avoid that type of

945
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,040
situation

946
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,760
at all costs so luckily for me everyone

947
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,159
had positive experiences and relayed

948
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,800
that to me very well and very genuinely

949
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,560
um but this is the time that we're gonna

950
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,480
ask any of those questions that you

951
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,440
identify during the recon phase

952
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,560
okay

953
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,520
so

954
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
this is the one question

955
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,640
i urge everyone to ask additionally i

956
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,160
always recommend saving this question

957
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,200
for last

958
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,160
and there's psychology behind why i do

959
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,440
that last um and but this question it

960
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,119
does a lot of things in one seemingly

961
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,440
simple question so let's unpack it okay

962
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,760
first it brings the spotlight indirectly

963
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,640
back to us right without being too showy

964
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,359
and too whatever you're not hired yet

965
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,440
and i hope you're not doing that weird

966
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,880
creepy thing or you act like you're

967
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,960
already hired or on a team

968
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,560
there's something to the psychology

969
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,960
behind that but i find this is a better

970
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,280
way to create an image of you working in

971
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,880
this place without being too overt um it

972
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,640
also doesn't use words like if such as

973
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,240
if i started tomorrow what advice would

974
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,720
you give me um i like to stay away from

975
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,599
using words like if when when possible

976
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,359
um because i don't want to leave like

977
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,280
doubts like i have a doubt that they

978
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,520
would hire us right

979
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,599
so instead we ask what advice would you

980
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,760
give a new employee to thrive and be

981
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,440
successful here

982
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,599
this question does so many things it's

983
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,119
obvious that you want to know how to

984
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,280
thrive and be successful it helps the

985
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,800
interviewer visualize you in that

986
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,280
position and best of all they give you

987
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,720
actual advice to be successful it's also

988
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,960
super interesting when you interview the

989
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,359
multiple different people separately

990
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,040
as opposed to like a panel interview to

991
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,560
see the different responses like my

992
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,400
senior manager's response was simply to

993
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,480
be reliable and that showed me what was

994
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,960
important to him i asked the vp that

995
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
interviewed me the same question and his

996
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,560
answer was three-fold and has stayed

997
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,400
with me the part that stayed with me the

998
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,040
most was to give yourself grace

999
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,119
he told me we're going to ask you to do

1000
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,960
things here that no one has ever done

1001
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,040
before so you won't be able to google

1002
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,880
some things or like find it on stack

1003
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,200
overflow right sometimes you have to

1004
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
step back and give yourself grace when

1005
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,079
you are having a difficult time

1006
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,280
this told me way more about my potential

1007
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,839
new employer it told me

1008
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,680
about their work culture and

1009
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,320
expectations it was made perfectly clear

1010
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,760
that some days were going to be very

1011
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,240
hard and fast-paced solar winds

1012
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,480
but it also showed me

1013
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,000
that they looked at their employees as

1014
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,240
individuals and that they valued our

1015
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,520
mental health

1016
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,680
now i've given this advice before many

1017
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,599
times to friends and strangers alike and

1018
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,240
have had really good success rates i

1019
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,920
mean everything i just gave you is

1020
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,839
grounded in science these questions we

1021
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,320
are asking and our turn to interview are

1022
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,680
important

1023
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,760
do not be the person who goes in and

1024
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,839
says i have no questions

1025
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,079
think of at least a couple ha a couple

1026
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,000
beforehand that are specific to your

1027
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,599
environment and your potential new

1028
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,880
employer

1029
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,720
if you can't think of anything that's

1030
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,119
like super important to you feel free to

1031
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,599
reuse the ones i've given you um but

1032
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,920
really figure out what is important to

1033
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,960
you i always recommend keeping this last

1034
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,359
question big as the last question

1035
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,839
because i feel like it really does give

1036
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,720
a heap of information to them about you

1037
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
as well as to you about them in such a

1038
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,079
simple question

1039
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,119
it causes them to visualize you working

1040
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,160
here

1041
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,800
and giving you usually actionable advice

1042
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,480
to be successful

1043
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,640
if that advice is to work like a billion

1044
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,000
hours a week then perhaps they're not

1045
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,240
the company for you right and we need we

1046
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,160
need to know some of these things

1047
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,040
um i've obviously given most posi mostly

1048
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,400
positive outcomes to the potential

1049
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,480
questions um but there are equally

1050
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,000
negative answers that could be given to

1051
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,560
you as well so either way these

1052
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
questions and utilizing the reverse

1053
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,720
interview technique will help you to

1054
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,119
find out if this is a company you want

1055
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,160
to continue to pursue or wipe your brow

1056
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,240
and be like thank you i dodged that

1057
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,560
bullet

1058
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
so thank you guys so much for joining me

1059
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,800
today remember that by taking the time

1060
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,880
to consider what is most important to us

1061
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,920
in a job team or potential new employer

1062
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,079
and crafting those considerations into

1063
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,000
questions to help us establish a rapport

1064
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,440
with our interviewers

1065
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,359
we are not only showing our interviewers

1066
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,800
how much we have to offer in an

1067
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,079
environment

1068
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,480
but we helped crap

1069
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,280
in an environment that we helped craft

1070
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,040
but we're also seeing what those

1071
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,280
responses are and we can best determine

1072
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,440
if this is the right environment for us

1073
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,119
to continue to grow and thrive in our

1074
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,240
careers

1075
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
so you know some people often have asked

1076
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,720
me like what if i'm what if i'm super

1077
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,800
introverted um what if i'm not good at

1078
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,440
small talk you know what if i just can't

1079
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,920
seem to get rid of the nerves and i

1080
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,480
think practicing leading up to the

1081
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,800
actual interview remember that this is

1082
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,000
your time to this is not just your time

1083
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,520
for um you know your interviewers

1084
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,240
to ask you questions this is your time

1085
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,760
this is your time to ask your

1086
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,480
interviewer questions because i look at

1087
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,599
it like

1088
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,640
i

1089
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,200
am important i have things to bring to

1090
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,240
this job

1091
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,119
and

1092
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,680
so i try to remind myself that this is

1093
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,599
not just about them liking me it's about

1094
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,079
me liking them as well we should not be

1095
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,160
looking for jobs and just picking any

1096
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,200
old job

1097
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,760

1098
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
get a job to pay our bills and that you

1099
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,359

1100
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,960
