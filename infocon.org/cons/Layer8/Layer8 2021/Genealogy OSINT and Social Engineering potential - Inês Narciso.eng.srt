1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
my screen

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,440
and

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,960
hopefully

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,879
this will go smoothly

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,840
okay

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,239
so

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,600
what are we talking here today so today

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,920
the topic of this presentation is

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,039
genealogy ozin and social engineering

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,560
potential

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
and we're gonna basically cover three

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,719
points we're going to start to talk

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,680
about

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,239
how genealogy and ozin have so much in

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,360
common despite what you may be thinking

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,320
then we'll go through some tools and

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,200
resources that can help you connect it

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,960
to genealogy that can help you in your

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
ozine investigations

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,039
and then at a third point we're going to

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,480
talk about

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,120
social engineering and the potential of

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
genealogy as a pivot point for social

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,879
engineering

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,239
all through this of course we have to

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,640
acknowledge ethical concerns

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,879
so

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,920
just by everything we're going to show

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,479
you here always do this kind of research

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,119
and investigations considering ethical

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,720
boundaries and respect for others

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,280
so yeah so let's get started and to get

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,520
started i really want to talk a little

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,880
bit about myself and maybe that's kind

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,840
of like

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,600
not very humble

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,479
but it is important because i bet that

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
on the other side there there's a lot of

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,119
you that do ozent and

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,880
maybe you are in a job that you don't

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,439
like that much or you would like to

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,560
broaden your scope and you you don't

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,200
really know what to do with those in but

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,040
actually you can do everything right i

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,280
mean that's the amazing thing about

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
ozin and the connection to genealogy is

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
actually an interesting story because i

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
worked in law enforcement for 12 years

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,240
you know like

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,159
doing research on terrorists and

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,880
organized crime and spies and all those

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
really interesting things but at a

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
certain point i really wanted a change

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,479
and i wanted a little bit better of a

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,000
family life

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
and i actually went to academia and i

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,520
went to study uh in lisbon where i i do

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
some research now

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,239
but

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
for the last two years i've

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,200
kind of started to develop a hobby that

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,560
now is a company in genealogy because i

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
always like kind of look

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,319
love genealogy

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,200
and

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,840
currently i have a company that actually

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
employs 15 people

68
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,120
and that is doing quite well and i want

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,959
to leave this story with you just

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,599
because i want you all to feel that

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,360
despite the fact that maybe you feel

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
that you can't apply it to your job or

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,440
you cannot make of those a living

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,480
despite the normal areas where we

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,560
usually ceos in like journalism

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,200
investigation or like cyber security or

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
law enforcement but there's a lot of

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
things that you can do so that's how

79
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
we're going to start our talk today so

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
about how ozin applies to genealogy

81
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,360
now basically there's three things that

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
genealogy and ozin have in common first

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,959
the type of person that likes genealogy

84
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,360
and ozin are usually very similar in

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,280
terms of the qualities that you need and

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,840
the type of things that you like

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,080
second the type of elements that you

88
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,560
collect doing your collection process is

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,120
also very similar and the entire like

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
cycle in the entire process of

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
collecting and analyzing is also very

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,920
similar

93
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,200
now

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
when we're talking about a person

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,760
what kind of person

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,159
likes um well i'm a member of the aussie

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,680
curious

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
team and i've always felt that it's a

99
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,959
really good word because curiosity

100
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,519
actually usually defines people who are

101
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
kind of addicted to ozone right because

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,159
we can't see something and not go after

103
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,200
it and in genealogy it's quite the same

104
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,040
it's it's just you know you start

105
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,840
wondering like you ask your father like

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,238
why did grandma didn't use like

107
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,478
grandfather's name and then he goes yeah

108
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,080
there was this history about his surname

109
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,400
that had and you just want to know more

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,639
and it's just like something that gets

111
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,960
into your head and you can't take it out

112
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,759
so definitely curiosity is something

113
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,560
that exists in ozin researchers and in

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,360
genealogists as well this this endless

115
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
search for answers

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
then there's another characteristic that

117
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,720
you almost feel that you also need very

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,639
often and believe me you need it in

119
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,000
genealogy as well which is tenacity i

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
mean you need to be persistent you can't

121
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
quit on the first time that you're going

122
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,600
through like no ma i don't know how many

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,960
social media

124
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,039
um platforms and you can't find the

125
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,360
profile of the target you're looking at

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,240
and you just want to give it a quit and

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,960
you just have to keep kind of pushing

128
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,160
and yeah and pursuing and thinking that

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,560
eventually it will pay off because we

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
know that most of the times it will

131
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
and you can also only have results if

132
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,080
you have a third characteristic which is

133
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,039
also very important which is the ability

134
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,680
to step out and see things from a

135
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,639
distance and trying to connect dots that

136
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
apparently at the first side will not

137
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,320
look connected

138
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,639
so this is also something that's really

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,080
important that

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,520
both genealogists and ozin researchers

141
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
will look at something like i have

142
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,479
someone and he's from the military and i

143
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
know that because

144
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
where in a reference to him it says

145
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,360
lieutenant and what does that tell me

146
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,639
that tells me that he was probably

147
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,199
abroad or maybe abroad and maybe his

148
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
name or his data is in some military

149
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
record and you will do this in a normal

150
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,800
investigation you will do it in a

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
genealogical investigation everything's

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,880
about people and how they behave and how

153
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
historical events and how things

154
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,199
happening change lives of people like

155
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,600
there were floods here maybe they moved

156
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,639
and all this thinking about

157
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,800
getting the data that you already have

158
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
and trying to understand it in a bigger

159
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,039
scope of what's happening in that place

160
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,520
and at that time is important both for

161
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,600
ocean researchers as for genealogists

162
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
so if you're this kind

163
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,039
i mean you would probably make a really

164
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,880
good genealogist

165
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,599
and yeah you can always start i started

166
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,240
late so it's never late to start

167
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,080
the second thing that genealogy and

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
knowledge and have in common is the

169
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,759
issue of elements

170
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,479
so in both cases we deal with two types

171
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,960
of elements we deal with identifiable

172
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,560
elements like a name and a birth date

173
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
for example or an address a very

174
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,479
specific address

175
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,880
these are like types of data that will

176
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,520
be very much singular about that person

177
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
or a very small group of people and

178
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,919
usually when you have that i mean you

179
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,639
may have one or two false positives but

180
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,919
usually it's

181
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
a very identifiable lead right

182
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,039
but very often people don't

183
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,680
underestimate and they do this in ozen

184
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,919
as they do in genealogy they will

185
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,800
underestimate contextual data and

186
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
contextual data can be like the fact

187
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,520
that that person was in the military or

188
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
the fact that they're still single when

189
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,919
they're like 50 for example maybe they

190
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,639
were a priest or for example if you're

191
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,919
looking at at a http header of an email

192
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
it may be like the browser the person's

193
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,879
using or their operating system or their

194
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,759
time zone so sometimes we're focusing on

195
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,720
the email or the ip but we also have all

196
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,280
this contextual data that we need to

197
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,199
take into account when we're doing our

198
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,000
analysis and usually the best

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
researchers will make the best use of

200
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,440
combining both so they will not only

201
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,240
focus on that very specific email or

202
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,039
that very specific name or a birthdate

203
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,520
but they will also look at okay if the

204
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,599
person sending me the email from this

205
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
time zone what does that mean for

206
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,319
example what what what what's off here

207
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,958
what's not like actually

208
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,559
getting the dots together so how can i

209
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
analyze this and think

210
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,799
what what information here leads me to

211
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,719
different conclusions than the ones that

212
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
if i just look to identifiable data that

213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
that i will have

214
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,120
and finally there is a very similar

215
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,519
process i mean i'm sure you're all very

216
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,720
familiar with the intelligence cycle and

217
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,279
it it's something that sometimes we we

218
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
kind of tend to forget because we're

219
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,760
like doing our work every day but it's

220
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
never a bad idea to step back and look

221
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,120
at a researcher doing our investigation

222
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,760
and identify each phase and understand

223
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
what you did in each phase and which

224
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
ones you didn't devote too much

225
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
attention or forgot or jumped through

226
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
and very often you will find small

227
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,519
mistakes that could have led to a better

228
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,680
like resolution of the case

229
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,480
now

230
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
when we're planning an ozin

231
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
investigation or when we're planning a

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,399
genealogical investigation we need

233
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,800
planning and direction planning means

234
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
that we know how much

235
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,440
much money we have so like imagine you

236
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
have a really big budget you can go

237
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,640
crazy or you have just yourself for a

238
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,839
couple of weeks or hours

239
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,480
um

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,440
and how far does the customer or the

241
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
person that ask you for this research

242
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,440
wants to go like how much they want to

243
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,320
invest and how far do they want to go do

244
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
they want to know like the cousin of the

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,160
cousin of the cousin or the case if

246
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,880
you're doing like a veto process for a

247
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,920
possible

248
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,800
uh new employee do they want to go like

249
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
all the way back to teenage years of

250
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,720
that employee or they just want to know

251
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
if they have like a recent criminal

252
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,440
record so like in both cases we need to

253
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,839
know exactly where the boundaries are in

254
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
terms of time and how much resources

255
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
we're spending now another important

256
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,480
thing is

257
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,120
another important thing is

258
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,600
that we really need to think also about

259
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,680
how we communicate with the person

260
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
that's making the request

261
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,200
so

262
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
very often in ozent and you all have

263
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,720
this and i have this now in genealogy

264
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
exactly the same we will have someone

265
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
that will ask us for something but not

266
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,959
give us everything they have so they

267
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,800
will go like i really would like you to

268
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,440
have a look in this other company that's

269
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,800
owned by john stewart blah blah blah

270
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,959
and they will give you like a name and a

271
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,880
phone or something to start with in the

272
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,440
name of the company and then suddenly

273
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,000
like three emails later or into a phone

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
conversation you find out that actually

275
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
the person that did the request knew

276
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,600
that john

277
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
always went to on holidays to the

278
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
bahamas or

279
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
this will happen with genealogy as well

280
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,680
so so clients will give us their their

281
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
birth certificates or their grandparents

282
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,920
birth certificates and they think that's

283
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
enough and they will forget to say for

284
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,839
example that their grandfather was a

285
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
doctor or that for example they had an

286
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,480
uncle that went to live in india so all

287
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
these details are really important and

288
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
when we communicate with the person

289
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,920
that's doing the request it's really

290
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,640
important that everything that they pass

291
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
everything that they have and that we

292
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
keep asking them more questions to be

293
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,800
sure that this has happened

294
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,839
now the second stage is about collection

295
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,800
and

296
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,399
collection is

297
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
so important and that's why it's so

298
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,839
important to start with all the

299
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,160
contextual data that you have besides

300
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,639
the identifiable data

301
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,200
and here once again a good genealogist a

302
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,680
good ozin researcher will stand out just

303
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,120
because he will think a lot about where

304
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,279
he will collect things as you will see

305
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,680
today during the presentation like in

306
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,079
genealogy just like in ozen it's not

307
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,160
like you have one website where you can

308
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,839
just search for everything i mean

309
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,800
there's google okay but there isn't like

310
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,720
a one solution there's a lot of

311
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,200
scattered data things are all over the

312
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
place and you need to really think about

313
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,959
where you're going to search because

314
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,720
that process is almost as important as

315
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,560
the search itself

316
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,519
so for example i need to think which

317
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,360
country which location military records

318
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,800
university records old newspapers land

319
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,959
for example properties where am i

320
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,040
searching there's no point of searching

321
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
for someone who's like a doctor for

322
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,279
example a lot for land registrations

323
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,200
because maybe they didn't have any but

324
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,959
looking at universities may be super

325
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,800
relevant because for sure they took

326
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,959
their degree somewhere where was this in

327
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,600
which university where was he born where

328
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
did he start practicing what's the

329
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,519
closest university do they have an

330
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,160
online database so all these questions

331
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,399
are really important at that stage and

332
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
of course we have processing and

333
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,040
exploitation very often we have like

334
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
bulks of data and we need to filter that

335
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
and we need to organize it and

336
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,800
understand what's important and what's

337
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,399
not that important

338
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,920
and when we're doing the analysis

339
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
when we're doing the analysis it's also

340
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,560
so important that

341
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
we understand the value of the evidence

342
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,800
and this is really important in

343
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,639
intelligence and when you're doing an

344
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,920
ocean report especially for when it's it

345
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
has implications so you're doing like

346
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
vetting of an employee that may not get

347
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,079
hired because of that and there's a

348
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,839
difference between

349
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,720
having an idea that something's off from

350
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,800
having evidence that something's off and

351
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,440
with genealogy it's the same very often

352
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,160
we will have strong evidence that for

353
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,839
example this person jon stewart is the

354
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,519
son of paul stewart and

355
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,079
martha but we will have this because for

356
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,560
example paul was the godfather of his

357
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,040
children's baptisms and because they

358
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,800
were living in the same address in a

359
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,480
census that was done in 80 40 whatever

360
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,160
and they have the same name and they're

361
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
the only ones with that last name

362
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,399
surname in that village but that doesn't

363
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,240
mean we're absolutely right and it's

364
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
really important when we write a report

365
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
and when we pass it on that we very

366
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,760
explicitly say what our is our degree of

367
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,839
certainty and what does the evidence

368
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,320
tells us and with ozin it's exactly the

369
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,040
same so i believe that this social media

370
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,600
profile belongs to this target because

371
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,079
of a b c and d but there's no way that i

372
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,240
can be sure for example because there's

373
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
no profile picture or because i don't

374
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
have the targets picture

375
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,560
so all these things are really important

376
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,360
of course dissemination you in our case

377
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,199
for example in our company we always

378
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,440
deliver the report to the client that

379
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
then goes through it with a lot of joy i

380
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,240
like to think to see like what's his

381
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,040
background and what like what are their

382
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,480
roots and you know not in our day to day

383
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,639
ozin we will do it with a purpose for

384
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,959
for example a client or law enforcement

385
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,720
or a for example journalistic

386
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,399
investigation

387
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,959
now now that we've kind of seen what

388
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,360
they have in common you probably

389
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,279
understand much better

390
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,160
how did i went from going after

391
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,079
terrorists to

392
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,440
going after grandparents and

393
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,399
great-great-grandparents of people

394
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,120
because the the thought process and and

395
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,519
my personality and what i like and

396
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,560
everything i use in everyday life is

397
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,800
more or less the same it's just the

398
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,120
places where i collect things that

399
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,199
actually change

400
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,320
now

401
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
when we're talking about sources so

402
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,720
where do you collect the data where do

403
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,880
where do can you get data

404
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,240
we're talking about a myriad of sources

405
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
so

406
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,440
i think for social media platforms there

407
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,240
is more or less a monopoly but for

408
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
genealog genealogical sources there's

409
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,680
like

410
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,639
it's completely scattered and it has one

411
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,959
characteristic which is

412
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,759
sometimes frustrating which is it's very

413
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,079
national so usually like historical

414
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,880
archives and everything that has to do

415
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
with birth certificates or land

416
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,199
registries are very connected to a

417
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,920
country for example okay so in this

418
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,279
presentation

419
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,720
i'm not going to go through like a

420
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,680
hundred tools from brazil to spain to

421
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,440
the netherlands to the us because it

422
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,519
would just be too much we're going to

423
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,199
focus in especially three or four types

424
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,519
of tools that are really important and

425
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,440
one in specific that's very good and

426
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,039
that's free

427
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,439
that has worldwide records

428
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,679
that takes about five minutes to create

429
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,079
an account so you can all like at the

430
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,400
end of this day or in the weekend have

431
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
fun create an account you just need an

432
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,199
email it can be like any email

433
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,520
and you will have access to billions of

434
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,319
documents public records photos and

435
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,280
books and that tools family search

436
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,799
family search is kind of like the

437
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
facebook for genealogy

438
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,120
so it's probably the biggest tool and

439
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,080
the one that has more data in it

440
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
but i would still tell you that there

441
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,240
are some tools similar to family search

442
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,520
like my heritage or ancestry.com that

443
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,160
also have really relevant information

444
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,080
but they are not free

445
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,640
now one of the things that

446
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
you should remember when you're doing in

447
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,200
this case ozent is

448
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,640
myheritage and ancestry.com for example

449
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,799
are platforms where you have

450
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,000
uh

451
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,240
living people so sometimes people will

452
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,080
create their family profiles and they

453
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,720
will have the public so this is really

454
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,799
interesting from an ozone standard view

455
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,960
standpoint i didn't bring it here today

456
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,520
because since it's not a free tool it

457
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,960
would just you know create all these

458
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
expectations and then you can use it so

459
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,280
we're going to focus on what's free but

460
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
i did wanted to warn you that for

461
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,919
example my heritage is really worth a

462
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,400
look especially if you're looking at the

463
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
person the target himself or his parents

464
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,480
or like the first generation right

465
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,440
so

466
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
once you create an account on on family

467
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,240
search this will be like the main

468
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,000
entrance view now here when what you

469
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,200
have is a lot of options but we're going

470
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,840
to focus especially on one of the topics

471
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,960
here on the top which is search right

472
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,880
now search allows us to go through

473
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,559
records images family tree genealogies

474
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,679
catalog

475
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,080
books and research wiki

476
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,640
now today we're going to look at records

477
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,559
and images only

478
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,120
but if you do go through this in the

479
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,840
weekend go through for example the books

480
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,760
section because it has

481
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,280
loads of books

482
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,919
more than google books has for example

483
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,559
or havi trust which is another online

484
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,200
book platform that we use a lot both

485
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,760
google books and heavy trust allow for

486
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,240
textual search so if you have the

487
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
grandparent for example of someone and

488
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
you want to search for them or the for

489
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,960
the parent for example you can do it on

490
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
google books you can do it on hadley

491
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
trust and you can do it here on the

492
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,440
books platform or family search because

493
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,280
if there's a book about the family where

494
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
they speak about like how many children

495
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,640
they have where did they live everything

496
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,080
and so on

497
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
sometimes it has what they did for a

498
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,960
living it will probably be here on the

499
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,200
family search books option which allows

500
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
for textual search as well and very

501
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,840
often lets you read some of the text

502
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,640
right

503
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
the catalog allows you to search for

504
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,280
location for example and see if you're

505
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,159
looking at birth certificates in

506
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,799
let's imagine barcelona spain you can go

507
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,840
to the catalog and just see the last

508
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,080
years of birth certificates in barcelona

509
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,559
spain they don't have everything in the

510
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,440
world

511
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,080
but usually they will have more than

512
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,480
anyone else so it's and it's free so

513
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,200
it's always worth to have a look right

514
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,320
now

515
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,400
the two things that we will have today a

516
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,799
better look is records and images now

517
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,039
records is especially interesting why

518
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,280
because

519
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,159
the family search team has devoted a lot

520
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,360
of time

521
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,120
and a lot of money in indexing a lot of

522
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,840
these of these registrations so instead

523
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,000
of going to barcelona spain because you

524
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,919
know that your parent your target's

525
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,520
parents for example were born there and

526
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,559
just going through images after images

527
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,520
if it's indexed if it's if it's been

528
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,760
seen through the family search team you

529
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,039
can actually search for their names okay

530
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,600
and for the location and you have a lot

531
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,440
of options here as you can see that you

532
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,159
can add on so let's imagine that you

533
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,559
have for example a target and you know

534
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
that his mom is martha but you don't

535
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,120
know her last name and you know his

536
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
father is paul stewart and he's john

537
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,280
stewart so probably about john there's

538
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
no records because it's still something

539
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
like very recent but you can always

540
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
search for example for paul stewart with

541
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,799
the spouse martha living in barcelona

542
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,320
spain for example

543
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
so these are the kind of boolean

544
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
searches that we're all used to do and

545
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,480
when we do our ozine work and that you

546
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,400
can also use this

547
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,679
now what kind of results do we get now

548
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,120
family search has due because it's it's

549
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,840
free and and because of privacy issues

550
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
and very well they don't have

551
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
or they try not to have data on living

552
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,000
people okay so that means you won't find

553
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
like the target's birth certificate but

554
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
if their parents or their grandparents

555
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,440
for example have died you may find for

556
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,679
example their death certificate and

557
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,280
usually it states for example their

558
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
children and their spouses of their

559
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,159
children and sometimes it has even has

560
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,440
more data

561
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,320
it always also has people that were born

562
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
a long time ago and that the platform

563
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,640
assumes are no longer living so birth

564
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
certificates and all of that right

565
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,799
now here what i did was basically i took

566
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,200
rhode island which is where i wish we

567
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,039
would all be right now but we can

568
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,559
because of the pandemic

569
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,440
and i took the last name narcisso which

570
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,520
is my last name and i just went to

571
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,120
search okay let's see if i have like

572
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,600
family members over there so this is

573
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,000
there's a lot of results it it ended up

574
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,919
giving like two thousand three thousand

575
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,159
well a lot but i just did a screenshot

576
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,000
so that you can have an idea of what

577
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,559
kind of documents you will drop now some

578
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,960
of them are in image forms some of them

579
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,039
will just have the data but then you

580
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,039
will have ideas like siblings for

581
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,039
example as you can see here you will

582
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,679
have name of the father of the mother of

583
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,720
the spouse of the children and you get a

584
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,039
lot of information now what kind of

585
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,440
information do you get here for example

586
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,919
here we have a census of this family and

587
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,240
you will have like they were all living

588
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,799
together for example and you will have

589
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,240
the idea of the children of their age

590
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,480
and you will start to have a timeline so

591
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,919
if you're looking at a person for

592
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,240
example and you want to understand her

593
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
their personality their profiling and

594
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,400
you understand that for example

595
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,080
his father or his mother were one of a

596
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
family of 10 siblings in which they were

597
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,960
all super click close together and they

598
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,279
lived together until very long that

599
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,279
allows you to have an idea of this

600
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,600
family support system for example now

601
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
these are small details but when you add

602
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,360
them all together as we will see in the

603
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,279
end of this presentation you will have a

604
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,320
lot of data to work on

605
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
then you will have things like this so

606
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,039
this is in portuguese but this is a

607
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,559
death certificate actually from 2012 i

608
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,840
think uh yeah 2012. so about someone

609
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,600
that was born in 1951 it states the

610
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840
the reason of that they died their

611
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,120
address it states their um

612
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,840
spouse and their children for example

613
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,720
here in the end it says observations

614
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
she was married with she leaves blah

615
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,600
blah blah children and it even has

616
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,440
the documents so as you can see here in

617
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
the end it will have their social

618
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,320
security number their tax revenue number

619
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,720
and all of that information

620
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
just right there you know just by

621
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
searching for the name for example in

622
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
this case

623
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,960
so this gives you also a good idea of

624
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,039
what kind of data we can find in these

625
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,039
types of platforms

626
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
another thing that you also should have

627
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,960
a look at is images so besides records

628
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,240
there's the images are geo-located now

629
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
here we have an example of a place in

630
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,960
the coast of ireland for example where i

631
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,760
just put the map over it and you can see

632
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,559
all the register all the databases that

633
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,360
family search has for this area so here

634
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,600
for example we have school records but

635
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
it also may be like graveyard

636
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,919
immigration cards

637
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,799
birth certificates land properties

638
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,400
uh wills a lot of documents about that

639
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,279
area

640
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,360
so if you're looking at someone that's

641
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,080
from a specific area or for example if

642
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,919
you're interested in a place in

643
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,080
particular because you're looking at for

644
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,880
example recruitment opportunities in a

645
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
hostile country this may be a really

646
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,760
cool place to start and understand like

647
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,559
how are the networks between families

648
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,400
how do they live

649
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
and you have a lot of information here

650
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,120
also

651
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,799
now memories now memories works a little

652
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,480
bit like

653
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
um

654
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
yeah like facebook like a social media

655
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,440
platform so

656
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,200
just like you created a

657
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,960
profile on family search everyone

658
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
creates a profile right then you have

659
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,039
like different privacy settings and you

660
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,360
can create your own data and put your

661
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
parents on it and

662
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,320
up to everyone that's living it will not

663
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,400
share that data to with other users

664
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,720
unless you state otherwise so you can

665
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,120
put your parents at ease for example if

666
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,799
they're still living they won't be shown

667
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,720
to other users but from the moment that

668
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,480
you start handling with people that have

669
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,400
deceased it will share that data with

670
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
other users it's kind of like a

671
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,400
wikipedia of genealogy right

672
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,480
and one of the things that it allows you

673
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,520
is to

674
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,120
put

675
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,720
memories and things attached for example

676
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,679
to your grandparents profile so for

677
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,279
example if i would create my

678
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,919
grandfather's profile i would probably

679
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:58,880
put

680
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,320
an award that he received for example

681
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,880
because of the work he did on world war

682
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,799
ii so

683
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,640
that kind of thing that you're proud of

684
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,960
people will put in their memories kind

685
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,240
of folder and that's open and public and

686
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
one of the things that family search

687
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,880
allows is for you to search by keywords

688
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,039
so here for example i just search for my

689
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
last name narciso and you get like

690
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,640
thousands of results and you can of

691
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,880
course filter this with other keywords

692
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,039
but as you can see for example you have

693
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,279
grades you have pictures and you even

694
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,000
have like a best certificate so a lot of

695
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,600
people will put like documentation into

696
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,559
um

697
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,840
into the

698
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,080
into the platform and it will be visible

699
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,200
to others

700
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
you can also search for example for a

701
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,840
location so imagine there's a really

702
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,000
hostile location that you really need to

703
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,159
spend some time to to do some research

704
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,320
like on the ground on the field

705
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,840
and you really want to know more about

706
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,919
the history of the location or as you

707
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,679
will see further ahead if you need a

708
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,559
cover story so you can have a lot of

709
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,559
content about that location like what's

710
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,399
happened in the past was there like a

711
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,679
big fire

712
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,679
was there like a flood

713
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,200
was the leader of the city hall actually

714
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,640
arrested because he was i don't know

715
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,799
smuggling alcohol

716
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,960
something like that will pop up in these

717
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
kinds of researches so this is also

718
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,279
really useful to search for locations

719
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,320
now finally and i would tell you that my

720
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,200
heritage and other paid genealogical

721
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,440
platforms are also really interesting to

722
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,960
do this

723
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,039
people will create profiles of the

724
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,000
people of their family and it will

725
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,720
happen and it isn't that

726
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,440
uncommon as you would think if you have

727
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,480
someone someone a target for example

728
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,760
that has an uncommon family name or you

729
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,480
know their ancestors for example and you

730
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,520
search for them on family search so if

731
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,640
you search

732
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,159
you go to find

733
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,159
discover your deceased ancestors and you

734
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,399
search for them and they have a profile

735
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,960
like this gentleman one of the things

736
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,760
that will will be possible is for you to

737
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,399
see for example the person that edited

738
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,120
and put this data into it

739
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,360
so imagine you were interested for

740
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,240
example in this gentleman amadeo so you

741
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,360
know that this lady amanda she put most

742
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,919
of the data into it so she's probably

743
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,240
somehow related to him or she's doing

744
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,559
research about this family

745
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,279
and is as you can see here on the right

746
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,840
you can also usually see the email of

747
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,039
the person that actually put the data on

748
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,320
and as i will talk on later

749
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,360
explaining the the bridges that

750
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,320
genealogy has with social engineering

751
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,880
this is one of those topics where people

752
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,760
always answer and they always talk and

753
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,640
they always share and it's quite amazing

754
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,679
for me as a former intelligence officer

755
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,559
to see how this is actually

756
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,760
so much more effective than probably all

757
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,240
the techniques i used in the past like

758
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
the weather or

759
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
something else that would pop up in that

760
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,360
moment so amanda here created this

761
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
profile or at least she put a lot of the

762
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,520
information into it and we could

763
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,760
probably reach out to her and say what

764
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,919
did you find out about amadeo he's also

765
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,240
from my family i'm really interested in

766
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,080
sharing information where you're from

767
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
etc etc

768
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,159
so this is really interesting and if you

769
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,000
do go to myheritage you will have

770
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,320
exactly the same data for example about

771
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,799
the person who created a family tree and

772
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,640
you can also connect with them and they

773
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,919
will also have like a profile

774
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,919
so yeah so this is a really good

775
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,919
starting point as well even if it's not

776
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,080
your target maybe they're related they

777
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
will know him somehow and they can give

778
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,519
you insights about the family

779
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,279
another really really really relevant

780
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,440
area is newspapers

781
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,679
i'm showing google news here not because

782
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,519
it's like the best and it has a lot

783
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,039
because it doesn't

784
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,120
but because it's so scattered and it's

785
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,000
depends on country to country brazil

786
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,159
which is a country that i work a lot has

787
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,799
a free database that allows for textual

788
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,000
search for from i think 99 of published

789
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,320
newspapers since the 19th century and

790
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,880
it's completely amazing because you will

791
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,720
write down a name and it will just give

792
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,519
you like the obituary the businesses

793
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,760
that they have the

794
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,720
the court appearance that they went to

795
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,480
like all of those things that will

796
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,399
usually happen and

797
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,320
appear on newspapers sometimes really

798
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,799
sad stories about murders and violence

799
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,760
they will all come up right so google

800
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,080
news is a good starting point but i

801
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,200
would always advise you to depending on

802
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,559
the place that you're doing your

803
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,440
research on the country and the location

804
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,760
just go on to google i mean i'm sure you

805
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,919
all being in an ozin conference know how

806
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,760
to do that just look for like digital

807
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,399
newspapers rhode island or digital

808
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,279
newspapers spain or digital newspapers

809
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,960
netherlands just go search for the

810
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
databases and you will probably find

811
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,840
them and many of them are searchable for

812
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,080
text and that's really a really useful

813
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,159
tool because very often you will get

814
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,840
data from like 1980 1990 and you will

815
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,679
have data for example even about the

816
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,200
birth of your target for example

817
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,919
then we have forums and when i say

818
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,000
forums i want you to think about

819
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,399
facebook groups i want you to think

820
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,440
about whatsapp telegram groups

821
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,080
and basically all online communities

822
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,240
surrounding a certain place and a

823
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,120
certain survey and this is very often so

824
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,880
when you have a target that has a very

825
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,960
specific surname or is from a specific

826
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
location

827
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,880
never forget to go search for groups or

828
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,919
forums or facebook groups or or telegram

829
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,200
groups or

830
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,120
whatever is more relevant in terms of

831
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,840
social media in your area about that

832
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,960
city or about that surname so if we're

833
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,600
talking about for example uh

834
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,000
providence rhode island you would search

835
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,799
for genealogy groups about providence

836
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,279
rhode island or if we're talking about a

837
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,600
last name like narciso you could ask

838
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,279
look for forums where there would be

839
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,000
like threads about the narciso surname

840
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,399
now you would be surprised once again

841
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,320
in these kinds of groups how much

842
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
information people will give to each

843
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,799
other because it's a very like deals in

844
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,919
community very much built into sharing

845
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,000
and trying to help each other into

846
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,480
getting knowledge through so if you go

847
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,519
into a genealogy providence facebook

848
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,919
group and you ask about a certain family

849
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,399
you will probably get 10 times more than

850
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,240
you would if you would just you know go

851
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,960
to

852
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
you know the bowling group that they're

853
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,039
in or something else so this is really

854
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,360
interesting because people will share a

855
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,120
lot of their family history and they

856
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,360
will share a lot about their contact

857
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,159
details so here as a picture i just put

858
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,159
like someone just giving an email to

859
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,639
another user and when i say email we

860
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,879
have a lot with phone numbers as well so

861
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,560
people will say okay just what's

862
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,760
happening or just text me or or facetime

863
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,599
me this is my number

864
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,199
and

865
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,359
very often their own profile like in

866
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,599
this case this user is has a username

867
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,520
ccp will have also more data will have

868
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,599
their date of birth and will have all

869
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,040
the threads in which they wrote

870
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,199
something on so that you can do this

871
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,679
also on facebook you can use this do try

872
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,760
this in a whatsapp group or a telegram

873
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,000
group just try to see what the user has

874
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
written about and usually it will give

875
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,159
you give you a really cool idea about

876
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,639
their family history and about what he's

877
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,119
searching

878
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,719
so

879
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,960
these would be like

880
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,880
in general my suggestions but these as i

881
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,800
showed you the image of the pyramid just

882
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
right in the beginning are the tip of

883
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,200
the iceberg right so if you do want

884
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,040
search more and if you do want to do

885
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
some ozen investigation

886
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,440
go to cindy's list this is a really cool

887
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,680
resource it's like our start me pages

888
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,000
she basically i'm assuming it's a she

889
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,920
because it's called cindy's list but

890
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
well it basically has

891
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
most i would say like 90

892
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,240
of genealogy links organized by theme by

893
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
topic by kind of data they will give you

894
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,000
like jewish genealogy military genealogy

895
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,560
genealogy of the former

896
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,200
caribbean for example

897
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,040
genealogy on slave societies all of that

898
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,599
will be very neatly organized and you

899
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,520
will have a lot of starting points for

900
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,720
your research there

901
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,760
now as we're kind of like wrapping up

902
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,720
we're going to the core issue here and i

903
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,119
and to the thing that i want you to kind

904
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,920
of take with you of the potential

905
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,240
actually that all of this that you that

906
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
i just talked about and that kind of now

907
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,079
seems okay i'm not sure i'm going to use

908
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,560
that in my day-to-day you will because i

909
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,000
will explain you why okay and why is

910
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,680
this so important

911
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,119
well

912
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,160
basically it's useful to do

913
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,839
five things

914
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,400
which basically all kind of

915
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,680
come from social engineering base okay

916
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,079
you will know more about a target you

917
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,320
can justify things you can do

918
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,440
elicitation in a much more grounded way

919
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,920
it makes approach so much easier and

920
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,760
it's one of the best starting points for

921
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,640
a human recruitment operation

922
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,720
what about knowing what can you know

923
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,760
more well let's imagine for example that

924
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,599
i am the target right so we don't want

925
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,480
to like

926
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
give a real example because people may

927
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,359
be angry at me okay and let's imagine

928
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,760
you're doing research on me because i've

929
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,839
kind of decided that i'm an extreme

930
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,880
right kind of really radical

931
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,160
uh person that really would like hitler

932
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,520
to re come back from the dead and regain

933
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,720
power right and i'm have this swastika

934
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
tattoo and you're really working in law

935
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,560
enforcement and you're really concerned

936
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,680
about me and you have like my cv right

937
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,920
you have my cv you know that i was born

938
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,480
in rhode island just like you saw

939
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
the the examples that i gave you and

940
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
this is your starting point right i mean

941
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,200
what could you find for example through

942
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
genealogy platforms first of all you

943
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,880
could find that for example there are

944
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,040
not a lot of narcisos in rhode island

945
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,480
probably there's like

946
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,880
from portuguese descent there's probably

947
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,000
like eight maybe 10 maybe 20. so this

948
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,079
would make your life easier right and

949
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,400
very easily you would probably find some

950
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,800
possible relatives like my grandfather

951
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,119
for example or someone that you knew

952
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,520
that was probably related right

953
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,119
and

954
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,040
imagine you find the obituary for

955
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,760
example and in the obituary is my name

956
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,839
for example because this is very common

957
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,680
that like in the obituary like the

958
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,200
grandchildren will

959
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,599
say like have their name on it just like

960
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,880
their children

961
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,720
you would also find for example that the

962
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,640
person that created my grandfather's

963
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,040
profile for example would be like a

964
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,640
distant aunt like a sister of his or

965
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
something like that and that she would

966
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,480
have her email so that would be like a

967
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,160
good starting point as well

968
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,640
imagine from that email that you go and

969
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,400
you go run it through facebook and you

970
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,800
understand that that lady that on a mine

971
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,880
has a facebook profile so maybe you

972
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,640
haven't found my social media profile

973
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,480
because it doesn't have my name and

974
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,240
because i'm using some sign of sock of

975
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
it but because you found my ants and my

976
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,520
aunt has like a really open profile

977
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,680
suddenly you have my profile because you

978
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,839
just go through the messages and i say

979
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,800
it's a picture and you look so nice okay

980
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,640
and this is very often that we can't

981
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,359
can't find a social media person's

982
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,119
profile and we forget to think about

983
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,200
their relatives what it what if i knew

984
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
like their their aunt's name their

985
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
cousin's name maybe they're easier to

986
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,640
find maybe like that i could pivot and

987
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,119
find their social media profile profile

988
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,040
so in these kinds of things

989
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
family search and other genealogical

990
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,680
platforms can be really useful

991
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,280
now

992
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
now you have like my facebook profile

993
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,880
right and this is really cool because

994
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,720
you have a starting point and you find

995
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,640
something new and you have like a

996
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,480
timeline you understand that i was born

997
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,079
in rhode island but actually that my

998
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,640
entire family came from portugal and

999
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,880
that they came when i was like

1000
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,440
after i was born like right after they

1001
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,599
came so that actually like my entire

1002
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,160
family comes from portugal

1003
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,200
so

1004
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,440
the next point that you want to do is

1005
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,920
you want to go to my

1006
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
hometown or you want to go and start

1007
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,599
asking questions in the group

1008
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,599
facebook group or the facebook groups

1009
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,640
related or the instagram accounts

1010
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,680
related to me somehow like from family

1011
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,400
members or maybe from the business that

1012
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,240
i was whatever

1013
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,040
so

1014
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
let's imagine you find out that my

1015
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,960
family used to own a restaurant right

1016
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,640
and now it's closed

1017
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,200
now what can you do you can like go to

1018
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,119
the restaurant go to that place where it

1019
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,599
was on the street you can take pictures

1020
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,079
when you have all this backstrong story

1021
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,599
about something that happened like in

1022
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,920
the 90s and in the 80s that people will

1023
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
not relate to like any criminal

1024
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,560
activities that i am connected today you

1025
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,520
can go knock on doors and just go and do

1026
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,560
your reconnaissance or imagine you go to

1027
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,640
join a facebook group and you need to

1028
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,960
say why you're joining i'm a journalist

1029
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,720
i'm a researcher i'm doing about

1030
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,960
portuguese cuisine in providence rhode

1031
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,359
island in the 90s and i'm interested why

1032
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,839
did these restaurants went bankrupt what

1033
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,160
happened was their economic prices what

1034
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,640
families were running them why did it go

1035
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
wrong can you help me

1036
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,480
and these kinds of things will open so

1037
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,400
many doors and will help you so much

1038
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,640
making the right questions we're having

1039
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,520
a good cover story and making everything

1040
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,560
plausible so it makes you easy to make

1041
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,000
makes it easier for you to make the

1042
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,640
right questions to be in the right place

1043
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,359
with a good justification for that right

1044
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,680
you can even ask documents for example

1045
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,319
if you're interesting

1046
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,200
now

1047
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,520
next you're going to the street where i

1048
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,920
used to live and

1049
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,560
or you're in the facebook group of the

1050
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,560
small town i used to live and you want

1051
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,359
to start asking some questions right

1052
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,200
i mean i was saying in the beginning

1053
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,640
this is something that's so much better

1054
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,560
than weather and anything else that you

1055
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,240
can probably imagine to unblock

1056
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,640
conversations especially with old people

1057
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,280
who have an amazing memory and that will

1058
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,560
tell you so much about

1059
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,040
what my family was what happened to my

1060
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,280
family my father was really actually

1061
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,480
very angry he was very violent and

1062
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,720
that's why the restaurant went bankrupt

1063
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,040
because he was not nice to customers and

1064
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,440
people just stopped showing and all of

1065
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,200
that kind of helps you to create a

1066
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,680
profile she goes on vacation to this

1067
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,480
place actually she's had friends and

1068
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,880
people will start talking about it but

1069
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
because you're interested in the past

1070
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,560
they will talk you to you about the

1071
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,400
present without feeling guilty because

1072
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,000
you're not asking about the present

1073
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,480
you're asking about the past but people

1074
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,040
will use stories of the present to

1075
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
understand and explain to you about the

1076
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,000
past so that's why now she's going rogue

1077
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,920
and she's with all those nazis because

1078
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,680
her father was so violent right

1079
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,800
now

1080
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,560
another thing is

1081
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,800
it not only allows you to do elicitation

1082
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,560
but it actually allows you to do

1083
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,800
approaches to the object and his

1084
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,720
immediate surroundings so you could

1085
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,480
actually approach the odds that you got

1086
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,800
the email from family search for example

1087
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,880
and say i'm doing some research about

1088
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
this family can you help me do you have

1089
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,599
any old documents and you can talk if

1090
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,240
with the object eventually like with

1091
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,480
some cover story because you're doing

1092
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,400
like you're interested in trying to

1093
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,800
build write a book about the family or

1094
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,400
you're interested about this issue of

1095
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,359
the restaurants that went bankrupt so it

1096
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,680
makes it really easy to start an

1097
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,000
approach and people will be very keen

1098
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,480
and you can you can try it if you're

1099
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,200
doubting me but you can try it and if

1100
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,599
you have the family tree really well

1101
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,839
built you can even have a good cover

1102
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,480
story about you yourself being like a

1103
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
distant cousin because you will know

1104
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,560
that there was like this sister that

1105
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,119
just went back to portugal or that went

1106
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,760
live in brazil or in the azores or

1107
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
somewhere else that lost connection to

1108
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
the family and you just go i am the

1109
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,599
grandson of that lady and everyone

1110
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,839
remembers her and you have your cover

1111
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,240
story built

1112
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,920
now finally

1113
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,560
as you would probably start doing

1114
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,440
kind of like more research and you would

1115
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,000
approach people from my surroundings

1116
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,319
eventually myself

1117
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,119
you would probably found find out that

1118
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,400
actually

1119
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,680
my father

1120
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,200
went to rhode island to the us in 74

1121
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,359
because there was a revolution in

1122
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,880
portugal that threw away the

1123
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,359
dictatorship and he was very

1124
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,520
pro-fascist and connected to the

1125
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,839
dictatorship and because he was scared

1126
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,839
of being

1127
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,720
yeah prosecuted for that that actually

1128
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,359
he took the entire family to the u.s for

1129
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,119
example right and that i was raised in a

1130
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,200
house where probably

1131
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,520
mussolini and all those very nice

1132
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,359
figures would be

1133
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,000
talked about every day and how

1134
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,800
everything was ruined with democracy for

1135
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,040
example for my family because they lost

1136
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,960
all their lands and all their

1137
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,839
possessions

1138
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,480
now

1139
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
maybe you will also find out through

1140
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
family search that my father for example

1141
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,079
recently died so this could have been

1142
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,720
like the trigger events that led me into

1143
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,359
becoming even more radicalized

1144
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,400
i'm saying this as an example because as

1145
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,560
you build for example a recruitment for

1146
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,200
a human operation these are all things

1147
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,160
that are

1148
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,599
so important

1149
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,280
so that you understand the person's

1150
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,680
motivations and how you can approach

1151
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,079
them and how you can convince them to

1152
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,560
cooperate with you and if any of you out

1153
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,400
there are for example intelligence

1154
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
officers or have these done these kinds

1155
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,960
of operations you know that the family

1156
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,079
history the background the the way that

1157
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,880
the person brings from their past is

1158
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,440
very often decisive in the way the

1159
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,920
person reacts to your pitch or your

1160
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,040
approach and if you know that from

1161
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,319
before

1162
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,680
then you have an amazing advantage so

1163
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,319
this would be the last

1164
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,280
not less important uh

1165
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,160
issue that i would point out as a really

1166
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,400
big potential of genealogical ozine data

1167
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,359
collection okay in terms of social

1168
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,200
engineering

1169
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,680
now just to wrap it up and this is the

1170
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,359
last point because i know that i'm

1171
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,920
really really really on schedule and i'm

1172
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,079
not sure you have any questions

1173
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,680
please don't forget ethics okay this is

1174
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,079
just you know one of those issues where

1175
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,319
people are really emotional about and

1176
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,720
this has to do very often with very

1177
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,119
private issues like i've had for example

1178
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,599
a client that her father murdered her

1179
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,200
mother her mother and i found out

1180
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
through the investigation but she didn't

1181
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,760
told me because these are very personal

1182
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,960
issues and to use that to your own

1183
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,000
advantage is something that

1184
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,319
should not be done lightly at all and

1185
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,400
should be done only in issues like

1186
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,040
national security or something that's

1187
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,720
really worth to go and kind of try to

1188
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,280
find out these stories so

1189
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,440
uh it also

1190
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,520
points out and this is something of

1191
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,920
course that i work with every day how

1192
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,640
much personal data we're giving to these

1193
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,480
platforms and i'm not going to start

1194
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,240
talking about dna because that's an

1195
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,839
issue maybe for another

1196
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,079
presentation about people giving their

1197
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,240
dna and their emails and just you know

1198
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,240
finding their distant cousins and giving

1199
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,880
all their information but platforms like

1200
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,119
these will have signatures they will

1201
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,400
have

1202
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,359
land property they will have you know

1203
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,599
private data about your family as you

1204
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,040
saw like social security numbers um so

1205
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,240
this is also like uh kind of showing how

1206
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,160
this is also a vulnerability and a

1207
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,040
security issue so if you do have

1208
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,880
these kinds of trainings and privacy

1209
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,359
trainings try to include genealogical

1210
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,160
platforms also in the awareness courses

1211
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,079
that you're giving to people so that

1212
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,520
they are more

1213
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,440
yeah careful about what they share

1214
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,880
online

1215
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,440
so yeah i think that is it uh don't

1216
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,359
forget your ethics and boundaries just

1217
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,319
as i said and yeah thank you so much for

1218
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,480
having me it's like always a pleasure to

1219
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,400
be a lyric it's like such a good

1220
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,800
conference with such a good vibe and

1221
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,400
yeah that was basically it i think
