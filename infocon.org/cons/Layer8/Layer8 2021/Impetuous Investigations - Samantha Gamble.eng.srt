1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,319
my name is samantha and i am the pit

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,920
coordinator at the innocent lives

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,399
foundation

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,120
before i go a bit more into what i do at

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,160
the ilf and what the ilf does i wanted

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,679
to just introduce you to what we're

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,680
going to be talking about today

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,119
we are going to spend the next little

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,800
bit talking about something that i like

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,359
to call impetuous investigations

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,880
otherwise known as impulsive

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,400
investigations

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,480
the ultimate goal of this presentation

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,160
is for you to walk out of this with a

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,640
basic understanding of how cognitive

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
psychology especially biases affect our

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,079
decision making and ultimately our own

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,800
investigations

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,600
my primary role at the ilf is to oversee

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,239
the success of our pit the predator

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,160
identification team

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
that is our team of volunteers

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
investigators that help us unmask online

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,680
child predators

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,879
we are a non-vigilante non-profit

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,600
private predator hunting organization

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
so we actually seek out anyone who is

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
requesting or trading child sexual abuse

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
material that's thinking that they can

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,040
hide behind anonymity online

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,000
in addition to that i also teach ocean

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,799
to

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,880
law enforcement officials with heavy

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
focus on understanding predatory

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,360
behavior as well as terminology and

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,560
their digital footprint

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,119
if i'm not teaching osint specific i'm

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,759
also teaching darkweb of research and

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,320
tactics

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,400
again specifically related to internet

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
crimes against children

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
when i'm not with the ilf i hold a

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
position on the board of directors at

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,680
the idaho internet crimes against

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
children's coalition

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,680
so as we go into this presentation one

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,920
of the key factors throughout the entire

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
thing is something that's called

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,720
metacognition and stopping to think

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
about how we think

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
helps us work towards actionable

52
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,320
intelligence

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
metacognition is

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
just that it's intentional thinking

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,159
about how you can think and how you

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
learn

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
some observations you can make to

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
yourself about yourself is i'm seeing

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
i'm feeling i'm thinking i'm noticing

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
now i'm wondering

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,599
so what does psychology have to do with

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,599
open source intelligence

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
well behavior and overall cognitive

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
psychology

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
teaches us about the blind spots that

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
our biases can cause

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,599
having blind spots in this line of work

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,000
and in overall decision making can lead

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
us to improper conclusions

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,519
you definitely cannot stop yourself from

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,640
having biases but you can stop yourself

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
to think about how

73
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,560
they may be affecting your investigation

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
and how they may be persuading your uh

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
overall decision making

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,879
this is exactly where metacognition

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,120
comes into play really stop and think

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,760
about how you are thinking and how is it

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,760
affecting your current decisions

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,040
there is an entire sea of biases out

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
there as well as

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,959
much more educated books on cognitive

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,040
psychology but these were the ones that

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800
i found very interesting that i could

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
squeeze into the small amount of time

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,840
that we have together today

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,080
so we are going to be discussing

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,920
confirmation bias

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
anchoring bias

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,640
automation bias projection bias

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,879
overconfidence bias and then last but

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
not least the halo effect slash reverse

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
halo effect

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
so let's talk by or let's start by

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,040
discussing a confirmation bias

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
confirmation bias is when you're

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
favoring information that supports your

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,360
current preconceptions of something

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
while you disregard opposing evidence

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,159
that you might find

101
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,319
you're ultimately ignoring objective

102
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,480
facts and evidence and seeking out

103
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
things that evidence that supports your

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
current personal beliefs

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,280
i'm sure you see news outlets playing to

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
confirmation bias all the time and

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,920
that's why you see various information

108
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,040
that is

109
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,200
correct to their perspective

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,079
and not the others

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,358
so how does confirmation bias impact our

112
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,680
ocean investigations

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,919
well confirmation bias can cause us to

114
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,759
provide incorrect data incorrect data

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,160
leads us to improper conclusions

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,560
improper conclusions can lead to damaged

117
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
lives whether it's your own or someone

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,680
else's

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
someone may be terminated from

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,440
employment they may be improperly

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,639
convicted

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,960
or they or you may suffer overall

123
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
reputational damage

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,960
so again you cannot

125
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,880
force yourself to absolutely get rid of

126
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,919
this but you can stop and ask yourself

127
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,880
does my evidence only support my theory

128
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
have i considered opposing theories and

129
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
have i sought out those opposing

130
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
theories and have my searches been

131
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
specifically seeking validating

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,440
information

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
next is anchoring bias anchoring bias

134
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,320
sounds

135
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,120
in concept similar to confirmation bias

136
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
but it's different

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,479
in the effect that you're actually

138
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,240
anchoring onto a single piece of

139
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,160
information and allowing that to

140
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
overshadow any new information

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,800
where confirmation bias is when you are

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
actually actively seeking out

143
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
information that validates your current

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,960
perspective

145
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,280
anchoring bias is also known as the

146
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,560
focalism effect

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,639
it causes us to get tunnel vision on a

148
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,199
single piece of information anchoring us

149
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,440
into that persistent state of thought

150
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
and usually it's the piece of data that

151
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
we receive very early on

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,520
okay how does anchoring bias affect our

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,800
investigations

154
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,479
well when we get tunnel vision on single

155
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,639
pieces of information we lose our

156
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,120
ability to see any new data or pivot

157
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,520
points

158
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
so document that anchor point that you

159
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,919
absolutely cannot get out of your head

160
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,600
but be sure you're keeping an open mind

161
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,520
to different perspectives

162
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,759
so some of this mitigation can include

163
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,160
asking yourself have i been disregarding

164
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,240
information just because i deem it

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,520
insignificant

166
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,039
how different is this from what i

167
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,039
already originally knew

168
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,120
and what judgments have i made based on

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,319
my initial perception

170
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
another huge one that we see especially

171
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,240
in this industry is automation bias or

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,880
the over reliance on automated decision

173
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
making systems now this can be

174
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
applicable to all sorts of aspects of

175
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
life but i'm going to talk specifically

176
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
about um

177
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,360
even infosec oscent

178
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,960
anything that uses automated tools

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,360
so as humans we tend to take the path of

180
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
least cognitive effort it saves our

181
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,039
brain power there's nothing wrong with

182
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:57,840
that

183
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
and while automation has proven to be

184
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,919
useful in speeding up processes and

185
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,319
finding new data points definitely does

186
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,240
not replace the need for a human element

187
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
so how does automation bias impact

188
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,319
investigations

189
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,240
well basing our judgments strictly from

190
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
automated results leads us to skewed

191
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,599
skewed conclusions as well as

192
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,240
false positives especially if an account

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,400
doesn't actually belong to your target

194
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
whether it's a person or an entity

195
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
whether they share a similar username

196
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,599
business name

197
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,680
whatever it may be

198
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,599
multigo is excellent but it does come

199
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,840
back with false positives still a great

200
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,000
tool still incredible for finding new

201
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
data points but you definitely need to

202
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,520
be sure that you're sitting down and

203
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
actually going through that and seeing

204
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,720
what actually belongs to your target

205
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
so ask yourself

206
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,800
or be sure that you are always reviewing

207
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,639
and verifying your automated results

208
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,560
keep in mind tools are excellent to

209
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
supplement your thought process

210
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,160
but it's definitely not something to

211
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,080
replace your overall thought process

212
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,000
especially not your decision making

213
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,919
and then question if results are

214
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
actually related to your person or area

215
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,879
of interest or entity and then document

216
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,400
it if you can't confirm that it is

217
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
projection bias this is the assumption

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,319
that other people think feel believe and

219
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,280
behave

220
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,039
like you currently do

221
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,440
this can also be your future self and

222
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,520
assuming that your current self

223
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,000
thinks feels believes and behaves

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,679
exactly how your future self will

225
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,880
this type of bias is a self forecasting

226
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,919
error

227
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,240
we underestimate the influence of our

228
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
current mental states on our own

229
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,640
behavior causing us to make decisions

230
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,319
that need instant gratification

231
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,120
it's a projection of future preferences

232
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,279
or our projection of future preferences

233
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
depends on our current state this is

234
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,519
also known as an empathy gap

235
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
but overall projection bias is the

236
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,240
unconscious assumption that others

237
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
share the same beliefs thoughts or

238
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,399
values that you do

239
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
failure to acknowledge this bias can not

240
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,040
only lead to impulsive decision-making

241
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
but it can also lead to missed data

242
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,399
points operational security areas

243
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,200
or

244
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,720
errors skewed results and

245
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,160
overall being unprepared

246
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,720
so be sure to ask yourself

247
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,240
what's my current state of mind or

248
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,480
emotion and how is it affecting my

249
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,519
current

250
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,800
decision making throughout my

251
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,320
investigation

252
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
am i judging the situation in a way that

253
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,800
only suits my current needs

254
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,120
or am i considering my potential future

255
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
scenarios or needs that i may not

256
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
currently be prepared for and how might

257
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,080
i prepare for those

258
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,440
the next one is overconfidence bias

259
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,839
overconfidence bias can be especially

260
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,399
detrimental it's when we overestimate

261
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,800
our own

262
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,120
abilities overconfidence can be

263
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
influenced by behavioral factors

264
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,480
emotional factors cognitive factors and

265
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
even environmental which i don't have

266
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,760
listed here

267
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,920
inflated confidence causes us to take

268
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,000
certain issues lightly some great

269
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
examples include ethics communications

270
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
especially skill level

271
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,880
the higher the level of overconfidence

272
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,000
the higher the level of risk

273
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,519
there's definitely a key difference

274
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,920
between overconfidence and confidence

275
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,800
when we start embellishing our abilities

276
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,720
or our capability to understand a

277
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,760
certain situations both to ourselves and

278
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
others we run a pretty heavy risk of

279
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,399
having distorted perceptions and when it

280
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,720
comes to osint that puts us in an even

281
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
higher risk for operational security

282
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,120
mistakes

283
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,519
or even ethical mistakes some of the

284
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,440
worst ethical mistakes come from

285
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
overconfidence

286
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,240
so just keep in mind

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,399
no one can know everything and there is

288
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,160
a ton of strength in acknowledging what

289
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,720
you don't know and even more strength in

290
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
seeking out the opinion of somebody who

291
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,279
may know about something that you don't

292
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,519
currently have the right

293
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,079
knowledge on

294
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
but just be sure that you're not

295
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
revealing any details that you're not

296
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,839
supposed

297
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,399
to and what i mean by that is you can

298
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,959
seek out help in ocean investigations

299
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,720
but be sure that you're not revealing

300
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,079
who the client is who your target is any

301
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,399
pii things uh surrounding your target

302
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,240
and or client and so forth

303
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,279
overconfidence can pretty heavily play

304
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,720
into the halo and reverse halo effect

305
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,560
now these effects are when perceived

306
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,639
characteristics of a person cause us to

307
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,440
have positive or negative bias towards

308
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
their overall personality

309
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,440
so with the halo effect it's when you're

310
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
viewing the person as an angel so a

311
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,160
positive impression equals higher trust

312
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,079
that we place in them which leads to

313
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,480
further positive assumptions

314
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
so the if you know somebody or an entity

315
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,240
like a company has a positive quality

316
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
you're more likely to come to the

317
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
conclusion that they have other positive

318
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,399
traits and let those overshadow any

319
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,200
negative traits

320
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
whereas the reverse halo effect is the

321
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,720
exact opposite it's also known as the

322
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
horn and or devil effect

323
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,440
so if you know a person or entity has a

324
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
negative quality you're much more likely

325
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,079
to come to the conclusion that they have

326
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,160
other negative traits and allow that

327
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,959
impression to define your overall

328
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,000
uh

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,040
judge of their character

330
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,279
so a negative impression equals lower

331
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,920
trust which leads to further negative

332
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,479
assumptions

333
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,279
both of these can heavily cloud our

334
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,680
judgment in overall decision making and

335
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,959
our osint investigations

336
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
the halo effect is part of why social

337
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,959
engineering can be so effective

338
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,880
especially if you're creating a positive

339
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
rapport with that person

340
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
but you have to be careful to not make

341
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,800
that person start to question

342
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,920
those positive traits

343
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,320
overconfidence bias supplements both of

344
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
these because we're pretty prone to

345
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,519
believing that would never happen to me

346
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,000
i would never make that call

347
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
i would know if this was a

348
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,760
if this was a fake person

349
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,519
i would know if this was a bad person

350
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
so it's fairly easy to see how that can

351
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
really heavily influence

352
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,800
our decision making and other people's

353
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,599
decision making

354
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
unfortunately i don't have time to go

355
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,199
into

356
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,399
in depth on each of those biases um

357
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,000
hopefully by now you at least have a

358
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,959
basic understanding of how cognitive

359
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,040
psychology influences the way that we

360
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,279
perceive things and how we react to

361
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,839
those things

362
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,399
remember that no one is immune to biases

363
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,320
and you can't force yourself to not have

364
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,279
them

365
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,000
but you can be aware of them and you can

366
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
be aware of the impact that they have on

367
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
your decision making

368
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,279
but when we let impulse guide our

369
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,839
decision making we run into much higher

370
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,320
risks especially when it comes to

371
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,240
investigations and social engineering

372
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,600
i am happy to answer any questions

373
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,959
in the chat or wherever is applicable

374
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,399
there are some ways that you can support

375
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,240
the innocent lives foundation and learn

376
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,720
more about what we do as i mentioned we

377
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,880
are a non-profit group that actually

378
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,800
seek out anyone who is hiding behind

379
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
anonymity online while they abuse

380
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,880
children

381
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,680
but that is all for now thank you
