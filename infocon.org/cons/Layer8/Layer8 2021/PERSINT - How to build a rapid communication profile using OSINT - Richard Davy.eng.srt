00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,280
hi welcome to percent personality based

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,360
open source intelligence gathering an

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,880
approach to intelligence gathering that

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,920
focuses on the human

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,880
element my name is richard davey i'm a

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,199
red team lead at the home depot my focus

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,720
is in social engineering physical

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,199
penetration testing and open source

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,760
intelligence

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,119
in this talk we'll briefly cover what

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,880
social engineering is

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
what sc attacks benefit from open source

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,800
intelligence and personality based open

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,239
source intelligence

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,160
what open source intelligence is why we

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
would gather it where we might get it

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,520
and the importance it plays in social

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,040
engineering engagements and red seeming

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,160
engagements

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,040
and then we'll cover what

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,320
personality-based open source

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,680
intelligence is

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,000
where we might find it and why we might

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,399
be looking for it

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,640
so first what is social engineering well

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,320
michael tyler says in his book brain

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
hacking that at its core social

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
engineering is the building and

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,199
leveraging of influence in order to

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,760
persuade others to act as you want them

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,879
to

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,119
or put another way to get someone to

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,840
make a decision that benefits you

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
now i like this definition as it relates

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to social engineering engagements or red

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,840
teaming engagements

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,439
but when i social engineer my best

38
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,119
friend and they're telling me about

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,799
their plans or whereabouts for their

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,400
birthday so that i can throw them a

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,360
surprise party that doesn't benefit me

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,439
or if i'm social engineering my teenager

43
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,960
into telling me where they're actually

44
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
going to be on saturday night so that i

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
can make sure that they're safe or not

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,560
getting into trouble

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
that benefits them sure it helps my

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,320
peace of mind but

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
ultimately it benefits them

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,200
but when i social engineer my boss into

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,040
giving me a pay raise or an extra week

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,520
of paid vacation that benefits me

53
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,040
if i'm performing a social engineering

54
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,479
engagement where i social engineer

55
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,240
someone into letting me into a building

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,680
or clicking a malicious link in a

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
phishing email that obviously doesn't

58
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,960
benefit them

59
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
it benefits me

60
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,000
so

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
social engineering is the building and

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,799
leveraging of influence in order to

63
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,479
persuade others to act in a manner that

64
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,680
is for yours or their own best interest

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,840
the practice of influence or influencing

66
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,919
or persuading an individual into taking

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,079
some action based on some input

68
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,640
so what social engineering attacks

69
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
benefit from the use of open source

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
intelligence or personality based open

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
source intelligence well first we have

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
phishing we have to know the email and

73
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
then if we perform a spear phishing

74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,239
attack we're going to need to know a

75
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,920
little bit of information to make that

76
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,280
look legitimate

77
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
and then phishing which is voice

78
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,879
phishing i'm going to call you up but

79
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,080
first i have to have your phone number

80
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
and i have to know what i need to talk

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
about or who i need to be when i call

82
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,959
you

83
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,560
then smishing i have to have a phone

84
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,000
number again and then i need to know

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
what kind of text message it is that i

86
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,000
need to send to have you interact with

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,879
it

88
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,280
we have impersonation which neat it

89
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
requires a decent amount of open source

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,879
intelligence i need to know where the

91
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,400
office is i need to know who i need to

92
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
be when i show up and what i need to be

93
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,640
talking about or wearing or or how i

94
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,720
should approach

95
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,319
and then we have pre-pending if you

96
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,319
don't know what pre-pending is basically

97
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,640
this is the act of tagging someone on

98
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,280
social media to gain more interaction

99
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,640
well first you have to know their social

100
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,920
media handle and then you have to know

101
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,519
the topics that they're talking about

102
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,959
and what it is that they're interested

103
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,959
in so that you can engage them and build

104
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
that interaction

105
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
so what is open source intelligence well

106
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
from the office of the director of

107
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,680
national intelligence it is intelligence

108
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
produced from publicly available

109
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,599
information that is collected

110
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,239
exploited and disseminated in a timely

111
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,400
manner to an appropriate audience for

112
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
the purpose of addressing a specific

113
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
intelligence requirement

114
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
the focus here is that it's intelligence

115
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,440
produced from publicly available

116
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,680
information

117
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,519
we're gaining this information from

118
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,920
public resources open social media we're

119
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,200
not going and stealing it from a

120
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,439
computer or a file covenant

121
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,439
in today's world a large portion of that

122
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,760
data can be collected online but osim

123
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
predates the internet so it was

124
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
previously collected from newspapers

125
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
physical bulletin boards magazines and

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,120
still can be today

127
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,159
so why why might we be performing an

128
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,120
oscent exercise well attackers and

129
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
offensive security researchers alike are

130
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,199
looking for pieces of intelligence that

131
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,040
make targeting a business or an

132
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,358
individual easier attackers for

133
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,800
malicious purposes and offensive

134
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
security researchers to educate

135
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
companies and individuals on what might

136
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
make them vulnerable

137
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
such as social media sites that are

138
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,120
leaking user names or leaking sensitive

139
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
company information or maybe they're

140
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,520
leaking details of office spaces or

141
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,639
computer systems maybe in pictures

142
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,120
or news that details recent developments

143
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,199
or if the company's doing well or poorly

144
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
or have they been breached or do they

145
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,880
announce technological advances

146
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
and then the people the individuals in

147
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
the company the team the structures the

148
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
culture what that might look like these

149
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
are just a few things that an attacker

150
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
or an offensive security researcher may

151
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
be looking for to make them sound a

152
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,039
little bit more legitimate which is why

153
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,960
this is important we want to sound

154
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,520
legitimate when we are approaching a

155
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,360
company for the purposes of social

156
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,919
engineering or red teaming we want to

157
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,400
drill down on our target acquisition who

158
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,320
am i targeting what am i going to target

159
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
so i'm not all over the place and just

160
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
acting sporadically

161
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
i need to know the language what phrases

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
or words or technological details should

163
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
i know or speak about

164
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
the location where am i going what am i

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
looking for when i get there especially

166
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
if i'm going to perform an impersonation

167
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
attack

168
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,560
the vendors who can i be to get in the

169
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,080
building or if i'm going to send a

170
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
package from a vendor who doesn't need

171
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,440
to come from

172
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,360
the people who works there how long have

173
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
they been there who do they talk to

174
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
outside of work or at work or who are

175
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
they close to that they work with

176
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
these are all valuable pieces of

177
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,240
intelligence that get me closer to my

178
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,800
goal of appearing legitimate as security

179
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,639
personnel if something looks as if it

180
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,039
doesn't belong it's probably wrong

181
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,639
attackers and offensive security

182
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,199
researchers want to appear as legitimate

183
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,120
as possible to keep suspicions low and

184
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,840
prevent an incident

185
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,960
so what first

186
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
right when i first start an open source

187
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
intelligence exercise

188
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,039
what do i do first well first i set some

189
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,000
goals

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
why do i need the intelligence in the

191
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,880
first place

192
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
the next is scope who's off limits who's

193
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,280
not what facilities are assets or

194
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,479
off-limits and what se attacks are

195
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
allowed and which ones are not because

196
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
that might actually determine the type

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,919
of intelligence i seek and the depth at

198
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,840
which i choose to seek it because if i'm

199
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
performing generic phishing i only need

200
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,800
email addresses if i'm performing spear

201
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,759
phishing

202
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
i need a little bit more information and

203
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,160
if i'm impersonating someone that should

204
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,560
be there i'm going to need a lot of

205
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
information

206
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,800
the next thing i need to do is identify

207
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,199
the gaps i have in intelligence so we do

208
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,880
a brief gap analysis what do i know

209
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
today

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,919
the company name hopefully

211
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,240
maybe some people inside the company

212
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
versus what do i need to know where the

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,319
company's located who their vendors are

214
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,919
phone numbers email addresses etc

215
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,599
so once i've gotten my goals and i've

216
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
defined scope and i've done a brief gap

217
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,000
analysis now i can look at the where

218
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,919
where am i going to get the information

219
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,639
that i'm seeking

220
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,520
so

221
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
we can look at social media facebook

222
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,599
twitter instagram

223
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,960
myspace

224
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
i think it still exists

225
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,880
we look at vsco.co or radio.fm or maybe

226
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,560
we could go and look at

227
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
foursquare

228
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
professional social media such as

229
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
linkedin linkedin is a great place to

230
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,680
get information about a company and the

231
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,599
individuals that work at the company

232
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,759
their specific roles or responsibilities

233
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,440
the tools that they use

234
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,039
company job wrecks are posted on

235
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,960
linkedin that detail what the company is

236
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
looking for because of specific software

237
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,879
tools that they have internally

238
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,479
we could go to blogs and community

239
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,680
platforms

240
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
online databases search engine

241
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,720
manipulations such as google dorks we'd

242
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
also look at public hearings and sec

243
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
filings or professional and academic

244
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,199
publications academic papers

245
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,960
all of these are great places to find

246
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,039
information

247
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,199
what we're doing is we're approaching

248
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,360
these public forums and locations in a

249
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
methodical format

250
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,440
so that we can gain strategic pieces of

251
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
intelligence to answer specific

252
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
questions

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,199
so we've defined our goals our scope

254
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,839
what se attacks we can perform

255
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,839
we've done a brief gap analysis we know

256
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,360
what we need to know and we know what we

257
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,719
already know

258
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,159
we know where we're gonna find that

259
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,958
information so now we get to do some

260
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,959
intelligence gathering

261
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,720
we head over to google we start digging

262
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
we find social media details company

263
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,720
profiles job wrecks

264
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,240
news articles

265
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,519
what does it look like

266
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
this is xyz corp

267
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,839
they specialize in sales and marketing

268
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,760
we located several high-value targets

269
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,560
including their ceo joey bates their cfo

270
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
mark asensa head of operations

271
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
head of security jack ryan don't mess

272
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
with that guy

273
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,440
their internal teams include i.t finance

274
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
and marketing inside of it they have a

275
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,839
team working on a custom crm and erp

276
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,120
software so they can get away from

277
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
salesforce and sap

278
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
they have custom hr software written in

279
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
c-sharp and then custom databasing tools

280
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,640
written in java

281
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
they recently partnered with aws to

282
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,839
migrate all of their internal

283
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
microservice infrastructure to the cloud

284
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,399
currently they're looking for sap

285
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,000
engineers and experienced salesforce

286
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,760
users until their custom tooling is

287
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,360
complete

288
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,959
they have several associates who attend

289
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,880
a company get together at a local bar

290
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,120
and grill on friday after work

291
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
they have a company reddit and facebook

292
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,279
and twitter page that have no

293
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,800
restrictions allowing anybody on the

294
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
internet to see them

295
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,839
and then their marketing department has

296
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,440
a public instagram page where they like

297
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,880
to share pictures of their calendars

298
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
detailing holidays and birthdays and

299
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
days off pictures of their desks and

300
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
their office spaces and then pictures of

301
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
their associates wearing their rfid

302
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
security badges and their corporate

303
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,160
polos

304
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,760
on that instagram page we were able to

305
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,320
find grant grant hofstede is a project

306
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,079
manager he's been at the company for a

307
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,160
year so he probably doesn't know what

308
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,760
information he should be releasing and

309
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,880
what information he shouldn't be

310
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,000
releasing

311
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
he reports to a senior manager named

312
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
sean delaney

313
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,519
sean is out of office on vacation for

314
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,720
the next two weeks according to the

315
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
marketing department's leaked calendar

316
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,279
on instagram this gives us a way that we

317
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,000
can spearfish grant

318
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
grant has three direct reports all of

319
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,440
who have been at xyz longer than he has

320
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,279
he uses a well-known project management

321
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,880
tool called smartsheets you may have

322
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
heard of it and keeps a personal board

323
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,440
of work tasks on trello that he forgot

324
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,240
to make private

325
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
he has two social media handles that we

326
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
found grant hof rocks hyphen bang bang

327
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
and de hoffenader

328
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
he leaked his corporate username format

329
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,279
on reddit when asking questions about

330
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
specific tools used internally

331
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,720
g.m.hofstead

332
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,000
and his company email g.m.hofstead

333
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,040
emp.xyzcorp.com

334
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,959
so we have really good intelligence here

335
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,160
chunks of information that could

336
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,320
potentially lead to a compromise

337
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
or at the very least give us enough

338
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,079
information to build a pretext that

339
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,279
could lead to compromise

340
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,920
so what did i miss

341
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,160
here's the deal this is a great stopping

342
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,360
point we answered all of our

343
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
intelligence requirements we were able

344
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,480
to successfully close the gap between

345
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,720
what we knew and what we didn't know

346
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
many successful social engineering

347
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,640
engagements and red team operations have

348
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,680
been run from this level of osun so

349
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,440
honestly nothing we could stop here

350
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,519
but what if i told you that you could go

351
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,839
a little deeper down the rabbit hole

352
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,760
and the payoff may be an increase in

353
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,600
successful social engineering pretext

354
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
execution or at the very least a better

355
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,360
understanding of the people that you're

356
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
dealing with on the other end

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,279
to do so

358
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,920
we answer some basic questions

359
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,959
starting with who is my target

360
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,200
what does my target want me to think

361
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,399
about them how do they want to be

362
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,880
treated what do they desire or need what

363
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,720
are their likes or dislikes

364
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
how do they view themselves and others

365
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,639
ultimately i want to know who my target

366
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,760
is and how i should approach them

367
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
so how do i find that information well

368
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
percent

369
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
personality based open source

370
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,760
intelligence

371
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,440
is open source information that you

372
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,600
would gather by studying

373
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
and understanding a person's social

374
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
media or their professional social media

375
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,160
blog posts and professional articles or

376
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,399
even the way that they comment or remark

377
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,959
on other people's posts

378
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,320
and articles

379
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,399
the purpose is to build an idea of the

380
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,480
type of pretext you may use to engage

381
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,279
them

382
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,040
if i wanted to engage a target at a

383
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
coffee shop how should i talk to do that

384
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
what should i say

385
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,639
what topic should i focus on

386
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
this isn't what they do or when they do

387
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,639
it or even how they do it this is who

388
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,399
they are when they do it

389
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,040
so what

390
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
you might actually be thinking so what

391
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
why do i need this phishing emails have

392
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,800
very little to no emotion associated

393
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,639
with them i can play on fear of missing

394
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,480
out or authority or maybe even fear of

395
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
loss i can impersonate a vendor without

396
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,560
this information

397
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
why do i need this

398
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
so two things in my opinion humble

399
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,560
opinion as it is

400
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,600
the first

401
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
success

402
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
the ability to successfully approach a

403
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,160
target

404
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,480
or bump a target from a few steps away

405
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
and get their attention

406
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
captivate their interest and get them

407
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,680
involved

408
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
we want them to interact we want them to

409
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,120
talk how do we do that the second we're

410
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,519
not the bad guys at the end of the

411
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,760
engagement or the interaction when the

412
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
target finds out that they were indeed a

413
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,199
target

414
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,079
they need to remember that you did not

415
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,560
leave them feeling horrible we should

416
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
always leave them feeling better for

417
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,240
having met us

418
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,000
we do this by helping them feel more

419
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,399
connected we're like them we speak like

420
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,480
them we have similar interests

421
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
there was a scientific paper titled

422
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
highlighting relatedness promotes

423
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
pro-social motives and behaviors

424
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,320
in it researchers noted that when giving

425
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,199
tasks if they highlighted relatedness

426
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,279
the result was higher interest in

427
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,560
volunteering

428
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
and intentions to volunteer

429
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
additionally they found

430
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
that when participants wrote about

431
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,440
relatedness experiences that action

432
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,839
alone promoted feelings of connectedness

433
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,399
to others

434
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,800
when we find that others are like us we

435
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
want to be around them more it gives us

436
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,880
a sense of being a part of a group or a

437
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,959
tribe and helps us feel more connected

438
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,639
to the person

439
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,639
the next thing is our target should feel

440
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,680
accepted we as humans have an innate

441
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,959
requirement to be socially socially

442
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,600
accepted for who we are

443
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,680
in the paper the need to belong roy

444
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,000
ballmeister and mark leary

445
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
leary stated in their conclusions

446
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,240
we found evidence of basic desire to

447
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,639
form social attachments people form

448
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,240
social bonds readily even under

449
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,399
seemingly adverse conditions

450
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,079
people who have anything in common who

451
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,399
shared common even unpleasant

452
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,760
experiences

453
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
or who simply are exposed to each other

454
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,120
frequently

455
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,440
tend to form friendships or other

456
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
attachments

457
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,880
they go on to say that forming or

458
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,199
solidifying social attachments generally

459
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,279
produces positive emotions

460
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,600
whereas real imagined or even potential

461
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
threats to social bonds

462
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
generate a variety of unpleasant

463
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
emotions

464
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,639
next our target should feel appreciated

465
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,920
for their points of view their

466
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
uniqueness thoughts and opinions that

467
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,040
they have

468
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,199
feeling appreciated makes us feel more

469
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,040
connected and deepens our sense of

470
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,279
purpose or meaning in life

471
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,880
and then lastly

472
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,519
we're there to make them feel heard

473
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,759
give them permission to speak

474
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,000
it's a weird statement i know so let me

475
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,199
explain

476
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
nothing feels worse than trying to talk

477
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
to someone who is looking at their phone

478
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
or doesn't seem to be interested in what

479
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,079
we're saying

480
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,920
it literally makes us feel as if we

481
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,399
should just stop talking take our

482
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,279
thoughts

483
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,360
and go elsewhere

484
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,480
why

485
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,160
because we love being heard we love

486
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,639
being listened to we speak about

487
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,199
ourselves and our desires and our needs

488
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,519
and the hopes that someone

489
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,000
will listen

490
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,399
so actively listening and engaging the

491
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,880
target because you have an idea of who

492
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,000
they are and what they need

493
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
can literally open the conversation and

494
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,880
offer them a platform

495
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,759
to be heard on

496
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,199
so we know why we should be doing this

497
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,800
where do we look

498
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,720
social media sites professional social

499
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,120
media sites blogs personal web pages

500
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,959
professional web pages

501
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,720
it's not really any different than the

502
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
tools we're already using for oscent

503
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,199
the approach is different

504
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,799
what we're looking for is different

505
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,720
sam gosling

506
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,359
a professor of psychology spent years

507
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,679
snooping through people's things

508
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,280
knowingly i think

509
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
to discover what their personal space

510
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,600
tells us about the

511
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,640
big five ocean personality traits

512
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
openness conscientiousness extroversion

513
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
agreeableness

514
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,799
and neuroticism and he said this in

515
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,360
regard to snooping people's personal

516
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
websites

517
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
websites are extraordinarily to include

518
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,440
social media good places to learn about

519
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,320
people perhaps the best of all places

520
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,240
our site snooping yielded information

521
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,559
that was at least as accurate as what we

522
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,960
learned from the bedrooms offices and

523
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,440
music collections

524
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,880
we studied

525
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,840
and accurate across a much broader array

526
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
of personality variables than most other

527
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
domains

528
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,280
he goes on to say that websites proved

529
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
useful for learning about all five

530
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,440
traits

531
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,919
so in this

532
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,799
nice blurry graph here you can see that

533
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,400
websites

534
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,960
offered as accurate if not more accurate

535
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,000
information than the bedroom did in all

536
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,840
five

537
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,000
trades it offered more information in

538
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,760
the office and more information than the

539
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,840
music top ten

540
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,799
now

541
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,160
i want to point out that these are

542
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
places we spend a large amount of time

543
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,960
our bedroom it's where we feel

544
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,240
comfortable this is this is how we are

545
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,600
are

546
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,840
comfortable our bedroom is set up in a

547
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,480
manner that suits us our office we spend

548
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
seven to nine hours in the covid world

549
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,240
we spend 10 to 12 hours

550
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,280
and it's in our home

551
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,200
and websites and social media sites

552
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,799
offer as much

553
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,480
or as accurate of information

554
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
and what's even better is in today's

555
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,160
world with selfies and and pictures and

556
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,080
the rate at which we take pictures

557
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,760
because we have a camera in our pocket

558
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,280
at all times

559
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
personal blogs websites social media can

560
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,960
also give us insight into

561
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,760
bedrooms and offices

562
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,919
that we didn't have before

563
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,440
you can't just break into an office

564
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
that's not open source intelligence but

565
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,880
when it's open source intelligence

566
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,799
because it's on social media it's open

567
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,360
source intelligence the bedroom

568
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,760
you can get an idea of what how they how

569
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
they act or how they're comfortable or

570
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,080
who they are from their bedroom and they

571
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
probably have pictures of it on social

572
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
media

573
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,039
so

574
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,200
what are we looking for when we're

575
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,880
perusing their social media trying to

576
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,320
get an idea of who our target is

577
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,679
language

578
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,520
how do they talk about themselves about

579
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,200
others about life or work or current

580
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,679
topics the pictures

581
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,720
who's in them where are they at

582
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,520
and then their interactions

583
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,120
how do they interact with people how do

584
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,918
they respond

585
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,760
you've probably heard the saying words

586
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
create worlds

587
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,600
so when focusing on language we really

588
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,200
want to focus on the words how they're

589
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,559
put together

590
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,760
how do they speak do they reference

591
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,960
themselves a lot do they speak about

592
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
their teams those outside of their

593
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,039
circles why is that important it gives

594
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,960
us an idea of how they view the world

595
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
and themselves in it

596
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
people who speak about themselves a lot

597
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
may be self-involved or more concerned

598
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,440
with how they fit into the bigger

599
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,520
picture so approaching them with verbage

600
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
that focuses on teams or their groups or

601
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,280
their families you're probably

602
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,480
alienating them and they're going to

603
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,840
stop listening

604
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
people who speak about the team or the

605
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,880
group or their clubs or their

606
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
affiliations may be more interested in

607
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,799
how the team or the group or club is

608
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,120
viewed overall so pitching an idea or

609
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,280
discussing at length their individual

610
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
accomplishments or achievements or

611
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
individual goals or ideas may alienate

612
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,280
them and ultimately leave them feeling

613
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,440
as if you're not listening

614
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,960
if they're self-focused you might hear

615
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,520
things like i me my

616
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,080
what i have what i've done what i'm

617
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,240
doing this affects me or this is mine

618
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,080
you may see this in their actual written

619
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,600
language on their social media sites

620
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
team focused language might

621
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,760
look like we are all working really hard

622
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,520
here or our success is really a team

623
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,760
effort or so and so and i the they're

624
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,039
always referencing uh

625
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,679
their group of people or

626
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,600
their relationships as opposed to

627
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
themselves

628
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,120
outside verbage may be things like that

629
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,799
group or those guys or that company

630
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,559
anything that's not directly referenced

631
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,480
to them or the people that they directly

632
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,280
associate with

633
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,360
another thing that we could look at is

634
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,080
the satur communication types

635
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,559
so virginia saturn in the 1970s came up

636
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,960
with these communication times and there

637
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
are five of them we have the blamer

638
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,679
always finding fault never accepting

639
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,600
responsibility

640
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,840
always blaming someone else or the

641
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,320
placator who all who's always out to

642
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,640
please or never asserting or disagreeing

643
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,880
and always seeking approval

644
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,720
the computer personality or

645
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,880
communication type very correct and

646
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,440
proper with no emotion or maybe masking

647
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,080
or feeling uh vulnerable but trying to

648
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,840
cover it up

649
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,360
and then the distractor seeking

650
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
attention to compensate for loneliness

651
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,000
or inadequacy or whatever it may be so

652
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,760
they're always telling these big bold

653
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,919
stories or they're always blaming or

654
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,320
yelling or creating disruption and then

655
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,440
the leveler

656
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
usually assertive with the goal of

657
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,120
mutual problem solving they don't mask

658
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,480
their emotions they're very comfortable

659
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,640
with who they are

660
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
these details alone might help us better

661
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,760
associate with the target

662
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,559
if it's always someone else's problem

663
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,960
you can be that person relate to that

664
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,400
with the target

665
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,760
maybe they need attention can you

666
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,440
provide that what type of attention are

667
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
they looking for

668
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,679
maybe they placate and getting them to

669
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,360
fulfill a request wouldn't take very

670
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
much effort once a connection has been

671
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,080
established

672
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,919
next is how much or what are they saying

673
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,600
are they super chatty or don't say a lot

674
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,679
at all do they use abstract language or

675
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,440
very direct and concrete language just

676
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
literally the differences in

677
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,799
extraversion and introversion

678
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
in a research article titled when

679
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,520
feeling speak

680
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,360
camille bucaboom

681
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,559
i think that's how you pronounce the

682
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,320
name and a group of researchers

683
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
discovered interesting notes on the

684
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,320
distinguishability between extroverts

685
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,080
and introverts language

686
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
finding that extroverts when describing

687
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,919
what they see in photographs tend to use

688
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,840
more abstract language

689
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,159
while introverts appear to be a lot more

690
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,520
specific about what they saw

691
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
jordan peterson and jacob hirsch from

692
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,039
the university of toronto

693
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,600
asked students

694
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,279
to write about past experiences and

695
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,480
future goals

696
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
in the written language they discovered

697
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
that the more liberal a person was

698
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,080
the more words they used pertaining to

699
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,520
senses

700
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,679
the more neurotic the more they referred

701
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,559
to the emotional angst of the situation

702
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,159
and the more conscientious the more

703
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,480
language is centered around achievements

704
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,720
and work-related phrases and terms

705
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
another study

706
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,000
tell me a story and i will tell you who

707
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,799
you are

708
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,440
took a hundred students

709
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,279
and a group of german researchers led by

710
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,679
albrecht kufner

711
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,000
gave the students five word pro words as

712
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
prompt plane crash parlor made fireworks

713
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,159
middle ages and supermarket to write a

714
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,320
creative story they found two things

715
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,440
first

716
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,279
open-minded participants

717
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,120
produced more creative stories and the

718
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,600
more agreeable participants created

719
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,039
stories with a higher social vibe to

720
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,559
them

721
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,400
the second thing they observed was that

722
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
when having a second set of participants

723
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,720
judge the traits of the authors

724
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,400
they were fairly accurate in doing so

725
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,760
and the last study i'll cover here is

726
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,640
taliyarcone and his paper personality in

727
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,279
a hundred thousand words

728
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,240
researched and analyzed

729
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,840
694 blogs over the course of about two

730
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,919
years

731
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,840
the group of individual bloggers was on

732
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,440
average predominantly female with an

733
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,320
average of age of 36 he then compared

734
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,400
this reading to answers given in a

735
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,360
personality questionnaire by the authors

736
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
what he found was that contrary to the

737
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,960
belief that we

738
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,799
get to tell people what we want them to

739
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,559
believe on the internet the choice of

740
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,279
words by the author consistently alluded

741
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,240
to their personality types more neurotic

742
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,600
people used more

743
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,000
words associated with negative emotions

744
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,320
and more extroverted people used more

745
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,440
words pertaining to positive emotions

746
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
those scoring high unagreeableness would

747
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,440
avoid swear words and use more words

748
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,919
related to communality

749
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,159
and the consciences blogger

750
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,200
again

751
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,679
mentioned achievements

752
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,440
and wrote in terms of works accomplished

753
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,080
all things that tell us about this

754
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
person we can gather from the words that

755
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,159
they're putting out on their social

756
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,240
media

757
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,880
james pinabaker says this who would have

758
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,159
ever predicted that a high school

759
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,840
student who uses too many verbs in her

760
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,159
college admissions essay is likely to

761
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,559
make lower grades in college

762
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,799
or that a poet whoever uses the word i

763
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,559
in his poetry is at a higher risk of

764
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,320
suicide

765
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
he goes on to say that by looking more

766
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,000
carefully at the ways people convey

767
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,400
their thoughts and language we can begin

768
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,480
to get a sense of their personalities

769
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,840
emotions and connections with others

770
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,000
having that insight

771
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,080
to understand someone's emotions or

772
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,440
their personalities can be the

773
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,520
difference in connecting and not

774
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,080
connecting

775
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,720
next

776
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,799
what do you see in their pictures

777
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,640
are they celebrating or partying maybe

778
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,559
they just like to have fun are their

779
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,000
pictures dark

780
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
hoodie hood covering the face or are

781
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,679
they creating barriers even in their

782
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,000
images maybe with a pillow or a person

783
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,120
because they're uncomfortable

784
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,360
what does that say about them maybe they

785
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,039
only want you to think they want to be

786
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,120
left alone there are several groups and

787
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,559
cliques that exist in the world today

788
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,919
that resonate with that style of

789
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,080
interaction and just like all humans who

790
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
need to connect with someone this is a

791
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,880
statement to connect

792
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,919
what does the body language represent

793
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,240
are smiles fake

794
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,360
if the

795
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,039
target is at an event where they're semi

796
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,559
unaware of the photos that are being

797
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,919
taken

798
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,000
how do they look are they enjoying

799
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,679
themselves

800
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,679
what do their selfies say about them

801
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,640
remember

802
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,720
selfies unlike the embarrassing photo

803
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,159
your friend posted of you from that

804
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,159
crazy night at the bar

805
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,240
are user approved

806
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,559
the message in the image

807
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,799
is exactly what the target individual

808
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,720
wants you to think about them

809
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,080
they're after all

810
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,640
the messenger the creator and the owner

811
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,720
of the portrait and very rarely do we

812
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,960
put a selfie on the internet with the

813
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,399
intent of generating a negative response

814
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,120
this is a person seeking a personal

815
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,320
positive response

816
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,399
what are what are some tag lines that

817
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,159
we've seen in selfies

818
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,600
maybe their approval seeking with a

819
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
caption like

820
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
one of my photos always looks so

821
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,799
horrible

822
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,200
or i'm always such a mess

823
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,159
i wish i was more put together

824
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,520
maybe they're taking selfies with their

825
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
new car or their new clothes or their

826
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,799
new accessories because they want you to

827
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,240
think that they're successful or

828
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,679
fashionable

829
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,880
that may be something you could build a

830
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,640
conversation off of

831
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,799
hey that's a really nice watch where did

832
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,320
you get that

833
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,760
if that's the response they're looking

834
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,200
for they're going to engage

835
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
most of our images when approved by us

836
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,520
and posted by us are meant to affirm

837
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,480
something for us whether we're a good

838
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,640
person with good intentions or

839
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,679
fashionable or successful this gives us

840
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,600
an idea of who that person wants to be

841
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,279
seen as

842
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,440
in some cases they're actually posted so

843
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,600
that others will make those affirmations

844
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,880
for us to make us feel better

845
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,399
the added benefit is that we don't have

846
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,240
to stroke our own ego somebody does it

847
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,880
for us

848
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,000
next where are they

849
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,720
in a papal paper titled personality

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,080
commented this

853
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,919
researchers found that places can draw

854
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,760
out certain aspects of people's

855
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
personalities their data also showed

856
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
that people with certain personality

857
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,880
traits

858
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,679
are drawn to certain places

859
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,200
for example

860
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
people who tend to be more extroverted a

861
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,799
trait that reflects how sociable a

862
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,080
person is

863
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,399
spent more time in public places

864
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,360
compared to more introverted people

865
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,600
the findings also show that spending

866
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,399
time in a particular place predicts

867
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,600
people's momentary personality states

868
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
and their short-term trait expressions

869
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,440
over time

870
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,080
for example people reported feeling more

871
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,919
extroverted in the moments when spending

872
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,080
time at bars or parties cafes or

873
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,799
restaurants or friends houses compared

874
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,159
with when at home

875
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,000
so we relate this back to the group of

876
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
people who go out on friday night to the

877
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,399
work gathering for xyz corp we may have

878
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,240
some introverts

879
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,360
online

880
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,919
that are more extroverted at the bar we

881
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,840
can use that

882
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,080
and then lastly who

883
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,480
are they alone

884
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,240
maybe they're self-involved or maybe

885
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,880
they prefer being alone and having

886
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,279
social interaction at a distance which

887
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,159
we'll cover in just a few minutes

888
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,799
do they prefer pictures with friends

889
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,720
or groups of friends

890
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,640
does this accurately portray their

891
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,559
personality when compared to their words

892
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,320
and language yes we have to do a little

893
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,919
bit of comparison to get a full idea

894
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,120
is there a lack of images

895
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,640
not because they don't

896
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,559
interact on social media but maybe

897
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,559
because they prefer to experience life

898
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,039
rather than documented

899
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,440
all these things are discoverable in the

900
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,159
imagery on a on a social media site or a

901
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,399
website or a blog

902
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,279
or even in the lack of imagery

903
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,919
we just have to be looking for it

904
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,519
and still

905
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,000
says that selfies help people portray a

906
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,080
version of themselves to the world this

907
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,240
is state this is a statement that says

908
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,399
look at me this is who i am

909
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,399
she goes on to say that in real life

910
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,159
people are constantly trying to stand

911
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:50,880
out

912
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,519
whether it is by what they say or the

913
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,120
clothes that they wear

914
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,960
and the selfie is no different it's a

915
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,640
statement to the world it allows people

916
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,760
to stand out among the masses

917
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,640
so then lastly is interactions

918
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,559
how does the target handle conflict do

919
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,279
they rant how do they communicate over

920
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,880
overall

921
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,640
in our article the psychology behind

922
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,840
social media interactions leraz margalit

923
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,919
a customer experience psychologist

924
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,760
points out a few things about our online

925
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,120
behavior

926
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,840
the most important one to me was this

927
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,120
studies have found that day-to-day

928
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,960
interactions are based almost entirely

929
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,120
on non-verbal communication

930
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,399
when we interact with others we

931
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,399
continuously process wordless signals

932
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,320
like facial expressions

933
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,799
tone of voice gestures body language eye

934
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,799
contact and even the physical distance

935
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,080
between us

936
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,799
and the other person and you might be

937
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,960
thinking up i knew that

938
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,200
but she goes on to say this

939
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
people in online interactions

940
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,159
are much more casual because they do not

941
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,840
have to be attentive to each other's

942
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,519
signals verbal and symbolic feedback is

943
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,360
not immediate so there's no need to be

944
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,519
constantly aware of the other person's

945
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,159
responses

946
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,159
to me that's important because it says

947
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,080
that in online settings we have the

948
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,000
ability to communicate without the

949
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,760
direction interruption or even the

950
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,919
social guidance of others being in our

951
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,799
way

952
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,120
we can act and react and interact the

953
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,279
way that we truly see fit

954
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,880
in some cases removing the world's

955
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,279
influence on our personal behavior

956
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,880
that allows us to

957
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,200
express a stronger sense of who we are

958
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,360
to the core and allow that to shine

959
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,640
through

960
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
la raz finalizes the article by saying

961
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,519
this interactions via social media make

962
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,519
visitors feel connected

963
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,799
without the difficulties and

964
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,880
complexities of face-to-face interaction

965
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,000
now remember what i said about the

966
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,679
images if they're always alone in the

967
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,159
picture maybe they value interaction but

968
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,200
they don't have to deal with the

969
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,279
difficulties and complexities of

970
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,880
actually engaging you face to face

971
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,720
that's an important personality trait

972
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,840
that we need to be looking for

973
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,440
next is excitement

974
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,519
what excites the target what makes them

975
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,679
eager to talk in a positive or negative

976
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,679
light being angry is just excitement

977
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,918
just in a negative direction

978
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,839
do they like to drone on about subjects

979
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,679
that excite them do they like to rant

980
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,520
about things that anger them if so can

981
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,599
we use that

982
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,280
and then finally emotion

983
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,960
how do they react to emotional posts

984
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,040
whether it be positive or negative sad

985
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,239
or happy

986
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,918
what emotions are portrayed in their

987
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,960
imagery their words this isn't an

988
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,119
exact or accurate science but we can get

989
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,599
a sense of what makes them tick by

990
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,280
reading and studying the ways in which

991
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,760
they communicate with others on social

992
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,800
media

993
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,320
and even

994
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,239
how they want their onlookers to see

995
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,079
them through that communication maybe

996
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,760
they want to appear as a an empathetic

997
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
person

998
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,679
maybe they want to be seen as

999
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,920
emotionally connected or intelligent or

1000
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
knowledgeable or helpful maybe they want

1001
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,599
to be seen as the purveyor of political

1002
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,839
and economical knowledge

1003
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,200
maybe they like being known as the

1004
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,720
person who doesn't take anything from

1005
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,800
anybody

1006
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,480
those are all important things that we

1007
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,160
can pick up through their interactions

1008
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,040
their imagery and their language

1009
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,720
so we know why we should do this

1010
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,880
but why is it important to our social

1011
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,440
engineering engagements

1012
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
well

1013
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,440
elicitation influence persuasion

1014
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,960
techniques all of those things that you

1015
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,040
use in a social engineering engagement

1016
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,359
they become much easier to use when you

1017
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,760
better understand the target's needs

1018
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,680
wants and desires

1019
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,599
while it isn't always going to provide

1020
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,280
the fullest and most accurate picture of

1021
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
the target we can at least begin to

1022
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,119
understand them

1023
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,040
with an understanding of personalities

1024
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,920
likes dislikes and interactions we can

1025
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
build a more effective pretext

1026
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,079
and as we become more effective at

1027
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,200
identifying engaging and connecting

1028
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,800
with our targets in a more efficient

1029
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,560
manner

1030
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,480
we have the opportunity to first

1031
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,560
understand a bit about who they are and

1032
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,920
how they want to be seen and a little

1033
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
bit about how they want to be treated

1034
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,400
and then build an effective pretext or

1035
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,880
an effective engagement off of that

1036
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,200
overall we can build that advanced

1037
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,119
communication profile that we're looking

1038
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:19,920
for

1039
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,359
based on the information discovered

1040
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,960
during percent

1041
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,480
and have an upper hand when it comes to

1042
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,640
engaging the person of interest

1043
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,200
raising our chances at a successful

1044
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,680
engagement

1045
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,160
so here we are

1046
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,640
we know what we're looking for we know

1047
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,400
who we're looking at and now we've asked

1048
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
these basic questions and we're going to

1049
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,280
start digging

1050
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,040
so we dig in we scroll through facebook

1051
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,960
and instagram we understand the pictures

1052
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,720
and the personality

1053
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,520
what does it look like

1054
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,240
meet grant he's an open guy he's

1055
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,920
confident and sure of himself he accepts

1056
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,680
the consequences of his own actions he

1057
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,200
takes ownership

1058
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,680
he looks to resolve conflict and issues

1059
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,839
quickly

1060
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,520
he loves going out and meeting new

1061
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
people but finds comfort and comfort in

1062
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
the quietness of his own home

1063
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,280
he's an animal lover his dog recently

1064
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,880
passed away so he loves sitting at the

1065
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,720
dog park on sunday

1066
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,960
dog park on sundays to watch other dogs

1067
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,680
play it makes him feel better

1068
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
he's a member of the local country club

1069
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,280
and a running club and enjoys getting

1070
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,200
together with his local conservationist

1071
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,240
group

1072
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,160
he loves to rant about his job when

1073
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,079
angered he'd tell you all about the

1074
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,760
company process and how horrible it is

1075
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,800
he uses phrases like my team the guys my

1076
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,920
group relationships

1077
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,119
he only takes a selfie if friends are in

1078
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,800
it

1079
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,640
here's a personal blog where he likes to

1080
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,560
talk about the amazing experiences he

1081
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,160
has when he's traveling the world and

1082
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,200
things he's learned from his new job

1083
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,040
his pictures show that he's kind of

1084
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,000
messy

1085
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,359
and doesn't value organization

1086
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,240
leads to believing that he has a he's a

1087
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,640
bit open

1088
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,960
he's a visual communicator he uses

1089
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,520
phrases like i see what's going on here

1090
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
or imagine this

1091
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,680
he loves to be helpful sometimes to his

1092
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,440
own detriment he likes to show others

1093
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,119
that he's in control and really knows

1094
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,720
what's going on

1095
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,800
it makes him feel better as a person and

1096
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,560
he wants to share that with the world

1097
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,520
this information gives you insight

1098
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,640
into who grant is

1099
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,000
not just what he does or how he does it

1100
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,760
but who he is when he does it

1101
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,280
we could most certainly use this to

1102
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,240
to get an idea of how we should approach

1103
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,720
him this individualized information

1104
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,880
gives us an idea

1105
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,839
of

1106
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,160
how to connect with grant and gain

1107
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,319
further information or at the very least

1108
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,839
gain interaction

1109
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,359
i'll leave you with this because this is

1110
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,800
one of the most common questions that i

1111
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,040
get about any se technique and that's

1112
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,200
how do you practice it well like

1113
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,880
any other sc technique or ocean

1114
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,800
technique or tactic it does require

1115
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,560
practice and you can practice in almost

1116
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,079
any setting

1117
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,680
you have friends with social media take

1118
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,760
a scroll see if your ideas of their

1119
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,920
personality line up with what you find

1120
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,400
when you're around them listen

1121
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,160
see if you can pick up on the social

1122
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,839
cues that you've seen in their online

1123
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,480
interactions

1124
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,040
matthew lieberman in his book social why

1125
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,119
our brains are wired to connect says

1126
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,960
this to the extent that we can

1127
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,680
characterize evolution as designing our

1128
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,240
modern brains this is what our brains

1129
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,000
were wired for

1130
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,839
reaching out

1131
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,640
and interacting with others

1132
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,079
these social adaptations are central to

1133
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,720
making us the most successful species

1134
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
on earth

1135
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,480
and with that

1136
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,880
i'll take questions
