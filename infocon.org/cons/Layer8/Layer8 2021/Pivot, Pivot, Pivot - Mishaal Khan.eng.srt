1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,080
hi everyone i am excited to demo today

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,639
one of the most important ocean

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,200
methodologies to find someone

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,040
called pivoting

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,320
most of you are probably aware of this

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,800
but i'm going to show you an example of

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,359
how to do this agenda is simple we start

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,599
with a piece of information

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,039
we pivot off of that we get more info we

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,679
pivot off of that and rinse and repeat

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,200
we keep doing it

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,680
until we find what we are looking for

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,840
a little bit about myself

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,640
you already probably know you can oh

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,879
send me i won't bore you with all of

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,079
this

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,559
but before i start

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,719
just a disclaimer every time we do

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
something of this nature we make sure we

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,160
cover our tracks

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,320
by using stock puppet accounts that's

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,800
probably the most important one

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,840
vpns alias accounts let's not leave our

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,119
tracks

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,760
to the bad guys

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
let's jump straight into this

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
the way i start usually these

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,040
presentations is i

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
open up a notepad

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,880
and i

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,759
open up a browser window i've

32
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,759
pre-populated some of these things

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,640
and i start noting things down you know

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
pretty raw

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,680
way of doing it but this is the fastest

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,960
way and then i formalize it later on

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,680
so we start with a target now every time

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
i've done this uh it's it's hard to do

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,360
ocean without doxing a person i usually

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,759
pick a public figure or celebrity or a

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,520
politician and there's enough

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,759
information about them so it's easier to

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,720
demo

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
uh for this for for the purposes of

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,960
pivoting let's let's choose an actual

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,680
target which no one will

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,119
mind

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,280
if we kind of

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,159
dox in a way so let's look at uh

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,200
i don't know

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,079
top

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,439
10

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,399
sex

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,080
offenders

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,480
let's say wanted

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,319
a wanted list

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
let's see what comes up let's click on

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
the first link

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,599
and we find texas's 10 most wanted sex

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,040
offenders

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
there's some reward for some of these

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
some have been captured let's pick on

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,480
this guy here

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
william daniel clifford three thousand

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,120
dollar reward

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,879
what's his offense

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,760
he is he failed to register as a sex

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,959
offender

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
um

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,360
born in louisiana some basic information

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,239
here out of texas aggravated assault to

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:46,959
a

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,000
child

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,720
um

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,239
yes a lot of

76
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,640
bad stuff so he served some time in jail

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
but now there's a reward for his capture

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
okay what what seed information do we

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,080
have here we have a full name

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,800
let's start with that i'll copy paste

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,879
that in he has a very common name so

82
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,640
it's going to be a little bit difficult

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,360
to find and there's texas here so we

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
know this person is in texas that's

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
pretty much it uh from here on i would

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,920
look at multiple pictures

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,800
here's a way to pivot off of i'll take

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,879
the first picture and i'll go through

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
something called

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
demise which is a reverse

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
image search

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,519
using some ai and that will be my first

93
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
start because i have a picture so now i

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,280
have certain different types of pictures

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,040
which weren't in

96
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,159
this one

97
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,360
so

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
mugshots.com i can see here it says

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,720
mugshots.com so let's go to mugshots.com

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
and let's put in

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,000
his name here so this is our first pivot

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,920
off of a name

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
very quickly we find the same person

104
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,360
same information let's see

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,599
got a date of birth height where none of

106
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
that that is going to help us

107
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,599
you notice 8 10 1973

108
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,680
here the date of birth was 8 10 1971 so

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,239
slightly different

110
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,320
this needs to be verified so you can't

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,639
trust everything you see

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,959
online so we'll just note this down as

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
well

114
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,600
so we have some conflicting information

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
doesn't matter

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,919
what else do we have we have an address

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
longview texas

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,759
so let's replace this with something

119
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
more accurate now we're getting more and

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,479
more information same thing aggravated

121
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,800
sexual assault of a minor

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,759
and so yeah so from this

123
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
point onwards i would verify some of his

124
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,400
information since this is legal info i

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
would go to a site like

126
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
judy records put in his full name

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
a place longview texas click on search

128
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,360
i should find you know official records

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,240
harris county so i now i now know which

130
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
county issued this

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,800
arrest or bond or whatever this is

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,280
so here it has a 1971 date of birth

133
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,759
that's more accurate

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,360
same offense here let's see if we can

135
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,000
find something else a phone number no

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,120
a different address no same long view

137
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
texas

138
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
list of his stuff if i had time i would

139
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,880
go over all of these things

140
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,479
but now i need to verify this

141
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,479
information so i would go to harris

142
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,639
county's website

143
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
which is here have pre-loaded this go

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,120
under criminal record cases

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,000
and just use their own search criteria

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,880
to

147
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,000
find and dig deeper into this

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,440
case so i would go under defendant and

149
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,160
was his name

150
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,199
last name so last name was

151
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
clifford first name william

152
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
search

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,600
and now i'm sort of verifying these

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
things using government records not just

155
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,520
any website so i guess they scraped it

156
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,680
off of here i'm looking for additional

157
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,240
information maybe a full address

158
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
something else not here okay moving on

159
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,479
now we use people search websites like

160
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,960
advancedbackgroundchecks.com

161
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,720
or

162
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,199
i use used herefastpeoplesearch.com

163
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,000
so someone once asked me uh

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,479
fast people uh what's that one website

165
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,720
you use to find people all their

166
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,360
information i'm like that doesn't exist

167
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,120
uh we pivot off of information and uh

168
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
this is how we find stuff

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,639
so

170
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,840
if any website i usually start with

171
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,400
fastpeoplesearch.com or advanced

172
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,120
background checks or

173
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,199
anything similar so

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
we searched the same name here we know

175
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,360
location now we're trying to find more

176
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
information

177
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
here so we see

178
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,680
farmwell saratoga this is likely the

179
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
same person

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
let's look at this

181
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,919
now here there's a separate address

182
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,319
there's this texas

183
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,880
um i saw this before

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,240
some of his

185
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,880
relatives are here i would probably note

186
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,840
these down alicia

187
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,680
jessica because i'm going to need this

188
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,880
later on

189
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,199
billy messer messer a lot of the same

190
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,599
surname here

191
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,560
we have a secondary address in

192
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,360
louisiana i note that down as well

193
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,599
that'll be another pivot i have a phone

194
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,919
number but it says

195
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,479
2005 landline probably not too useful

196
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,199
but you know i'll put it here as well

197
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,919
can be used as a pivot

198
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,280
po box is useless to me so using people

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
search websites

200
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,639
again another one true people search i

201
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,720
can get a lot more information this is

202
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,639
the same address i had same phone number

203
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,360
previous addresses are useful laneville

204
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,599
saratoga uh

205
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
i i note down all these things and i

206
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,919
load down note down possible

207
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,240
um associates these people will help me

208
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,599
pivot even further through relatives

209
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
i can't find much more and i've done a

210
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,680
bit of search on this i can't find a

211
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,919
real phone number or an email address or

212
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,120
anything else

213
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,759
maybe he's just not online as much

214
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,319
take the address the phone number i have

215
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,240
this would be my next

216
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,279
pivot point i would put this in a tool

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,240
like this online search tool

218
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,559
look that up and i see

219
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,599
cold spring texas so his name does not

220
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,958
really pop up

221
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,320
um something generic i try a more

222
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,360
um

223
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,800
legitimate data look up like uh twilio

224
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,040
enter the same phone number here

225
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,600
and i get a slightly different name

226
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,480
shield dev corp again not his name it's

227
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,040
a business name but anyways i'll put

228
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,399
this up in my notes i may spot it

229
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,640
somewhere else later on

230
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,880
next when i've done all this initial

231
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,240
search

232
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
i don't have a lot of information here

233
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,680
but i have enough pivot points any one

234
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,920
of these can now be another branch that

235
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
i can go off to

236
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,720
i would next go to facebook and i would

237
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
search

238
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,560
his name and his name is kind of common

239
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,680
william

240
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
and i don't expect to see immediate

241
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,130
results but i have

242
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,279
[Music]

243
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,279
some some information so i know he's in

244
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,480
longview

245
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
texas or at least that was one of his

246
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,760
addresses

247
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,720
three names is usually not as common on

248
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,040
facebook or any social media so i'll

249
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,320
remove those

250
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,880
i still don't see it here there's

251
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
definitely hundreds of people with that

252
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,760
name

253
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,480
let's

254
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
narrow it down to a city longview texas

255
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
and i get exactly one so maybe i got

256
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,040
lucky a long view let's see if this is

257
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
the same person

258
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,680
high chances this is

259
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,519
someone else but

260
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,560
redneck okay

261
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,079
another place wath texas i'll note that

262
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,959
down as well here

263
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,200
another place to look for and he only

264
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
has one friend

265
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,160
um christopher let's go down this

266
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,240
profile hasn't been updated in a in a

267
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
while 2016 so it's not

268
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,920
too useful but again it's a pivot point

269
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,880
um the first ever post was i need a pass

270
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,040
on a criminal case so this is likely the

271
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,519
same person

272
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,880
and another possible pivot point so from

273
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,000
the profile we don't get a lot only one

274
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,079
person but we're kind of sure this is

275
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,600
the same

276
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,360
guy we're looking for

277
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,680
so the only one other pivot point in

278
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,079
this profile is now

279
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,160
this person here and another image here

280
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,519
let's start with

281
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,399
uh

282
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,240
his only friend

283
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,880
christopher clifford now instead of

284
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,760
going through all of this again

285
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,079
let's look at his friends

286
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,880
so if you look at his friends underneath

287
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,519
let's see if there is

288
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,160
another william no maybe another

289
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,320
uh clifford uh there's jessica this uh

290
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
some of these names showed up here jesse

291
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,279
billy um

292
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,839
a lot of them are common here so let's

293
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,640
click

294
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,120
on the first one so another pivot point

295
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
a friend of a friend with the same

296
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,000
surname likely related so now this

297
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,800
person michael um similar

298
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,279
stays in us in texas

299
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,360
um instead of getting into his life

300
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,480
let's get into his friends further

301
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,160
now let's search for

302
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,120
uh

303
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
you know his friends and family

304
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,760
same surname so jessica is likely you

305
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,519
know related

306
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,839
i look at other stuff like

307
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,680
there's a name messer

308
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,600
kept coming up in in this list as well

309
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
a lot of people with that name

310
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,079
this name has the word cliff messer this

311
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,279
kind of looks

312
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,040
um odd

313
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,480
is this our guy

314
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,040
let's see cliff messer

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680

316
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,239

this is one of his pictures now does

318
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,959
this picture look like

319
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,639
the mug shot here

320
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,440
pretty much one eye is a little

321
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,680
there's something wrong with it mustache

322
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,720
with some facial hair below the

323
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,440
below the lower lip if i look at this

324
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,160
one

325
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
same thing the eye has an issue same

326
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
type of facial hair this is the same

327
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,600
person

328
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,399
um

329
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
some other picture he has of a child

330
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,880
here probably related

331
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,320
this image not pretty

332
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,040
well um not good quality

333
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
a car likely his

334
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,639
own vehicle

335
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,760

now we have a vehicle now we can write

337
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,440
that down okay

338
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,160
mustang and another ford truck in the

339
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,959
back

340
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,560
people usually take pictures of their

341
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,160
own

342
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,680
cars another possible pivot point julie

343
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
we can now look into

344
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,320
her life and see but anyways we have

345
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,079
this person's

346
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,279
primary

347
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,440
profile now now let's see when it was

348
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,639
updated pretty recent september 23rd so

349
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,320
a couple of um

350
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,399
days ago

351
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,040
and says in a relationship

352
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,440
uh if you keep reading through comments

353
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,600
you'll see hey did i see you at fuel max

354
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,720
okay so he's active he's around and

355
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,160
where is he lives in lufkin texas

356
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,079
well this thing now

357
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,040
is your primary location here lufkin

358
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,560
texas no longer the rest of them

359
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
and now you start getting much more

360
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
information on who he knows doesn't have

361
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,120
a lot of friends 136

362
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,440
some of the same names pop up

363
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,399
um

364
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,440
billy jesse messer all these were

365
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,560
initial

366
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
names that we had so now we have a

367
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
fairly good idea who he hangs out with

368
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,320
where he is from a city perspective some

369
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,519
of his latest images

370
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
so we pretty much

371
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,279
have narrowed it down

372
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,720
next thing is we still don't have an

373
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,959
email or a phone number

374
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,920
um

375
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,959
there's one way to kind of

376
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,160
guess some of these things so let's

377
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
let's let's guess it he doesn't put it

378
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,360
anywhere but we have a

379
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
profile name here we can search for

380
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,199
different types of profiles

381
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,600
like a linkedin or

382
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,760
instagram and stuff with the same name

383
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,440
or we could try something that's

384
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,480
frowned down upon on the ocean community

385
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,079
password reset

386
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,399
i'm going to do it anyways

387
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,120
but

388
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,079
if

389
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,680
be careful when you do these things

390
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,720
because the person sometimes finds out

391
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,320
if you do it wrong you need to know when

392
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
and where to do it facebook doesn't

393
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,079
inform the person you can simply do a

394
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,079
search and then back out of the search

395
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,880
and say oh it's not me so this way at

396
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
least i got

397
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,440
a partial email address so i know now

398
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,279
whatever email i find in the future it

399
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,279
starts with an m ends with a 9

400
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,600
and it's a gmail

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,639
add

402
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,680
gmail one more possible pivot point

403
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,120
phone number ends in an 89

404
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,920
so that i write down as well maybe later

405
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,320
on i find a bunch of phone numbers i can

406
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,240
narrow it down to this one specifically

407
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,279
or i could search in a breach and see

408
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,720
if that brings me any hits that's as far

409
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
as i need to go don't go any further

410
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,839
than this

411
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,519
but i also had um

412
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,320
let's go one step back

413
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,199
his username so cliff messer that's an

414
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,519
alternate name he goes by initially he

415
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,399
was william daniel clifford so let's add

416
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,160
that as a new name to if messer let's

417
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,439
search this on

418
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,639
instagram so let's open up instagram and

419
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,040
search for cliff messer

420
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,480
very quickly you see there's a lot of

421
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,720
cliff messers but

422
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,880
i've identified the third option here is

423
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,720
this little child

424
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,880
let's click on that that little child's

425
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,680
image holding crayons i guess was the

426
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,839
same image

427
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,880
in his photo stream here

428
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,079
this one

429
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,040
so these two things tie him together and

430
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,079
now we've pivoted onto instagram without

431
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,800
even going you know too deep

432
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,639
into the search he only has three

433
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,720
followers two following we can go deeper

434
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,680
but now this instagram profile is

435
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,959
something that's

436
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,519
kind of verified so now we put this in

437
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,359
now we have two more pivot points here

438
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,400
um

439
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,959
instagram profile and you know phone

440
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,919
number and partial uh redacted phone

441
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,559
number and gmail

442
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,039
let's look at the gmail address it's a m

443
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,000
star star whatever a nine

444
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,799
let's

445
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,400
let's see if i can

446
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,160
guess this so

447
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,400
if i were to put that

448
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,280
in here let's do a facebook search again

449
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,160
uh

450
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,559
his username was

451
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
cliff messer

452
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
starts with an m so this is likely

453
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,480
m-e-s-s-e-r messer and then something

454
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,720
nine um

455
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
probably

456
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,559
cliff

457
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,280
let's do this and put this in

458
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,880
sometimes you can guess and get away

459
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,400
with it

460
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,760
and in this case

461
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,080
messer cliff 9.

462
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,880
nope

463
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,679
so that's probably not the right yes

464
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,320
it says put in a mobile number but

465
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,679
actually it is so let's see what i did a

466
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,160
messer cliff

467
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,440
nine at gmail.com

468
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,120
so this was the right guess actually uh

469
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
so it kind of verifies that yep you got

470
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,960
an email address i still don't have a

471
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,039
phone number so i got lucky there but

472
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,720
that's one thing so now that i know an

473
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,559
email address let's quickly go to

474
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,760
havewidebinpone.com and see is this

475
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
email address part of any

476
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,559
oops part of any breach

477
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,880
and that would give us further pivot

478
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,640
points maybe it's part of a known breach

479
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
that i have

480
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,039
oh good news no bonus so unfortunately

481
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,880
he's not part of a brief so this pivot

482
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,559
did not work

483
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
if if it did then i would have looked up

484
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,200
my data breaches and found out more info

485
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
so we're at a dead end at instagram and

486
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,880
there's still maybe a lot more to do on

487
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,600
the facebook side but at this point

488
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,520
since we have an email let's take that

489
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,000
as another pivot point and search

490
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,559
further so that's his email address

491
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,440
there's

492
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,640
a tool online that'll search through

493
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,360
gmail and figure out if

494
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
there's anything related in terms of

495
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,520
maps or calendars or gmail photos and

496
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,039
stuff so let's search through that api

497
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,919
and see if that gmail is

498
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,200
gmail account has any further

499
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,840
information behind it

500
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,200
so it

501
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,880
gave me some results i think um

502
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
said account was not found let's let's

503
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
try that again i think i have to refresh

504
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,720
the page

505
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,000
so the gmail account definitely exists

506
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
and the search will bring up something

507
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,039
in a bit

508
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,080
not found

509
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,600
let's search this again

510
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,559
make sure i'm not a robot

511
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,039
and let's see what okay so here's the

512
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,159
results

513
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,840
there is a gmail account there's a

514
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
google id

515
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
here associated with this account let's

516
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,480
put that in here and the name kind of

517
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,280
verifies it is this person are there any

518
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,400
mapping locations related to this

519
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,880
let's check

520
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,840
no

521
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,159
so another dead end

522
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,679
but this could have been pretty valuable

523
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,840
if this person had checked in or left a

524
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,919
review using their google account we

525
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,960
would have

526
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,200
pretty much seen it here so we didn't

527
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,720
find anything there

528
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,320
there's another tool you can use for

529
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,400
instagram

530
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
is to find out what phone number is

531
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
behind this without doing a password

532
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,799
reset because this is one of the

533
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,799
dangerous ones don't do a password reset

534
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,200
on instagram because they

535
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,840
get a notification that that can kind of

536
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,640
blow your cover so there's a tool called

537
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,240
two tatis

538
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,200
by megadose thank you for that tool

539
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
and what it does is it takes an

540
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
instagram username

541
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,960
and

542
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,120
pulls some information through the api

543
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,360
around the account so it pulled

544
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,400
information

545
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
his full name came up which was public

546
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,520
anyways

547
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,080
this obfuscated phone number wasn't so

548
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,960
it ends in an 89 which is

549
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,000
the same one we had here 89 so kind of

550
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,159
verified both these accounts are the

551
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,640
same person it was verified anyways from

552
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
the picture but now we have some more

553
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,640
information sometimes this gives an

554
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
email or some other hidden information

555
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,159
this time it didn't

556
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,840
another tool that's by the same person

557
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,919
is holi

558
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,520
and it tells you if this gmail address

559
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,480
was ever used to create other accounts

560
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,080
other accounts we may not know of so it

561
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,240
brings a lot of other accounts tries to

562
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,360
sign up

563
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,919
and gives you the results in this case

564
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,760
google was the only one

565
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,320
so another dead end here

566
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
but we need to try all these avenues

567
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,679
so very quickly we kind of

568
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,679
demonstrated on how

569
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,960
to

570
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
locate a person

571
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
by continuously pivoting off of things

572
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
and the last one i'll

573
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,000
i'll try is you know try to sign in and

574
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,720
again don't do a password reset here

575
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,039
don't go through all the way but since

576
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,200
we have this information let's see if we

577
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,640
can get some more information from this

578
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,360
so if i try to sign in with this i won't

579
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,760
obviously it's illegal don't sign into

580
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,480
accounts you're not authorized to but if

581
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,880
i don't know the password for this i can

582
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
say let me try another way

583
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
and i didn't really reset it yet and

584
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,080
this is as far as you should go but i

585
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
found some more information that there's

586
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,640
an lg k

587
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,679
31 phone let's put that in here that

588
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,840
this person is using so it's not an

589
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
iphone that's about it i'm not going to

590
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,559
go any further but if you go back to

591
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,320
this person's

592
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,520
pictures

593
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,799
let's see if we can figure out if

594
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,960
there's a phone here

595
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,799
and if you go to the posts

596
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,280
there's something called collections

597
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,080
images here

598
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,600
maybe this picture can be geo-located

599
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,039
there's an image right here

600
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,720
and someone else here i don't see an

601
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,400
image of

602
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,200
a phone or a screenshot

603
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,440
actually here i do so this picture that

604
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
he posted

605
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,880
kind of shows you the battery percentage

606
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,039
and stuff this doesn't

607
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,960
look like an iphone and it doesn't also

608
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,000
tell you the

609
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
mobile phone provider um

610
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
but it does give you an idea that this

611
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,600
is likely android and this lg k31 kind

612
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,159
of confirmed that and it's putting two

613
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,840
and two together

614
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
at the end of the day

615
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
you keep pivoting until you find the

616
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
information you are looking for

617
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,159
and

618
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,600
you know we want to be

619
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,000
eventually in a place where we've tried

620
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,679
all different avenues

621
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,159
and we start piecing the puzzles

622
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,120
together uh we pivot we keep pivoting

623
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,799
and then one information leads to the

624
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,440
other and this can become a nice big web

625
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
of information of relatives phone

626
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,279
numbers

627
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,159
emails addresses businesses

628
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,840
you name it and then start connecting

629
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
the dots like these yellow dashed lines

630
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,159
that this information was gotten from

631
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,000
here or this phone number connects to

632
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,360
this account

633
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,039
the more connections you have the more

634
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,640
solid evidence it becomes and eventually

635
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,960
you exhaust all possibilities and you

636
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,559
also

637
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,720
accomplish your goals

638
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,120
at this point i would take all the case

639
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,840
information i have compile it

640
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
and provide it to

641
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,600
the appropriate law enforcement

642
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,760
authorities they can now take this

643
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,640
further and do the rest of this stuff

644
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,559
like maybe issue a search warrant or a

645
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,400
subpoena against

646
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,520
facebook

647
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,440
to get the actual number

648
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
against gmail to find out where they

649
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,159
last logged in from that ip address and

650
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
then they can pivot from there get the

651
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,760
ip address find out who the isp was and

652
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
then ask the isp what their home

653
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,400
location was and in a matter of days

654
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,760
you've located the person with a couple

655
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
of pivots

656
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,880
this methodology works pretty well it

657
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,840
but you have to start off with a goal uh

658
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,240
your goal cannot be broad um i hate when

659
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,679
people tell me find out everything you

660
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,440
can about this person now what are you

661
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,080
trying to find a location a car his

662
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,799
phone number his whatever is how are

663
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,640
they related there has to be some little

664
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,760
goal involved to work towards otherwise

665
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,679
it's it's um

666
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,960
it's never ending

667
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
think outside the box and you know think

668
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,520
different document everything this comes

669
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,360
with a lot of experience

670
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,080
but as you can see in this short demo if

671
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,919
you continue with persistence and

672
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,080
perseverance leave no stone unturned

673
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,159
there's hundreds and hundreds of places

674
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,440
to find stuff

675
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,520
your chances of success are going to be

676
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,120
immense

677
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,840
and have a positive attitude

678
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,000
when i can't find something i take a

679
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,880
rest i come back with a fresh mind and

680
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,039
suddenly new pieces of information pop

681
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:35,760
up

682
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,240
so there can be a lot of fatigue in this

683
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,520
so have patience and keep pivoting and

684
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
the most important thing is verify the

685
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,840
information don't trust everything you

686
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
see on the internet and the more you

687
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,120
verify the the better it is and just

688
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,960
keep pivoting

689
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,200
thank you
