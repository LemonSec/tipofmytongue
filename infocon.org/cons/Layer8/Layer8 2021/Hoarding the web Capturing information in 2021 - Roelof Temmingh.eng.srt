1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,320
hi there my name is roloff timming today

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,880
i'm going to talk to you about saving

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,639
web pages capturing web pages

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,320
putting web pages onto your computer

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
uh first i'm going to tell you just a

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,119
little bit about myself i'm from south

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,720
africa

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,039
i studied electronic engineering that

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,640
sucked

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,320
it was really difficult i don't know why

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,599
i did that

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,399
um

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,800
after that i started a company called

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,480
sensepost

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,840
which is now orange cyber defense

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,800
um with charleston vault

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,000
i was there for seven years uh doing pen

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,120
testing

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,000
and

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,879
breaking into things and then

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,199
after that i started the company called

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,559
paterva

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
which is um

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
better known for making a

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
a product called multigo

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
i ran that company for 10 years and

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
then i left and then i started voting

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,840
which is

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,000
what i'm doing right now and what this

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
is all about

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,799
and if you add all of those years you

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,320
get 20 years which is a lot of years

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,920
which makes me officially old

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
so my background is in i.t security and

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,200
software and osn

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
and that's kind of what i do

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,119
okay so

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,119
today i want to talk about the capturing

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,799
mechanism within votimo right

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,320
so demo does a whole lot of different

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,079
things

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
but one of the things that it also is

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
doing is capturing web pages capturing

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,399
web pages to your local computer

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,920
and we set a pretty

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
difficult criteria for doing this like

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,000
firstly

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
we wanted to save these pages all the

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,079
time so it's not just when the user

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,920
click on save the page or something like

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
this it should automatically save the

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
pages whenever

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,919
you browsing the web right um and it has

54
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,319
to work for all sites it can't just work

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,520
well for

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,840
like certain sites it has to work for

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,560
all sites which is a difficult thing to

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,280
do because we don't have all sites

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
and it needs to be

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,400
automatic unattended like i said um and

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,480
it needs to be unintrusive and i mean

62
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
unintrusive as in

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
it can't be too difficult

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,440
uh

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,200
it can't be too hard on the computer to

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
do it so we can't have

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
uh crazy cpu

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,599
resources or disk space

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,519
you know it can't be like every time you

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,080
browse somewhere it's you know five gigs

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
of data that's been stored

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,440
and it has to be completely local so no

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,120
cloud stuff and the reason for that is

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,480
basically because

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
a lot of people are kind of uh sensitive

76
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,920
about

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,760
sending things to the cloud

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,519
and um

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,959
they can't send you know investigations

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
up to the cloud that's the start is

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,440
so we're going to use a bit of

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,680
terminology in here the first is a

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,800
snapshot and a snapshot is really

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,440
uh the web page in mhml we're going to

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
talk about that later

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
plus the text on the site plus what the

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
site looked like like a snapshot like a

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,519
jpeg

89
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,519
picture of what the site looks like and

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,360
a visit is really

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,959
that snapshot during a certain time

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,599
on a certain url

93
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,319
and scroll down a scroll position that

94
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,760
says how far on this thing have we

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,680
scrolled down and you'll see why that's

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,200
kind of important to us later on

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,879
now

98
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,799
when you attack this problem you say we

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,280
need to solve the problem of

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,120
um

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280
being able to properly write

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,799
web pages to

103
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,840
your

104
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,959
hard drive

105
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,360
was a criteria that we explained

106
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,120
these are the tools that are available

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
to us to detect this problem um we

108
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,840
decided to do it in chromium

109
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
chromium browsers because there's a lot

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,560
more

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
tools available

112
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,239
and we're going to use a lot of the apis

113
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,840
all right so the the calls that we're

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,639
going to utilize is one to save a web

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,079
page as mhtml and mhtml

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,560
is basically just like this portable

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
web page it means if you take a web page

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,520
and you save it as an html file you can

119
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,199
give it to someone else and it will

120
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,800
contain all the images and all the css

121
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,840
and the html and everything to basically

122
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,240
re-render that page again

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
most importantly it does not contain the

124
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,440
javascript

125
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
so it doesn't contain the javascript

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,960
that's on the page but it gives you the

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
ability to re-render the site

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
on your browser the way that it was

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
right

130
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
we also get a

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,199
jpeg of the rendered window so we can

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,639
basically

133
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,120
see what it looked like right

134
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,759
and we can pause the dom now the dom is

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,280
the the

136
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,199
what is the document object model which

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,039
is basically the page

138
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,880
the document

139
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
and so we can pause that entire thing

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
and we can get

141
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
the text from it

142
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,960
so there's a lot of

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,639
commonly used libraries available to

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,320
just pause

145
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,080
a web page for text that's what you do

146
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,240
so we see the text that's on the screen

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,919
so we have the text

148
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,840
we have the picture what it looks like

149
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
and we got all the css

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,320
we got the images and everything to

151
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,560
basically reconstruct that page that's

152
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
what we get from the browser we don't

153
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,159
need to do any of that work right

154
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,919
and you'll see that

155
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,440
uh there's basically we said level one

156
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,160
to seven you know there's a whole lot of

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,880
different pages on the internet

158
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,000
and how they construct differ between

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,919
different sites you get something that's

160
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,280
really simple html

161
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,160
you get pages that are mostly html

162
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,400
but that are also populated with

163
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
javascript

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,960
uh

165
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,720
for some parts and then pages that are

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,800
mostly just javascript and a little bit

167
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,440
of html and a lot of css

168
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,240
then you get infinite scrollers

169
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
you get infinite scrollers that unload

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
stuff at the bot at the top we're gonna

171
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
talk about that a lot

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,960
um

173
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,280
you get reverse infinite scrollers like

174
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
telegram

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,440
um

176
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,919
and you know who knows one day we're

177
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,440
gonna have like you know

178
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,080
some pages with side scrollers and

179
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
narrow link and

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
holographic displays and then maybe

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,479
we'll have a patch for whatever that we

182
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,440
can

183
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,479
we can also index those pages

184
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,080
now okay what are the parameters that we

185
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,919
get from from from the chromium browser

186
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,080
we get the url

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
we get a whole lot of information about

188
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,919
the tab so

189
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
we get the tab id

190
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,440
we get when we we get notified if the

191
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,599
tab is open or when a new one is when a

192
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,440
new one is open or when the tab is

193
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,560
closed

194
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,759
um there's this thing called the

195
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,000
document ready state flag

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
which

197
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
we're going to talk about just now

198
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,400
we have a thing that's called the dom

199
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
mutation observer which sounds like a

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,520
horror movie but really what it is is um

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,680
it tells us when the page

202
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
have changed that when the when the dom

203
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,800
has changed right

204
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
we get the window size and the page size

205
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
which you'll see later on is pretty

206
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
important to us right

207
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,759
and we get like we said in the past then

208
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,880
html jpeg and the text

209
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
right so now let's see how can we put

210
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,599
these things together

211
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,599
in a way that we can

212
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,080
save pages with all of the criteria that

213
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,520
we discussed in the past

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,199
okay so now the first thing uh that you

215
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,599
kind of got to consider is when to save

216
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,039
the page

217
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,160
so you would think that it's pretty easy

218
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,759
you look at the document ready state

219
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,000
flag and

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,240
when that flag is when that flag drop it

221
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,000
basically tells us all the content is

222
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,400
loaded the page is now good to go and

223
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,240
then you save the page

224
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,280
and it kind of works but it works for a

225
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,599
very small percentage of the internet

226
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,960
basically it works for any kind of

227
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,919
static html site but as soon as there's

228
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
javascript involved

229
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,719
uh

230
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,279
it's just it doesn't work anymore

231
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,760
and the reason for that is because the

232
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,679
page might be finished loading but the

233
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,919
javascript loads content into the page

234
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,919
much later right

235
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,880
so

236
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,160
you take a snaps a snapshot of a blank

237
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
screen

238
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,160
the content isn't loaded yet

239
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,000
so as a start what we need to do is we

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,760
need to wait a little bit

241
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,399
before we uh

242
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,920
before we

243
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,760
basically take the snapshot when the

244
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,839
document ready stage flag drops you got

245
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,000
to wait a bit and then take the snapshot

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
but

247
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,720
if you know anything about programming

248
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
you'll know that hard coding a value

249
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
like that is a really bad idea because

250
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
what happens if it takes a little bit

251
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,000
longer to load the javascript that for

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,040
the javascript to load the content then

253
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
you basically take a snapshot of a blank

254
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
page again right so

255
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,160
it's not a great idea to only rely on a

256
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,399
delay after

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,360
you save the p after the after the

258
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,160
ready stage flag is dropped right we

259
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,560
have it but you'll see that we use a

260
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,800
whole lot of other things as well

261
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
and here you can see what it looks like

262
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,800
when you basically take a snapshot of an

263
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,399
empty page this is what it looks like on

264
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,920
twitter

265
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
twitter is it does a whole lot of crazy

266
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,279
 and

267
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,399
if you're just waiting for the release

268
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,160
date flag to drop you'll take a blank

269
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,839
picture right

270
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,640
okay

271
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,279
now let's talk about dominations right

272
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,600
so you might say well i've got a

273
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
different idea my other idea is let's

274
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,399
just see

275
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,959
if there's dominations and when there's

276
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,360
no more dominations then we know that

277
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
the page is now in a stable

278
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
kind of form and then we can take a

279
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,200
snapshot because nothing else has to

280
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,760
load and that's that seems like a great

281
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,880
idea but your user can go to the site

282
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
and as soon as this he goes into the

283
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,399
site he starts scrolling down on the

284
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,399
site and then the domination is

285
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,399
basically just like going like

286
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,519
flickering on and off all the time right

287
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,640
so

288
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,720
then you can say well but maybe that's

289
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,880
not such a big bad idea and then it's

290
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,440
not such a big deal because

291
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,519
we can just override that visit every

292
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,480
time

293
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
so we overwrite the visit every time and

294
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,480
there's more information as he scrolls

295
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
down the page gets bigger and there's

296
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,440
more information and we basically just

297
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,000
overwrite the we overwrite this every

298
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
time but that

299
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,200
is a lot of um that that that is

300
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
resource intensive right to save the

301
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,320
file is a lot of work um and so we don't

302
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,839
want to save the file all the time so

303
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,519
what we're going to do what we have as a

304
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,360
start is we have this thing called

305
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,519
um a throttle that basically says

306
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,440
you can only save the file

307
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
once in

308
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
in this case three and a half seconds

309
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,360
right you can't override it all the time

310
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,200
you can't be overriding the file ten

311
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,240
times a second you can only do it once

312
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,560
and the default is

313
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,079
3520 seconds right

314
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,320
and it has that effect of of a low pass

315
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,880
filter it's basically saying this when

316
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,800
that when that

317
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,360
flag when that event fires like five

318
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,120
times in a row we're only going to fire

319
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,839
it one time right

320
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,720
okay

321
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,440
so

322
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,680
it now becomes a situation of when to

323
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,560
create a new visit and when to overwrite

324
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
the old visit

325
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,639
okay

326
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,440
so

327
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,279
let's think about what we have so far we

328
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,480
say

329
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,600
if it's a new visit when the tab id

330
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,959
change so

331
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,760
you know we open up a new tab

332
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,200
then we have to create a new visit we

333
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
can't overwrite the old one because

334
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
you'll be overriding

335
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,839
the previous

336
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,000
you know page that you've been to

337
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
or when the url changes

338
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
which seems like a good idea

339
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,200
or

340
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,519
when there's content unloaded

341
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,200
and we're gonna talk about that a little

342
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,040
bit later what happens when content gets

343
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,240
unloaded

344
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,600
but for

345
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,079
everything else we overwrite the visit

346
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,760
given the restrictions that we've now

347
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,519
had like a low-pass filter on um you

348
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,760
know saving the page

349
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,839
all the time on dom mutations and on the

350
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,760
ready state when the release date is

351
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,880
dropped after a certain while time given

352
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
all of those restrictions

353
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
we will overwrite the visit every time

354
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,720
and that seemed to be okay um

355
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
and you know that would be the end of

356
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,480
the talk but it's but it's not because

357
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
there's this thing called um infinite

358
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,760
scrollers

359
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,320
and an infinite scroll is basically load

360
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
content at the bottom

361
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
as soon as you hit the bottom of the of

362
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,399
the page right

363
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,079
and that triggers the

364
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,160
documentation event which is now the

365
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
page has changed right

366
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,680
and the ready state flag changes and you

367
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,600
know we overwrite the pro we overwrite

368
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
the visit

369
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,839
and

370
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,200
and then and then maybe that's okay um

371
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,279
and what seems to be the problem

372
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,079
well

373
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,800
the problem is that infinite scrollers

374
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,760
also unload stuff all right so let's

375
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
look at unloading

376
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,720
um

377
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,959
in order to save resources

378
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,160
uh infinite scrollers basically

379
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,240
unload the stuff that sits at the top

380
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
right so you see this on things like

381
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,760
facebook instagram twitter

382
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,639
and

383
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,560
you can even see it if you manually save

384
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,120
the page if you manually save a page

385
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,160
and you've been scrolled down a lot then

386
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,040
that contents is the content that's at

387
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,199
the top is not there anymore

388
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,320
okay so i'm going to show you what

389
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,279
happens when you scroll down on twitter

390
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,040
i'm going to take this page and i'm

391
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,240
going to pick something that is pretty

392
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
unique so golden chips

393
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,240
however do you search here for golden

394
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
chips you'll see

395
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,560
and it pops up right there it is golden

396
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
trips one of one

397
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,639
easy now i'm gonna scroll down

398
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
and i'm scrolling

399
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,120
i'm scrolling

400
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,000
i'm scrolling

401
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,959
okay and let's say this is far enough

402
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,040
let's say i'm scrolling to this point

403
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,079
right

404
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,000
now i'm going to search for golden chips

405
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,920
again so i do ctrl f

406
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
i'll search for golden chips and what do

407
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
you see zero zero

408
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,279
this means

409
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,160
that part of the page is no longer in

410
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,959
the browser's memory it's been unloaded

411
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,880
at the top right

412
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,279
if i save this page let's say

413
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,199
save as

414
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,360
and we say

415
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,040
um single file i'm twitter save it

416
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,120
that's the mhtml file that's what we

417
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
save as well right

418
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,320
so if i look at this page

419
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,880
and i put it in here

420
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
then you'll see there's a lot of blank

421
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,079
space here

422
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,800
lots of blank space

423
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,880
in fact i can scroll there i'm scrolling

424
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,639
down on the right

425
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,959
oh there we go and there is the page

426
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,199
there's a the window of the page that

427
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,880
you're seeing right

428
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
that's how much your browser is

429
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
basically keeping in memory this part

430
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,360
here is also blank right the rest of it

431
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
is being unloaded and that's to save

432
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,600
resources

433
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,240
so you know you won't even see it here

434
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
so if you're going to save this just

435
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,759
by yourself

436
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,199
you've missed all of this stuff at the

437
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,800
top

438
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,839
so

439
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,399
how do we handle this right to basically

440
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,000
have to save

441
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,759
multiple snapshots of

442
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,040
this page as the user scrolls down so

443
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
imagine like

444
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,040
in the past you've had these old sites

445
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,440
that had like page one page two page

446
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,600
three and a little you know

447
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,279
arrow on the side and you go to the next

448
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,279
page and you go to the next page when

449
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,959
you reach the bottom you know you go to

450
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,160
the next page

451
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
and you can kind of almost see

452
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
that infinite scrollers are can be

453
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,880
treated like that so you're on page one

454
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
you scroll down then you're on page two

455
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
scroll down you're on page three so you

456
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,480
have multiple visits

457
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,120
multiple snapshots for every

458
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,320
um

459
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,880
certain amount that you browse

460
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,560
down right

461
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,920
and there might be a little bit of

462
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,839
overlap between these pages so you know

463
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,600
you might have at the bottom of this

464
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,680
page and the top of the next page is

465
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
kind of the same but that's okay because

466
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,759
you're not then you're actually not

467
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,959
missing the information you're not

468
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,199
throwing information away you have a

469
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,120
little bit of overlap but you don't

470
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
but you're not

471
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,559
discarding in the information right and

472
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
that's what we worried about is that you

473
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,039
lose information

474
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
so this this is from the interface and

475
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,119
you'll see here we have as you scroll

476
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,359
down you have multiple

477
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,559
visits

478
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,520
for a timeline on twitter that you've

479
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,240
been scrolling down for quite a bit

480
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,119
right

481
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,199
so now

482
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,079
for now just to recap right

483
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,440
we we know that if we are unloading

484
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
if we if there's unloading happening we

485
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,360
want to save

486
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,039
multiple snapshots right

487
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,799
because we can't save one because then

488
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,000
we're going to miss information at the

489
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,919
top right so we want to save multiple

490
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,799
snapshots if there's unloading happening

491
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,880
but if there's no unloading happening we

492
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
don't want to

493
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,799
override then we want to override the

494
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,240
snapshot we don't want to then save

495
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,400
multiple snapshots right because imagine

496
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
you have something

497
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,960
like

498
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
the facebook friend page now facebook

499
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,280
friend page actually they don't do any

500
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,679
unloading at the at the top they just

501
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,280
make the page grow bigger and bigger and

502
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
bigger and if you have something like

503
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,080
that

504
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,679
and you just see that it's infinite

505
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
scroller then you'll have multiple

506
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
versions of that friend page and that's

507
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
not what you want you only want one one

508
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,559
page for that so we got to find a way

509
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,280
to know that there's unloading happening

510
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,640
at the top

511
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,039
now how are we going to do that

512
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,960
the way that we do that is we say well

513
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,799
we got the text right

514
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,679
so we've got the text of this page

515
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,120
then when you scroll down a little bit

516
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,760
further we have the text of this page

517
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
now if all of the text that's on this

518
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
page is also on this page

519
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,480
well then there's no text missing right

520
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,280
but if the top was unloaded like this

521
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,200
part of my hand was this part was

522
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,600
unloaded right then this stuff is not on

523
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,039
this stuff then there's a difference

524
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,039
between this this is like this

525
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,600
and this is like this right and there's

526
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,919
things missing this part here is missing

527
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,799
there

528
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,679
and then we know that hey there's been

529
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,080
unloading happening because the content

530
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,640
didn't get bigger the content got

531
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,280
different and content is not different

532
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,640
right it's not we can't find it anymore

533
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
and so we have these things that we

534
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
basically do this text compare and

535
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,000
decide if

536
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,919
there was unloading happening if there's

537
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,880
more than

538
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,679
60 of the old snapshot missing than this

539
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,480
we say hey you've been unloading it you

540
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,280
got to make a new visit right

541
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,880
okay but

542
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,039
doing this is kind of

543
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,880
expensive to do it's an expensive

544
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
operation to do

545
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,480
and so

546
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,960
a lot of sites change the content really

547
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,039
rapidly it's unbelievable what you find

548
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,440
on the internet especially news sites

549
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
so you end up with a lot of duplicated

550
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
visits so we need another condition to

551
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,280
determine when to do this test

552
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,000
and when to do this this text compare

553
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,039
right

554
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,480
um and there is this thing that that

555
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,400
allows us to

556
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,720
to to get a clue that it's going to

557
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,880
happen soon and that is when the page

558
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,799
size changes so on a lot of these

559
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,480
infinite scrollers when you scroll down

560
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,600
you'll see

561
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,760
that the scroll bar you know it's big

562
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,120
and it starts getting smaller and

563
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,880
smaller and that's because

564
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
the page size is changing they update

565
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,720
the page size so for us that's a clue to

566
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,200
say hey but there's been

567
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,919
possibly unloading happening so quickly

568
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,679
compare the text and see if there's a

569
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,320
difference um and if you know some of

570
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,000
the text is missing and if some of the

571
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,480
text missing we know that it's unloading

572
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,360
we know hey we gotta we gotta save a new

573
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
visit we've got to make a new visit

574
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,960
right

575
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,520
um so you'll see that in the in the tool

576
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
there's actually this thing called the

577
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,360
minimum scroll difference and that's in

578
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,840
pixels right and

579
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,120
if there's more than 750

580
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,000
pixels change on the page size

581
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,720
that's going to trigger event whereby we

582
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,520
see

583
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,960
if there's unloading and if it's

584
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,360
unloading then we're going to decide if

585
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
we want to then we're going to decide to

586
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,600
make a new visit right given all of the

587
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,280
restraints that we have

588
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,120
the document ready state the dom

589
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,360
mutations all of those things also gets

590
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,159
played gets into play

591
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,760
but in certain cases

592
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,640
you can't detect the unload and and that

593
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
is because there's no text there's no

594
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,720
text to trigger on so let's think about

595
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,480
a site where

596
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,559
that uses infinite scroller where

597
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,720
there's not a lot of text

598
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
and that would be instagram on instagram

599
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
if we scroll down on instagram we just

600
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,640
see pictures this is pictures and

601
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,400
pictures and pictures there's no text

602
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,559
that we can be like hey actually

603
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,640
no there's a change in text and so we

604
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,720
need to find a way

605
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,559
to basically tell the tool well if

606
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,559
you're on this site um

607
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
you know it is unloading content because

608
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,720
instagram is unloading content at the

609
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,159
top right

610
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,840
you have to save multiple visits

611
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,440
regardless of the fact that there's

612
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,799
changes in text because you're not going

613
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,799
to see any changes in the text because

614
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,960
there's no text right

615
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,200
and then we just decided well you could

616
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,799
just put it in the list and say if

617
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,440
you're on instagram you know it means

618
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,080
when you put this into this into this uh

619
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
field that says override auto unloading

620
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,640
detection which you know nobody knows

621
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,480
what that is normal user look at it and

622
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,440
then they go

623
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
i don't know what this is but now you

624
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,720
know what it is

625
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,559
it basically just means

626
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,480
the site is unloading content but

627
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,640
there's no text so make multiple visits

628
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,559
when you see that the page is getting

629
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,200
bigger right

630
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
right so what is the bottom line bottom

631
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,600
line is

632
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
preserving web pages on the internet is

633
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,960
not

634
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
easy to do and it's not easy to do when

635
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,440
you want to have that design criteria if

636
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,280
you want to meet all the factors in that

637
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,679
design criteria right um and it kind of

638
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,320
feels like you're trying to take

639
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,320
um a photo of a dynamic event you know

640
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,919
it's like saying you got 14 frames

641
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,840
of a film camera and you've got to

642
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,679
record a soccer match

643
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,159
um you know show me all the goals and

644
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,679
you know sometimes you take the picture

645
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,440
because they were close to the goal

646
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,360
you think oh they're going to score now

647
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,120
and then it didn't happen and then you

648
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,880
know he took two photos of just the

649
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,400
grass and it's a difficult thing

650
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,880
and so maybe we must think about

651
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,120
capturing video rather than

652
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,880
snapshots

653
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,679
it feels like we're trying to

654
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,400
capture a dynamic event in a static with

655
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,640
a static mode you know javascript

656
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,960
counting down from 100 to one

657
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
what are you going to say

658
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,400
what is the snapshot going to look like

659
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
you know at what number do you want to

660
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
see that web page because remember we

661
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,840
don't save javascript right

662
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,679
and so it becomes this delicate balance

663
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,600
between

664
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,520
duplicating content is you having

665
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
multiple of the same thing because you

666
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
don't know it's the same

667
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,080
or that you're missing content

668
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,919
or that you're having

669
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,279
too much or you're using too much

670
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,520
resources you either using too much cpu

671
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
to constantly compare things and see if

672
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,840
it's different or you interfering with a

673
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,000
browsing experience by putting a button

674
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
down that the user got to click on you

675
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,039
know to

676
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,960
save the page nobody wants to do that

677
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
right

678
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,520
and

679
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,679
and it is kind of like

680
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,440
you know the program is credo is

681
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,919
something that became my friend during

682
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,400
the journey you know building this which

683
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,240
is you know

684
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,320
we do these things not because they're

685
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,640
easy but because we thought they were

686
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,120
going to be easy and no they're not but

687
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,240
once you've done all of that um and once

688
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,799
you've done all the hard work it's like

689
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,000
you know then you're gonna have your

690
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,120
pudding and your pudding is things like

691
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,400
well we can

692
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,640
we can extract images and from those

693
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,799
images we can extract the exif and we

694
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,600
can

695
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
make the user search on you know the

696
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,200
hash

697
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,039
because we can get the hash of the image

698
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,559
and we can make the user search on the

699
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,600
exif

700
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,440
and we can in we can extract objects um

701
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,840
and we can enrich the objects with apis

702
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,320
and and you know we can

703
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,200
show a heads-up display to the to the

704
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
user in the browser and show them where

705
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,159
they've seen

706
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,520
these things and we can make graphs and

707
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,200
those are all the fun things we can do

708
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
once

709
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
we've been able to

710
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
capture web pages efficiently

711
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,919
so

712
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,400
i hope it's been informative to

713
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,799
understand that it's not easy to save

714
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,159
pages

715
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,080
web pages

716
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,440
and i hope you enjoy this journey with

717
