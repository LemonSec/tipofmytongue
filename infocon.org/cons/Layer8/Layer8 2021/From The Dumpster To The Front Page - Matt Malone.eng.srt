00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,719
hi my name is matt malone and i'm the

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,599
director of cyber security for vestrada

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,560
today we're going to be talking about

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
from the dumpster to the front page

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,320
and i'm going to be throughout this kind

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,400
of giving you some examples of companies

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,560
that have done just that went from a

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,240
dumpster all the way to the front page

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,760
and not a good way

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,960
so more importantly i'm going to show

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,439
you how to avoid that fate

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,399
so

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,840
keeping you out of the headlines is a

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
pretty tall order

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,880
but the agenda we're going to kind of

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,280
cover is the main thing is where's your

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,559
data

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,559
what are your assets and are you in

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,520
control of them that's the overall theme

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,280
the other thing is are you testing to

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,960
really know

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,719
about security or are you just testing

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,559
to pass a grade and then finally we're

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,160
going to be talking about selling a

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,680
security culture

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
the one thing i can say and this is the

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,440
most important part

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
security people should be an ambassador

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,440
to the rest of the organization

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,959
from everything from physical all the

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,960
way to technical it may not be their job

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,920
but we'll kind of get into that

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,960
so

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
obviously i'm coming to you virtually

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
right so

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,080
this is the new normal

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
this is the the if somebody would have

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
went to a i.t administrator or a

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
security person and said

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,680
hey um you know

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
two years ago

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,040
you're going to have your teenage kids

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,479
running around your office you're going

45
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,560
to or if you were to even say we're

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,159
going to bring in and let whoever we

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,240
want into this office

48
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
we're going to let them run gaming

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
networks and maybe download software in

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,600
the next

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,200
room next door

52
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
i.t and security would have freaked out

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,399
so we're at today there is no such thing

54
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,720
as a clean desk policy because

55
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
everything's out there

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,360
so

57
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
in in kind of days of old you used to

58
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,799
have

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,640
used to have castles and the castles

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,719
were the protected environment

61
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,479
and the villages were generally outside

62
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,920
of the castles

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,079
so when an attack would happen everybody

64
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
would run into the castle they would

65
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
close the drawbridge and they would wait

66
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
it out

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,680
it's not the way it is today our village

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,560
is spread out all over the place

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
so

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
there's a couple key questions that you

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,200
have to ask yourself are

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,040
what what kind of security controls do

73
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,360
you have in place at those facilities at

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,120
your homes do you have a shredder in

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,160
your home

76
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
do your employees have shredders at

77
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,840
their home

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
so let's talk a little bit about what

79
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
are your assets

80
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
so

81
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,640
assets can be anything a lot of people

82
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,319
think that assets are

83
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,959
the data in the server or the financial

84
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,640
data or

85
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
you know uh

86
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
the gold in

87
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,519
the gold room whatever it is

88
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,640
that your company considers valuable

89
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,959
we tend to put an asset and claim an

90
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,840
asset as a very high value target

91
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,000
so for instance social security numbers

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
credit card numbers

93
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,760
but there are other things that you need

94
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,480
to be protecting too things like names

95
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
and phone numbers and emails of

96
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,959
employees

97
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,640
those simple things can kind of lead

98
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
into a bigger thing

99
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,400
so for instance

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,840
i'll give you guys an example so i had a

101
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,760
customer i feel bad for this one but had

102
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,200
a customer asked us to do a social

103
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
engineering test so

104
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,560
we went out

105
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
did a zero knowledge let's see what we

106
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
can go find and in their dumpster they

107
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,000
had a phone list they also had some

108
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,519
technical documentation saying that they

109
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,519
had a terminal server

110
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
so i grabbed the phone list looked at

111
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
all the i.t administrators because it

112
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,319
had their job titles

113
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,080
titles their roles where they lived what

114
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,280
their phone number was what their

115
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
address was the whole nine

116
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
so i call him up and i said hey uh john

117
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
this is this is mike i'm over at uh

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,799
microsoft and we're helping steven here

119
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,360
with doing a terminal server upgrade now

120
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
are you logged in right now he says yes

121
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
i say well i'll tell you what i need you

122
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,799
to log out for a minute we're going to

123
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,239
move your account to the new terminal

124
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,159
server which ip address do you normally

125
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,599
connect to

126
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,920
oh he gives me the ip address

127
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
then i go in and i say okay well uh

128
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,760
you want me to set your password back to

129
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
your old one because yeah so i write

130
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
down his old password

131
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,639
i said okay i'm going to log into your

132
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,839
account make sure everything's good to

133
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,720
go

134
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,798
i log in i couldn't get in

135
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,320
so i call the guy back he goes oh you

136
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
got to change the port number the port

137
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
number is this

138
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,639
right that little piece of information

139
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,720
from a phone number

140
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,479
and a name

141
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,560
led into a breach of their system with

142
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,840
full administrator access

143
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
so that's the kind of things that you

144
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,919
don't think about as assets right

145
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,759
the other thing is uh you know we'll

146
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,120
secure a

147
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,440
server room with a badge access or even

148
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,280
a fingerprint scanner

149
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,880
we'll secure our offices with keys

150
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,639
the janitor has the keys to the whole

151
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
building

152
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,919
have we vetted them do we know who they

153
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,639
are

154
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,040
are we doing third party risk management

155
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
again these are the small things that

156
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
kind of add up into the big things

157
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,199
we'll talk about these a little bit more

158
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,000
but

159
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
assets are really what you're trying to

160
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
protect

161
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,600
so i've got a chart here with basically

162
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
all the assets on it right and this is

163
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,960
just a

164
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,120
high level overview but to kind of get

165
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
you thinking in the mindset of what are

166
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
assets and where could they possibly be

167
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
so we've got a mobile or home office

168
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,919
we've got a corporate office

169
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,360
and we've got the business partner

170
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,639
office

171
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
now our data is sitting at all three of

172
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
these places

173
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
at your home

174
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,520
you you do you have do the people who

175
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,039
are working remotely or do the people

176
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,120
who are working at their home do they

177
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
have a shredder at their facility or at

178
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
their house

179
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
are they just taking the the data that

180
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,600
they may be creating and throwing it out

181
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
in the trash with with just everything

182
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,280
else right

183
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,440
the other the other kind of aspect of

184
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
this and when we talk about the

185
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,479
corporate office right

186
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,240
where the data is is not just the

187
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
servers it's not just

188
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,479
you know the laptops and the desktops

189
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,560
but if you're an i.t administrator i

190
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,199
want you to think about that closet

191
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,280
that nobody goes into

192
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
that has all your old equipment and it's

193
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
five years old who cares it's

194
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
it's a low level system

195
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
small amount of ram nobody would ever

196
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,880
want that thing right

197
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,720
and and who cares about the data it's 10

198
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,840
years old

199
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,000
but let me ask you this

200
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,880
have you or anybody else

201
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
change their social security number in

202
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,400
the past 10 years

203
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
no

204
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,919
if that's the case then that data is

205
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,520
still relevant

206
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
and i guarantee you

207
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
we're all somewhat guilty of this

208
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,960
if you were to go pull a password from

209
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
one of those systems

210
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,199
and try tried in a dictionary attack

211
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
their password may have been ajax one

212
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,479
now it's ajax 12 right

213
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,720
so that kind of information can kind of

214
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,199
help people out

215
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,680
i'll tell you another story here to talk

216
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
about kind of this equipment that's out

217
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,560
there

218
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
and two kind of interesting stories

219
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
one is you'll see on their old furniture

220
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
and that's a weird one and a lot of

221
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
people ask me what are you talking about

222
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,360
old furniture

223
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
and a lot of people right now a lot of

224
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,160
companies are getting rid of their

225
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,599
offices and they're they're throwing

226
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,039
away their cubicles

227
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,639
there was one time where a company had

228
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,759
gotten rid of their cubicles and i i was

229
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,120
actually buying some cubicles for my

230
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,360
company i open it up and there's a

231
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,440
username and password to an office depot

232
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
account and i thought

233
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
no there's no way

234
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,840
sure enough it logged right in and it

235
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,400
gave access i called the people up and i

236
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,520
said hey just let you know you should

237
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,599
probably change your password this isn't

238
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
probably good and by the way don't keep

239
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,800
your passwords in the drawer

240
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
and

241
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
we all know somebody at the company that

242
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,960
when they go to log in they can't

243
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,639
remember their password they pull out

244
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,280
the drawer and they type in the password

245
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,039
and i'll i'm gonna get in trouble for

246
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,720
this one hopefully my wife doesn't watch

247
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
this hopefully my wife doesn't see it

248
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,599
but i'll tell you kind of a story one

249
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,759
night we're we're she she's working on

250
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,520
her laptop and her computer is very

251
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
secure with the company that she works

252
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,840
with they have a bios password they have

253
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,599
you know the

254
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,280
you know username password and then a

255
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
couple different accesses to get into

256
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,919
the system

257
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,160
it was late she had a glass of wine and

258
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
she goes i can't remember my password

259
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,680
can you hand me my laptop bag and she

260
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,160
pulls out the password list for her

261
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,639
laptop that's in i

262
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,599
as a security guard guy i cringed as a

263
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,159
husband i i felt like a failure

264
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
but um it's one of those things that it

265
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
can kind of happen you know you you just

266
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
don't connect the dots that if somebody

267
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
steals the laptop bag and they've got

268
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,480
the passwords to the bios

269
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,600
it doesn't matter what kind of disk

270
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
encryption you have they've already got

271
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,200
the access to it so you may be asking

272
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
yourself

273
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,760
who would dumpster dive me right who

274
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
i'm nobody like why would you dumpster

275
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,640
dive me

276
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,800
and and who's doing this dumpster diving

277
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
right so i'm going to give you some

278
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
really strange examples if you see here

279
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
there's there's three people

280
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,519
larry ellison uh bill gates and also the

281
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
the ceo of procter gamble

282
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,600
all three of those people

283
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,279
have actually admitted publicly that

284
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,800
their companies

285
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,320
went out and dumpster dive to do

286
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,640
competitive analysis

287
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
so oracle actually well larry ellison

288
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
tells a story where he actually uh

289
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,560
created oracle from the trash of ibm he

290
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,720
was taking source code from their trash

291
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,279
reading it looking at it rewriting it

292
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,320
right

293
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,080
so if this kind of stuff happens if you

294
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,640
go to uh kraft got in trouble for this

295
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
british airways got in trouble for this

296
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
there's organizations like pinkerton pi

297
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,080
now um any kind of research company that

298
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
will tell you that

299
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,519
they're really there to help you uh gain

300
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,160
a competitive edge

301
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,200
so

302
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
if you think about it

303
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
these guys are

304
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,279
u.s based companies

305
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,839
they're titans of industry

306
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,600
and they're dumpster diving

307
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
or their company is i don't think bill

308
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,320
gates has jumped in the dumpster

309
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,800
but these people have have went out and

310
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,079
hired companies that are doing this

311
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,120
dumpster driving so they're doing

312
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,040
competitive analysis and they're getting

313
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
information from their their other

314
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
people's dumpsters so if they're doing

315
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,839
it

316
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,320
and they're a legal us-based company

317
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,680
what do you think

318
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,279
china russia

319
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,720
or unscrupulous people are going to be

320
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,959
doing

321
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,640
so

322
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
that it's it's a real thing and it

323
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
happens right let's talk about

324
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,200
ransomware right and and

325
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,440
in ransomware and in these attacks that

326
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
are happening

327
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,200
um ransomware a lot of time comes in

328
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
through an email

329
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
and it's a phishing attempt that they

330
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
get a hook in you and then they start

331
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
reeling it in they start applying more

332
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,959
and more and more once they get access

333
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,720
and gain access even further and further

334
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,000
and further

335
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
the difference today in the security

336
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
realm versus many years ago

337
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
was before they would get in do what

338
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
they could and get you know try to get

339
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
out before they got caught

340
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,360
now they're staying in the systems

341
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,680
forever as long as they can

342
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
slowly reeling it in

343
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,959
these these companies that you see on

344
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
the screen here are basically

345
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,200
cpi university of utah

346
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,279
colonial pipeline that's a big one right

347
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,079
five million dollar payout

348
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,560
cpi half a million dollar payout

349
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
university of utah 457 000 payout

350
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,600
ukd is a a really sad one that was a

351
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,160
company it was a hospital in germany

352
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,480
that had a

353
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
patient coming in

354
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
and the patient was needed urgent

355
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,120
medical care

356
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,200
and they could not administer the drugs

357
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
they basically were in a lockdown

358
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
because of a ransomware attack they had

359
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
to send her off to another hospital and

360
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
she died in route

361
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
a human life was caused from that

362
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,399
colonial pipeline

363
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,760
you know

364
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
they shut down the gas

365
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,079
from from here all the way up uh from

366
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,560
texas all the way up uh the east coast

367
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
so that's a pretty big one solar winds

368
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
we don't even know

369
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,680
what solar winds is going to come out to

370
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,800
be

371
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,639
what the damages and the ramifications

372
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,760
are

373
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,160
now the way that the reason i bring this

374
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,079
stuff up is you may be saying well

375
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,600
ransomware how you get it from a

376
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,360
dumpster or social engineering or a

377
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,800
business email compromise how do you get

378
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
that out of a dumpster

379
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,920
well the chances are

380
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,000
if you do information gathering and when

381
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
i say dumpster i mean i want you to kind

382
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
of get a broader subject i want you to

383
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,959
think about

384
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,560
where your data is so for instance

385
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
it may be out there on an old website

386
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,720
you may have content that's if you've

387
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
ever done google hacking where you can

388
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,600
type in file type colon xls

389
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
space password

390
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,279
it's shocking the amount of excel

391
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,959
documents you will find that have been

392
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,000
google

393
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
uh have have been picked up by google

394
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
and are now in in google's

395
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,360
searchable database and you can find

396
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,720
those passwords

397
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
so that kind of stuff is the footprints

398
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,600
and the crumbs that we're talking about

399
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
that build

400
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
to better attacks

401
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,399
right

402
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,800
so 95 percent of the security breaches

403
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,360
are done by human error

404
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,440
95 percent

405
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,880
well and i can say this

406
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,279
never in the history that i know of has

407
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,200
one computer looked at another computer

408
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,120
and said you know what i'm gonna attack

409
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,839
you

410
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,200
don't know why i'm just gonna attack you

411
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,399
i don't like you

412
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,160
computers don't do that humans are

413
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,680
usually behind the whole system right

414
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,560
so

415
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,079
45 of those breaches involved hacking 17

416
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,000
involved malware and 22 involved fishing

417
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,279
now

418
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,720
in the reality

419
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,839
fishing

420
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,920
leads to malware leads to hacking right

421
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,800
so

422
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,399
you can basically go from the dumpster

423
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,560
all the way up to a full-blown hack

424
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
and it's just one piece of the the

425
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,880
puzzle right

426
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,760
so

427
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,320
why is it though that we

428
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,800
we have this belief

429
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,360
that it's not going to happen to us

430
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
it's not you know everybody else is

431
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,480
getting breached they're getting hacked

432
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,079
but you know we're fine we're not going

433
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,199
to get hacked

434
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,160
nobody thinks they're going to get

435
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,639
hacked until they get hacked

436
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,399
so i read a times article and i put it

437
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,240
up here on the screen

438
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,839
i really like

439
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,079
this article it talks about optimistic

440
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,279
bias

441
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,680
and in the cyber security realm

442
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,959
optimistic bias is a lot of the problem

443
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
we think it's not going to happen to us

444
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,320
and oh i'm just going to do it this one

445
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,760
time

446
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,199
perfect example

447
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,839
texting while driving we all know that

448
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,680
texting while driving is dangerous it's

449
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
bad you can kill you get killed in an

450
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
instant

451
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,639
we still kind of do it right

452
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,399
we try not to we think about it but you

453
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,839
know it's not it's okay it's just a

454
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,920
quick text i'm fine i'm i'm a good

455
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,600
driver

456
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
now i put up here uh every try to eat a

457
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
tiger now this is the root of why we

458
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,959
have optimistic bias and optimistic bias

459
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,720
worked for us

460
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,160
thousands and thousands of years ago

461
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,480
when you were in a a village and you had

462
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,920
to go

463
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,639
chase a saber-toothed tiger down with a

464
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,560
little spear and kill him and that was

465
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,399
your breakfast

466
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,839
the other five guys who went after him

467
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,240
didn't turn out so well

468
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,040
but

469
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,839
i'm gonna be okay right optimistic bias

470
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,199
helps you get out of bed in the morning

471
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,480
and say you know i'm gonna face this

472
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
thing even though it's a pretty big

473
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
challenge

474
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
so understanding that and understanding

475
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,600
the the reasoning behind that helps to

476
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
understand the psychology of this

477
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
and helps to give you a view of

478
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
perception versus reality right our

479
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
perception may be one thing but the

480
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,079
reality is truly another

481
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,519
so bruce schneier if you guys don't know

482
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,199
who that is definitely follow him he's a

483
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,360
a great commentator on cyber security

484
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,759
one of his all-time my all-time favorite

485
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
quotes of his is if you think technology

486
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
can solve your problem

487
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
your security problem then you don't

488
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,639
understand the problem and you

489
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,759
definitely don't understand the

490
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,880
technology right

491
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,959
if you were to go out and and talk to

492
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,199
the the people in in your organization

493
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,279
and say who's in charge of security

494
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,199
there's one of two people

495
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,320
they're going to point to the guy at the

496
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,079
front desk with a gun

497
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,519
or they're going to

498
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,360
point to somebody with a firewall right

499
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,800
those are the people who are in charge

500
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,359
of security

501
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,639
but that isn't necessarily right you

502
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,519
know

503
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,880
everybody's in charge of security

504
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,240
i'll give a couple of examples of of

505
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
having kind of this false belief

506
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
right the false belief that technology

507
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,240
is going to solve our problems and we're

508
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,160
going to be okay and nobody can can

509
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,600
interact

510
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,720
the guy who started lifelock now he

511
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,959
posted his social security number on the

512
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,079
side of a bus and drove it around

513
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,800
and he got hacked 13 times

514
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,839
he got identity theft 13 times

515
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,039
um

516
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,599
the other thing is that uh you you think

517
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
about to me the scariest person

518
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,520
in all of

519
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,199
when you're in the cyber security realm

520
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,119
is the guy who says

521
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,039
oh we're good i've got it we're totally

522
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,199
secure we don't we're good we don't need

523
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,720
to test we're fine

524
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
solar winds the reason they got hacked

525
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,640
into was password123

526
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
i think it was actually solarwinds123

527
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,559
but it was basically a very simple

528
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,080
password that should have only been on a

529
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,679
test server but test servers

530
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,400
if you put code on a test server and

531
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,559
that code gets moved over to staging and

532
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,320
that staging gets moved over to

533
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
production

534
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,640
if you attack the weakest point you can

535
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,280
take it all the way down the line

536
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,320
so it's important to kind of understand

537
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
you know not having having those false

538
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,678
beliefs can be pretty dangerous

539
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,039
so

540
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,080
we have all these controls

541
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
yet the controls are still failing

542
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,200
right

543
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,440
now after world war ii or i'm sorry

544
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,360
after world war one

545
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
france decided

546
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,880
no more

547
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
we are not going to do this trench

548
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
warfare anymore and if we're going to do

549
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,360
it we're going to do it right we're

550
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
going to do it on our terms

551
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,440
so they built the maginot line and if

552
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,640
you guys don't know what the maginot

553
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
line is go look it up it is amazing

554
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,799
the

555
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,440
it has pill boxes it has

556
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,280
trains that run underground from one

557
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,039
section of the imaginator to the other

558
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,960
so they can move and transport troops

559
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,039
and tanks everything pretty quickly they

560
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
have underground bunkers for aircraft

561
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
they have

562
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,360
an amazing feat of engineering

563
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,840
technology and they had it in place

564
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,640
ready for world war ii

565
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
and germany went around to belgium and

566
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,760
they took them

567
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,880
so

568
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
it was a great idea a great concept but

569
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,080
it wasn't covering the whole thing it

570
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,760
just kind of covered a piece of it it

571
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
covered germany because that was their

572
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,520
aggressor

573
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,440
they had some stuff on belgium but

574
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
really nothing and i can say that the

575
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,520
maginot line did work

576
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,559
when we tried to uh go from france to

577
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,679
germany we came up against a very hard

578
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,160
conflict when we got to the maginot line

579
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
unfortunately the guns were pointed at

580
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,559
us and not at germany

581
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,400
so

582
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
there there's a if you guys have seen

583
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,039
the movie uh world war z

584
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,440
and the tenth man so the tenth man

585
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
strategy says if nine people agree on a

586
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,400
particular course of action the tenth

587
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
person must in context of strategy

588
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
take a contrary approach so that all

589
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
alternatives are considered

590
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
i love that approach i love that idea

591
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,880
and that concept because

592
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
if we all agree with each other

593
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,480
and we all say oh yeah this is the best

594
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
plan of action and there's no real like

595
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,320
devil's advocate in the room

596
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,679
that can lead to some pretty big

597
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,600
problems

598
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,240
so having that devil's advocate can be a

599
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,880
really good thing and also we'll talk

600
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,120
about inclusion and some other stuff

601
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,520
as well

602
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,240
looking at the bigger picture i love

603
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,840
this picture it's one of my favorites

604
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,679
you can see there in the middle there's

605
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
a little security control arm and you

606
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,720
can see from the building that there's a

607
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
light snow that has fallen and obviously

608
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,480
people have driven around the tire track

609
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,679
with

610
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,880
driven around it you get the tire tracks

611
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,559
so what's important to note about this

612
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,320
picture was it's actually taken from

613
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,559
nist the national institute of standards

614
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,000
and technology

615
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
so even they can get it wrong right but

616
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,320
on paper this thing looks pretty good it

617
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,400
looks great okay there's a driveway

618
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,760
there's a parking lot here we don't want

619
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,200
people to park here we'll put a security

620
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
gate

621
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
and then when you actually kind of look

622
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,039
at it in reality you're like oh all

623
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,960
right that was a pretty bad failure but

624
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,720
it's okay failures are okay as long as

625
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,000
you fix them

626
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,640
some of the stuff i've talked about like

627
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,840
do your employees have shredders

628
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,440
another thing we talked about is are

629
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
they disposing of stuff at their house

630
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,919
correctly

631
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,679
another thing we talked about was old

632
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,480
servers in the server like

633
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,760
what janitor's keys that's not my job

634
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,679
i'm not a custodian

635
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,559
how is that my job

636
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,440
again it's from here

637
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,480
to here

638
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,320
it may not be your job but at the end of

639
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,919
the day when the system gets breached

640
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,480
and you get hacked into

641
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,760
it's your job

642
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,080
right so you may be fired because of

643
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,200
something that a user clicked on

644
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,440
because the

645
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,000
the person came in and they took

646
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,840
a piece of trash they figured out who

647
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
they could target how to communicate to

648
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
them in an effective manner

649
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,760
the best way to social engineer them

650
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,679
they sent out an email that didn't work

651
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,360
they sent out another one and this one

652
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,679
kind of triggered and now they've got

653
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,200
malware on their system and next thing

654
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,640
you know the whole system's locked up on

655
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
ransomware

656
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,480
you say that wasn't your job

657
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,360
but you may say it on your way out

658
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,400
right

659
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,640
so

660
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,400
it's it's really important to kind of

661
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
think about this from the beginning

662
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,360
steps

663
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,679
and not the end of the day it's easier

664
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,679
to catch something when it's small and

665
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,520
to eliminate those things and

666
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,000
what we're talking about

667
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
is not super

668
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,080
super costly

669
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,799
right so your data has spread out

670
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,919
it's

671
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,679
your electronic footprint for years

672
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,120
websites

673
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,880
maybe they've got your email list maybe

674
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
they've got your

675
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
systems that you use on maybe your they

676
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
know that you're a microsoft shop and

677
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
you maybe have uh different types of

678
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,799
systems that they can access maybe they

679
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,480
know that you're using teams so now that

680
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,080
they can call and communicate to your

681
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,600
users that hey you know this is

682
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
microsoft i'm calling from teams we

683
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,280
noticed that you had a login failure

684
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,039
which you need to reset your password

685
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,880
you know next thing you know

686
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,720
so again i'm trying to get people to

687
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
think about

688
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,520
that that larger picture right

689
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
and and there's communication struggles

690
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
right now if somebody calls me and says

691
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,080
hey look

692
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,880
um you know i'm from the i.t department

693
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,799
there are people that we have hired that

694
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,640
i've never met at my company i've never

695
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,679
seen them

696
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,280
right i don't know who they are i i

697
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,400
haven't had a conversation with him

698
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,320
because it's been during coven

699
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,080
and we just haven't got to meet face to

700
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,600
face we didn't have a company christmas

701
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
party last year right so and that's our

702
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,760
time to kind of meet and greet

703
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,039
so

704
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,720
we have all of these struggles we have

705
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,640
third party contractors who are holding

706
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,799
our data and we have access to that data

707
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,640
they have access to full data that can

708
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
really us

709
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,679
are we asking them the right questions

710
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,240
of how they're securing their stuff

711
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,279
we've all got trust issues

712
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,960
everyone is a part of security and

713
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,799
this is where i'm i'm going to really

714
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,000
hone in and really really talk about it

715
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
so in order for us to all be part of

716
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,000
security

717
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
we really need to understand that you

718
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
need an army so everything that i've

719
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
told you to go kind of look at and think

720
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,840
about you're like man you're talking

721
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,279
about the internet you're talking about

722
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,320
all this stuff and like

723
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,000
this is an immense amount of work you're

724
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,679
absolutely right

725
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,360
if you were to go do it you would never

726
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
have the time to do it you'd never have

727
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,440
the energy the effort you just you would

728
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,039
die before you got to the finish line

729
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,000
so

730
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
inclusion and not

731
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,559
you want inclusion and not exclusive

732
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,159
right you want to be you want to bring

733
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,360
people in there and you want to be the

734
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,200
ambassador to them

735
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,799
so

736
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,200
if you ask someone hey i just wanted to

737
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,480
get your advice

738
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,840
in your department what do you

739
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,039
think just brainstorming what do you

740
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,799
guys think are some security risks that

741
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,720
you guys can think of and let me reward

742
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,880
you for those if you find a security

743
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,720
risk let me reward you

744
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,880
so

745
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,080
i'll tell you guys

746
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,720
it's it's important to have to be the

747
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,880
the let's figure out a solution

748
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
let's figure out more problems let's see

749
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,760
if we can kind of find some more stuff

750
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
than it is to be the no you can't do

751
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,559
that

752
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,960
no no no if you're a security guy who

753
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,760
says no no no and and you're the the cog

754
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
in the will to everything nobody wants

755
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,960
to go to that guy

756
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
if you're the guy who helps them figure

757
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,039
out a solution and helps them figure out

758
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,880
a solution not figures it out and tells

759
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,320
them what they're going to be doing not

760
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,159
forcefully

761
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,760
pressing down on them say here's the way

762
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,640
it is

763
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
but but includes them in the

764
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,000
conversation brings them to the table

765
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,520
let's let them see your side of the

766
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,360
conversation so that they can help you

767
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,960
better strategize

768
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,440
right include these people bring them in

769
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,279
that right there is going to be

770
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,279
more valuable than anything you can ever

771
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,679
imagine

772
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
so

773
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,200
how do we fix this stuff right

774
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,520
we've been talking a lot a lot of stuff

775
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,360
talking about a lot of tall orders um

776
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,039
we're talking about a lot of loose

777
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,600
information out there

778
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,039
so one thing is knowing your digital

779
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,880
footprint and again using everybody to

780
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,039
kind of do that

781
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,880
doing it yourself again it's going to be

782
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,559
really hard but doing a collective

783
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,320
conversation with people

784
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,840
um making it fun

785
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,760
so

786
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,840
again my wife the company she works for

787
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,760
is very secure and i i definitely

788
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,279
appreciate that and

789
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,640
she's uh

790
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
she's now become like a rock star of the

791
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,440
security awareness stuff because she

792
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,039
she usually gets pretty good scores on

793
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,480
him because she kind of has a husband

794
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,120
who's in cyber security

795
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,799
but she

796
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,320
she loves when she does the social

797
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,840
engineering and they send an email and

798
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,799
they say hey

799
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,240
you know and she clicks on it and

800
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
notifies them that hey this is a problem

801
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
and it goes to ching you did a great job

802
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
and she actually loves that stuff she

803
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,880
likes that reward system so knowing your

804
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,720
digital footprint helping having the

805
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,440
users to help you get there right

806
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
uh where where do you think some of our

807
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,799
data is what do you think data that is

808
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,559
critical could be let's do a thought

809
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,159
experiment about that let's do a

810
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,679
roundtable around that bringing in

811
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,480
management talking about that

812
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
so and in order to do that you got to

813
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,000
think outside the box you got to think

814
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,080
on down the line so we talked about over

815
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,720
here where a piece of trash turns into a

816
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,840
social engineering or fishing experiment

817
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
more apt and then comes into a

818
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,880
full-blown malware and ransomware attack

819
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,799
so you got to think about it from that

820
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,799
perspective it's like well what is this

821
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,240
data and does it really need to be out

822
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,640
there can we limit some of these things

823
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,240
and how are some ways that we can do

824
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
that so thinking about the whole way and

825
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,520
again building an army and training them

826
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,760
i there was a

827
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
boss that i had several several several

828
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,960
years ago

829
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,159
and

830
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,440
he would train a bunch of people and

831
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,200
then eventually they would leave you

832
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,360
know and somebody asked him he's like

833
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,720
why do you keep sending these guys to

834
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,799
training when they're gonna leave and he

835
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,679
goes

836
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,200
well would you rather i didn't train

837
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,000
them and they stayed

838
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,919
you know you got to train people you got

839
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,600
to make it security where so

840
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,840
security is unfortunately top of mind it

841
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,440
has to be top of mind you got to kind of

842
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,919
bring it up in fun ways exciting ways

843
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,440
posters

844
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,360
emails you know whatever it is to kind

845
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,520
of slowly kind of push them into it and

846
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,559
again bring them part of it

847
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,399
so and i'll i'll say this before i

848
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,240
before i go off that slide

849
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,080
so

850
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,360
you know a reward program can be a very

851
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,919
incentivizing right it helps to to bring

852
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,760
the person in and say hey if you run

853
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,320
into a better idea a better way to do

854
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,640
this stuff let me know and if you do so

855
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
i'll give you give you a prize 50 bucks

856
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,080
or whatever

857
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,399
so i'll tell a story and this actually

858
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,399
had to do with wideout so

859
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,799
the typist up in dallas texas was trying

860
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,000
to figure out

861
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,600
um a better way because every time

862
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,960
they'd make a mistake they'd have to

863
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,559
kind of start over

864
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,480
so she tried to figure out a way to to

865
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,320
cover it up and she invented a thing

866
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,760
called white out

867
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
white out led to

868
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,480
it was michael nesmeth it was his mom

869
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,159
that did that the michael nesbith when

870
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,720
he got the fortune from his mom

871
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,399
he was obviously one of the monkeys and

872
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,520
then he ended up creating mtv

873
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,799
so a small little reward program

874
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,120
it was that that then created

875
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,200
that aspect

876
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
when we talk about training testing and

877
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,640
making aware

878
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
i want people to kind of think about

879
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,240
fire drills for schools and let's just

880
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,000
take it down to a simple principle right

881
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,240
fires in schools used to be a very bad

882
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,159
thing and it was killing kids they

883
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,600
weren't prepared they didn't know where

884
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,200
to go they didn't you know they didn't

885
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,279
know how many kids were missing

886
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,960
right so then they started really

887
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,120
putting into the schools this program of

888
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,760
teaching them doing fire drills

889
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,919
so you line these kids up and you say

890
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,559
okay fire drill's coming you have a job

891
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,480
your job is to know that johnny's in

892
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,960
front of you and mary's behind you

893
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,880
johnny's in front of you and mary's

894
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,440
behind you and where's johnny

895
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,880
now all of a sudden you go find johnny

896
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,559
now you go out to the to the red flag

897
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,360
pole

898
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,399
right so

899
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,039
that training over and over and over and

900
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,919
over

901
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,200
has made it super safe in america for

902
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,080
for school fires right

903
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,679
now let's take it to a little bit more

904
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,799
of a an adult approach right um when the

905
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,440
navy seals went to go uh find osama bin

906
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,520
laden

907
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,880
they didn't just like drop the

908
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,520
helicopter in and go okay let's go look

909
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,440
over here and see if he's there they

910
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,600
knew there's 15 steps to here there's

911
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,799
going to be a right turn there's going

912
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,320
to be a door we're going to and they

913
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
they trained over and over and over they

914
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,000
built what's called a shoot house out in

915
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,279
california

916
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,120
there was a replica of that building and

917
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,600
they practiced it over and over and over

918
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,240
and over and when they finally went in a

919
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
helicopter

920
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,440
failed on them

921
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,039
but they were still able to complete the

922
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,440
mission because they they were ready

923
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,039
they knew the different scenarios they

924
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,320
knew what was going to happen and they

925
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,000
knew how to address it

926
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,679
so that training going back to simple

927
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,519
going back to testing

928
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,320
training and making aware

929
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,000
that simple stuff that you learned as a

930
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,120
kid

931
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,679
believe it or not will help you today

932
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,480
building those scenarios so how do you

933
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,320
do that

934
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,399
right you should be doing

935
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,000
some security awareness you should be

936
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,640
doing some social engineering

937
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,519
and you should be testing right

938
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,840
so in order to test and i had a customer

939
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,919
who called me a while back and they said

940
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,200
well actually let me rephrase that they

941
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,559
were a potential customer they were

942
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,080
thinking about hiring us

943
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,000
and the guy called me and said look i i

944
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,480
need a test i need a vulnerability test

945
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,000
but i need it to pass

946
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,519
what

947
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,600
you don't need a vulnerability test if

948
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,760
you're just wanting it to pass i mean

949
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
it's like saying i want the degree but i

950
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,519
don't want to go to the courses

951
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,279
you can have the degree but you're still

952
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,640
not going to know anything about it

953
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,440
right

954
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,760
so i i'm not that guy i'm not going to

955
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,399
do a test just so you can pass

956
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,720
you should be doing a test to fail

957
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,559
you want it you want to try and find as

958
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,480
many problems as you can because you can

959
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,519
fix them

960
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,159
and if you happen to pass well good for

961
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,080
you kudos

962
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,760
dig a little deeper too

963
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
right because there's always a failure

964
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,600
in the system somewhere but

965
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
it's it's important to kind of

966
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,000
understand how to do that testing

967
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
right

968
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,360
also is there a human element in it so a

969
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,640
lot of people say well we have this

970
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,360
technology and it runs against the scans

971
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
okay in a previous slide we talked about

972
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,279
how many of those things are human error

973
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,600
95 are human error

974
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,840
and if your testing is 100 technology

975
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,480
driven

976
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,760
you got a problem

977
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
right

978
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,640
so

979
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,320
knowing the risks can literally make all

980
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,760
the difference in the world if you if

981
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,200
you know

982
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,960
if you know if you're if you're going to

983
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
be taking a boat out you might want to

984
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
check the weather

985
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
right before you go

986
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,799
because if you don't know the risk that

987
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,880
you're getting into you might be sailing

988
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,640
right into a hurricane

989
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
that's problematic

990
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,559
and i can guarantee this and i know that

991
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,480
every salesperson says this but a cost

992
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
of an assessment is cheaper it's a

993
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,120
fraction pennies

994
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,440
to the cost of an incident response 100

995
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,679
i had a i had a customer up in up in new

996
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,000
york they called me

997
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,039
they said

998
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,799
hey we need you to

999
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,000
we need some help on an incident

1000
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
response and i said okay i flew up there

1001
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,200
immediately

1002
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,320
and

1003
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,080
they were losing

1004
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,000
thousands of dollars every like half an

1005
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
hour so it was just incredible the

1006
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,519
amount of money that they were losing

1007
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,480
and

1008
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,200
what it was was it was a server

1009
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,039
that they didn't know about

1010
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,440
that was oh well that's an old it's an

1011
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
old server nobody uses it it's just kind

1012
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,880
of we need to get rid of it but we

1013
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,840
haven't yet well that

1014
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,039
server was the jumping point for the

1015
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,559
attacker who then got into the system

1016
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,080
and just killed everything else but they

1017
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,519
didn't even know that on none other

1018
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,279
network diagrams was that was that

1019
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,360
server anywhere on there

1020
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,640
nowhere was it listed on their

1021
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,480
vulnerability scans nowhere was it

1022
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,840
listed their

1023
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,919
on their their network maps or talked

1024
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,159
about in the meeting so

1025
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,040
finding that server would have been way

1026
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,359
more inexpensive now the hard part is

1027
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,918
it's hard to tell

1028
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,440
whether

1029
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,599
you know that is going to lead to if you

1030
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,760
fix the problem then you know nobody

1031
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,839
cares security is a hard life

1032
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,639
if we do our job we're a waste of money

1033
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,199
if we don't do our job we're a failure

1034
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,119
right we're like car insurance nobody

1035
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,918
nobody wants it until they need it

1036
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,159
then they're happy to have it

1037
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,399
so

1038
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,280
to perform a test and and

1039
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,839
i'm kind of going to describe so in

1040
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,280
social engineering when i think about a

1041
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,159
social engineering test i start out with

1042
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,079
defining the assets

1043
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,760
and then figure out ways to better

1044
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,239
protect those assets

1045
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,280
so

1046
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,079
i also the other key element of this is

1047
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,359
i want to i want to talk to

1048
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,839
the the end users

1049
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,240
and i want to build out a test program

1050
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,000
that works for them now i don't want to

1051
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,079
make them look stupid

1052
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,000
that's not at all it because if you do

1053
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,560
that your test is going to fail

1054
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
your test is to make them aware that oh

1055
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,320
man this could happen

1056
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,000
i used to go

1057
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,599
when i do a social engineering test on a

1058
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,280
company to see if i could get in without

1059
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
a badge right

1060
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,760
don't ever go through the front door

1061
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,480
that receptionist will tear you up

1062
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,400
it's hard to get past her but if you

1063
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,240
walk back to the docks in a suit and you

1064
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,079
say hey excuse me i left my badge inside

1065
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,680
could you let me in let's do the

1066
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,359
shipping department nine times out of

1067
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,359
ten go ahead buddy

1068
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,400
i actually had a company out in

1069
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
california that hired me to do a social

1070
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,920
engineering test

1071
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,240
and i got all the way into the facility

1072
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,720
i bet the guy the salesperson that hey

1073
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,960
i'm gonna get in there to the room and

1074
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,680
he was laughing and i didn't know why

1075
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,320
so we bet a hundred dollars i i i go in

1076
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,520
i get all the way through the building

1077
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
and i get up to the it department and i

1078
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,359
love grabbing the uh

1079
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,960
the fire exit map because it kind of

1080
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,720
shows you where everything is and i get

1081
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,079
all the way to the it department and i

1082
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,240
realize the meeting is in the server

1083
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,960
room it's a big glass server room

1084
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,520
so i get up and as i'm walking towards

1085
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,920
it the other guy just badged in and

1086
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,320
opens the door and i said oh hey i left

1087
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,240
my badge over there in my bag

1088
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,839
can i go grab it he's like oh yeah sure

1089
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,560
go ahead i walk in that was the it

1090
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,400
manager who hired me he didn't know that

1091
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,160
i was a social engineer who just came in

1092
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,280
and

1093
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,680
he just led into the server room right

1094
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,560
and when i sit down he goes oh man

1095
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,000
this is going to be an interesting test

1096
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
isn't it i said yeah it is but it's okay

1097
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,920
it's okay so don't make them feel stupid

1098
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,960
make them feel like a part of it

1099
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,880
so we're also going to do a test on a

1100
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,119
wide variety of controls so not just you

1101
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,119
know technology controls but those those

1102
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,400
controls are going to be things like

1103
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
physical

1104
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,640
information control employee response

1105
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,520
right

1106
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,839
uh policy adherence and and anytime you

1107
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,760
do one of these tests i can tell you

1108
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,119
um

1109
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,480
notify

1110
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,960
uh the corporate security notifies the

1111
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,560
people in management so that they know

1112
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,440
what's going on because you'll start if

1113
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,280
if the employees start to call up that's

1114
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,359
great we're glad to know that but we

1115
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,040
don't want it to go to a

1116
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,160
you know swat team situation right

1117
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,079
so we're also going to base on a wide

1118
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,839
base of control so we're going to talk

1119
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,079
to reception contractors

1120
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,400
um you know third party organizations

1121
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
all kinds of stuff

1122
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,359
and we're going to we're going to go

1123
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,280
through that

1124
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,960
and and what i think the benefit is

1125
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,040
is that you're gonna you're gonna find

1126
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,720
that you're gonna get security awareness

1127
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,800
right there's nothing more valuable than

1128
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,480
that person who goes oh man you know

1129
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,040
that guy i i thought he was maybe it was

1130
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,119
him but they ended up stopping attackers

1131
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,079
so

1132
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,839
if you're doing this and they're they're

1133
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,280
now it's a cat and mouse game they're

1134
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,960
looking to catch you right so they know

1135
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,480
that these security awareness tests

1136
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,320
happen

1137
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,839
they may not catch you but they may

1138
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,599
catch somebody who's actually doing it

1139
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,000
and and hopefully they do catch you so i

1140
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,160
oftentimes if somebody like if i walk

1141
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,680
into a building and i'm doing a test

1142
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,640
where i'm trying to get in the server

1143
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,720
room somebody says excuse me who are you

1144
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,560
i go congratulations i give them a

1145
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,800
little prize i give them a note telling

1146
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,079
them exactly what i'm doing and who to

1147
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,839
contact in their

1148
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,119
office to let them know that this is

1149
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,280
just a test and then i ask them hey look

1150
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,720
don't don't spread this around we're

1151
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,079
doing a cyber security test here's

1152
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,839
what's going on

1153
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,119
that awareness will last for months

1154
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,599
those people will always be diligent and

1155
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,280
then when you come to give the results

1156
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,520
to the organization don't limit it to

1157
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,599
just the i.t department

1158
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,760
show other people show other people how

1159
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,680
this happened you don't have to put them

1160
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,520
on on you know front street and blast

1161
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
them out but do put it out there that

1162
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,599
hey look a guy came in and and was able

1163
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,200
to sit in our offices or was able to

1164
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,440
um you know elicit information from our

1165
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,640
receptionist

1166
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,480
this is stuff that happens and it was

1167
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,280
it's better to have it happen as a test

1168
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,480
than it is as a reality

1169
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,359
so

1170
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,640
the other thing is it's going to do is

1171
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,040
it's going to you know assess the risks

1172
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
of well

1173
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,320
how easy was that to get into how hard

1174
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,119
was that to get into

1175
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,440
now you've done all this testing we've

1176
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
now figured out our digital footprint we

1177
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,599
know what's going on

1178
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,680
now we got to sell it to our management

1179
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,160
right because

1180
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,440
if this is what we want to do we want to

1181
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,800
start doing these tests and i can tell

1182
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,760
you this

1183
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,280
social engineering

1184
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
uh phishing

1185
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,520
those sorts of tests are way cheaper

1186
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,359
than most things they're super easy a

1187
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,119
lot of times if you need to slap posters

1188
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,119
around your facility that talks about

1189
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,119
the cyber security risks and loose lip

1190
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,280
sync ships

1191
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,599
doesn't cost you more than a poster

1192
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,079
just try it build out social engineering

1193
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,760
programs to where you now have an army

1194
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,920
of people now the way to sell this is a

1195
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,359
couple different ways

1196
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,280
when you go to talk to your bosses think

1197
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,920
like a mba and not assist p

1198
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,640
don't think like a security guy because

1199
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,800
they're business people

1200
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,640
and when you come to them you do have to

1201
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,720
talk to them about risks but you also

1202
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,240
have to talk to them about advantages

1203
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,000
so if you talk to them about advantages

1204
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,359
and you teach them

1205
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,960
like hey look here are some of the risks

1206
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,640
that we have now here's the cost of it

1207
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,520
if it happens and here's the the

1208
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,359
amount that it would cost to fix it now

1209
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,640
there are some other options that we can

1210
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,880
do which are smaller programs like

1211
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,800
security awareness with posters or we

1212
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,400
can do

1213
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,640
internal social engineering right

1214
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,920
there's a lot of different ways to kind

1215
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,200
of test those things

1216
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,720
and to build that out and to talk to

1217
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
your senior management

1218
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,319
the other thing is through communication

1219
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,400
awareness right

1220
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
again talking to the people in the

1221
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,160
different organizations and giving them

1222
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,920
challenges to kind of think about stuff

1223
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,240
and bring you back with solutions

1224
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,319
let them make it fun let them make it

1225
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,760
part of their job

1226
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,200
because everybody has a role in

1227
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,760
responsibility and security whether it's

1228
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,000
keeping their laptop safe whether it's

1229
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,040
keeping

1230
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,839
their

1231
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,359
data safe whether it's keeping a

1232
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,359
customer's data safe we all have a job

1233
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,280
in security and if you don't if they

1234
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,640
don't know that

1235
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,760
you've got a bigger problem than that

1236
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
so training education and then also

1237
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
giving roles and responsibilities

1238
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,040
but also testing so doing a small test

1239
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,280
can lead to bigger tests later

1240
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,160
right

1241
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,880
if you show the ceo

1242
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,200
i actually had another test that we did

1243
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,800
where we uh

1244
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,880
we went into this basically they

1245
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,560
challenged me to go to the ceo's office

1246
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,079
right and to have a sit-down meeting

1247
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,440
with him

1248
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,599
and and we did that we showed that we

1249
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,280
were able to bypass pretty much all the

1250
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,560
security controls and get into his

1251
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,240
office and have that conversation with

1252
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,680
him when he came in

1253
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,440
um it was very awkward but at the same

1254
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,319
time

1255
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,240
he they knew him well enough that they

1256
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,079
they knew that we could do the test but

1257
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,760
that actually kind of sparked his

1258
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,359
interest to go you know what if this can

1259
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,400
happen to me it's going to happen to

1260
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,000
anybody

1261
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,079
so uh the other thing is vulnerability

1262
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,800
testing pen testing all of those things

1263
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
lead into kind of showing senior

1264
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,560
management like look here are the risks

1265
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,880
and again don't be afraid

1266
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,440
of actually having

1267
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,200
a bad score or to have a failure on

1268
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,240
there

1269
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,160
understand that anytime you have a

1270
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,400
vulnerability test or a pen test or a

1271
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,680
risk assessment that has results

1272
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
those are things you can go fix

1273
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,440
and i can guarantee you if you have a

1274
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,839
perfect score with no problems

1275
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,160
you might want to check that out there's

1276
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,079
no there's no perfect people right

1277
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,000
there's no perfect systems the the most

1278
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,920
secure system is a system that doesn't

1279
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,240
exist

1280
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,760
so with that

1281
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
we'll open up the q a and again my name

1282
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,520
is matt malone and i'm with vestrada

1283
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,319
security as the director
