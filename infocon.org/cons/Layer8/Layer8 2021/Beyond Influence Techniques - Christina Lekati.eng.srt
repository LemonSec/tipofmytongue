1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,600
hello everybody and welcome at another

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
layer 8 conference i'm very happy to be

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,839
here today and to be given the

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,080
opportunity to present a topic that i

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,240
hope will inject some

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,280
new aspects and some new ideas and

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
elements of the people that are working

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,199
within our industry on the human element

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400
of security either in an offensive or in

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,320
a defensive capacity

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,519
this topic relies heavily on psychology

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,920
and what i have learned through studying

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,079
and practicing psychology in my earlier

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,200
years

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,760
and yeah and i hope it will help you

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,399
apply what i have learned in your work

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,800
in social engineering

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
a few words about me my name is

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,719
christina lecate i have a background and

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,440
a degree in psychology i have applied

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
what i've learned in my work as a social

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,000
engineer and currently i am a trainer

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,800
and consultant for cyberesque in behalf

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,600
on the human element of security

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
i am also part of the team that leads

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
the corporate and high value target

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
vulnerability assessments within our

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
company and also a very happy and proud

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,799
member of the awesome curious project

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,280
along with a team of incredible

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
individuals

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,920
let's dive right in who is this stock

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,720
for

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
this talk is mostly for social engineers

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
that work in an offensive security

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,880
capability the ones that perform attack

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,640
simulations and the one that's the ones

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
that eventually go and inform their

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,119
clients about potential vulnerabilities

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,880
but it is also for the cyber security

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
professionals that are working with the

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,079
human factor and are trying to

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,560
to get along with their nature basically

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
and help them protect themselves and

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,720
their organizations

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,040
either through awareness trainings or

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,560
through the

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,159
the application and protection of

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
policies and better procedures

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,159
but

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,079
it is also for anybody who wants to

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
better understand themselves and who

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,479
wants to better understand others so

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,840
just approach this topic with the

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,878
curious mind and get out of it whatever

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,920
fits your work and personal reality

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,238
better

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
let's start right

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,160
away

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,120
there are

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,200
three important pillars in my opinion

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
when we talk about human behavior and

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,440
social engineering to be effective in

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,200
social engineering first of all we need

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,959
to understand people

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,959
we need to be able to predict their

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,840
behavior to a certain degree because in

68
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,680
reality you can never fully and

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,760
accurately predict how somebody will

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,840
react to something

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
aim to be able to influence their

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
behavior with the biggest probability of

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,440
predictability

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,239
now for a very long time

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
we haven't been focusing as much in

76
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,560
understanding as

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
much as we have been focusing in

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
influence tactics and in the quick and

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
dirty things

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,840
and yes influence principles are very

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,200
good we have been talking about

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
influence principles for a very long

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
time they are highly effective they are

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,040
highly accurate and they are still being

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,480
used but they are not the whole story

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,840
and although i have nothing against them

87
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,680
i yes

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,159
i think that although we should

89
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,799
still teach people about what influence

90
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,720
tactics are and how they are being used

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,599
against them we shouldn't only

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,519
stick with them and feel that our job

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,080
here is done

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
by definition and by principle influence

95
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,120
relies on fundamental psychological

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,000
principles that are hardwired in us and

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,159
that dictates strong behavioral

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,959
tendencies there are fixed action

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,959
patterns or in other words are very

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,120
predictable action reaction patterns

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
and exactly because of this reliability

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,439
they become the quick and dirty tricks

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,040
that we use

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,319
now dr robert gilbini came up with six

105
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,959
of them in his book influence i believe

106
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,519
a lot of you have read it so i will not

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
dive deeper into them in this talk but

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,360
if you haven't read the book definitely

109
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,519
go and pick it up he talked about the

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,920
power of reciprocation consistency

111
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,720
social proof liking authority and

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
scarcity

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,199
we have been using them strategically

114
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,800
and adversaries have been using them

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,520
strategically in most social engineering

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,720
schemes

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,520
as well like along with other principles

118
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,600
like the elements of fear the elements

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
of time pressure

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
etc

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,759
we have been discussing a lot about them

122
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,440
in the industry for a very long time

123
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
anyway and we are not going to discuss

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,080
about them again today but what we are

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,880
going to discuss about is the fact that

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,440
dr kaldeni himself but also the

127
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,280
influence principles are really either

128
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,639
based on the studies and the

129
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,080
yeah and the science of social

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,759
psychology

131
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,120
they are not

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
a distinctive element they have roots on

133
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,759
a lot deeper and larger and

134
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,360
and all their

135
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,919
studies that are stemming from social

136
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,639
psychology

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
i feel that for a very long time we

138
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
skipped the part of understanding people

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,759
and we went straight into applying

140
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,400
the

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
the quick and dirty tricks

142
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,479
and although a lot of attackers do the

143
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,600
same this has started to stop being the

144
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,520
case and that's because social

145
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,560
engineering engagements and attacks have

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,080
evolved

147
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,000
and yes we still have the quick hit and

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
runs the the fishing image that we still

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,600
receive in our inboxes and sometimes

150
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
they work that have an element of fear

151
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
that have the element of time pressure

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,479
and all the usual red flags

153
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,400
yes these are still out there and we

154
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
should still address them but at the

155
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
same time social engineering attacks

156
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,280
have evolved

157
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,680
and they have evolved by

158
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
taking by giving their place to more

159
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
elaborate campaigns

160
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,440
we have longer reconnaissance phases now

161
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,039
social engineering attacks that are a

162
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,960
lot more tailored a lot more

163
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,840
personalized and use more elaborate mind

164
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
games

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,600
lately we have seen deep fakes emerging

166
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
and this is the threat that we

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
see coming and that we know will be a

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
big issue in the years to come but we

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,479
have also seen ongoing persistent

170
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,319
state-sponsored social engineering

171
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,720
campaigns that are more elaborate more

172
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,680
sophisticated and they have

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
a stronger

174
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
psychological background behind them

175
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
that goes beyond influence and

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,520
persuasion techniques and the usual

177
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,639
dirty tricks that we have been using

178
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,919
add to that that people have started to

179
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,759
become aware of influence techniques

180
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,759
some of them are able to recognize them

181
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,720
now and along with the fact that the

182
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,599
defense side has somewhat evolved so

183
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,039
here's the

184
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
offensive side

185
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,360
let's talk about

186
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
the basics first about understanding

187
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
people and let's start for the very very

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,360
basics

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
so that we can then move on to

190
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
how this understanding can help us in

191
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,240
social engineering engagements to both

192
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,479
understand what adversaries do

193
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,639
but to also be able to better simulate

194
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,759
them and protect our clients better

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,160
now one important thing about

196
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,039
everyone about people in general is that

197
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,840
we have two sides in our psychological

198
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,800
makeup

199
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
on the one hand we all share specific

200
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,240
elements in our human hard hardwiring we

201
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,560
all have the same basic needs we all

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
have very strong survival instincts

203
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,160
our social dynamics are more or less the

204
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,520
same although we are in different

205
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
cultures for example we all want to

206
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,840
belong in some sort of group we want to

207
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,080
have a social safety net

208
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,840
trusting relationships loving

209
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,000
relationships the laws of the laws of

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,879
trust throughout cultures are pretty

211
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,960
much the same across everybody

212
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,199
and what is very important

213
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,440
our perception the processes we the

214
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,599
processes we use to perceive our

215
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,919
environment and people around us

216
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,120
are the same across every individual

217
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
our cognitive processes are very similar

218
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,840
but the capabilities are different

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,879
in our biopsychology which is the

220
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
chemicals and hormones we produce in

221
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,919
response to psychological factors are

222
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,039
again the same for example the hormones

223
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,640
and chemicals that i will produce when

224
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
i'm under stress are the same as the

225
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
ones that you will produce when you are

226
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,920
under stress

227
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,120
and that's very interesting because

228
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,480
the hormones in response create

229
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,120
additional psychological effects that

230
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
will be the same

231
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,279
in me they will be the same in you and

232
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,680
you cannot help it and i cannot help it

233
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,279
they will be there and they will affect

234
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,160
me and you the same

235
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,440
and they can be induced and

236
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,080
introduced in the engagements and they

237
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
already are

238
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,839
on the other hand

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
there are the individual elements our

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,760
uniqueness

241
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,040
is based on our genes we are all unique

242
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,959
in the end of the day yes we serve some

243
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,399
characteristics

244
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
but we are also very unique we have

245
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
different genes a different genetically

246
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,360
makeup we have a different upbringing

247
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,519
and environment as we were growing up

248
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,080
which led to past experiences and the

249
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
way these past experiences in

250
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
combination with their genes

251
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
um worked out to beat us into who we are

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,519
today

253
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,880
this in effect has caused the different

254
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,959
individual needs in each and every one

255
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,080
of us different individual weaknesses we

256
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
all have our individual goals and

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
desires

258
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,399
our personality got shaped in its own

259
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,120
unique way as well we shared our own

260
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
unique identity and of course we carry

261
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,839
our own beliefs

262
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,959
and social engineers know that and make

263
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,880
sure to exploit that

264
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
of course there are a lot more aspects

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,440
but now these are the most relevant ones

266
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,600
for this talk

267
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,920
we will start from the very

268
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,720
basic and the very universal human

269
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
wiring

270
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,680
the ones the elements we all share

271
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
and specifically we will look into four

272
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,600
domains the four main domains of study

273
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
that uh that focus on our basic human

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,079
america the way we are able to operate

275
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,000
and interact with others and the way we

276
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,079
perceive our environments and we judge

277
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,040
it

278
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
there are four main domains of study

279
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,200
like i said and i hope that

280
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
since we cannot deep dive into each and

281
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,760
every one of them i hope you will choose

282
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,000
the one that interests you the more

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
the most by the end of this talk and

284
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,959
perhaps dive a little bit deeper into it

285
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,560
and if you want resources you can always

286
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
reach out to me and i will help you

287
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,720
study them

288
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
first of all we look into social

289
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,680
psychology like like i said before

290
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,519
social psychology is the scientific

291
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,000
study of how people think how people

292
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,279
feel and behave in a social context

293
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,680
extremely relevant for social

294
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
engineering attacks

295
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
then second we have perception

296
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
which says that is the way sensory

297
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,440
information is organized interpreted and

298
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,519
consciously experienced

299
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,200
so

300
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
what happens around us and how do we

301
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,399
register this information but beyond

302
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,240
registering this information in our

303
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,959
heads then comes cognition what do we

304
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
think about the information we receive

305
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
and how do we process the information we

306
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
receive through our perception

307
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,040
cognitions that is how people think

308
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,360
all forms of knowing and awareness are

309
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,880
complex perceptual processes conceiving

310
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,920
remembering reasoning how do you reason

311
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,680
an event how do you reason the fact that

312
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,920
you're under pressure in pressuring an

313
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,760
attack during an attack

314
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,079
are judgement

315
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,560
imagining problem solving but also

316
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,360
critical thinking

317
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
and last we look into biopsychology the

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,880
scientific study of the biology of

319
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,519
behavior which

320
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,760
studies again the hormones and the

321
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,480
chemicals we produce as a response to

322
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
certain things that happen in our lives

323
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,839
to certain situations and how these

324
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,399
chemicals and hormones affect our

325
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,320
behavior

326
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,839
and of course we will talk about whether

327
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,959
we can

328
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,760
induce the production of these hormones

329
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,720
and chemicals

330
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
we start

331
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,800
yeah we start by the two

332
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
main things getting back to social

333
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,680
engineering attacks that matter the most

334
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,279
that in a in an attack scenario what do

335
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,000
we count on we count on a good cover

336
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,160
having a good story a good pretext that

337
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,040
is reliable and can be convincing

338
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,279
and we also count in influencing the

339
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,360
target's decision making during an

340
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,240
attack

341
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,880
this is what we say between one another

342
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,120
when we actually

343
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
organize an attack plan

344
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,399
however in reality what happens is that

345
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,279
we rely on a target's decision making

346
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,120
which depends on their perception of the

347
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
situation the perception of the cover

348
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,680
story we will bring to them but also

349
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,399
their cognitive abilities how will they

350
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,279
process discover story and the requests

351
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,880
that we make through the cover story

352
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,639
and because we rely on their perception

353
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,079
of the situation and their cognitive

354
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,880
abilities we will start by talking about

355
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,519
perception

356
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,800
now perception refers to all the

357
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,320
information that we collect through our

358
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,519
senses and the way we interpret them

359
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,000
however the information that we collect

360
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,480
through our senses at any given moment

361
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,320
are simply too many when you enter your

362
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
home and you take a look around you are

363
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,560
not going to analyze whether every

364
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,639
single furniture is in place

365
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,120
however if you see a window open you

366
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,360
will pick it up and you will wonder if

367
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,519
you left this window open or if anybody

368
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,880
else opened it

369
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,440
and you will probably this will act as a

370
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,120
trigger for you to search around the

371
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
house a little bit

372
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,040
so we do not process all sensory

373
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
information because it's extremely

374
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
energy consuming and people

375
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,920
and actually every living creature tries

376
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,839
to save energy and not spend it

377
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,440
endlessly so we do not process all

378
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,079
sensitive information but we will spend

379
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,519
energy aka cognitive power

380
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,639
mostly on what we consider important

381
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,880
and what we prioritize

382
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,240
and of course our well-being and

383
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,160
survival is something we prioritize

384
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
but also our work and our daily

385
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,680
activities and certain things that we as

386
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,440
individuals find important are things

387
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,279
that we prioritize and we will spend

388
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,800
more energy on

389
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,480
however on your day-to-day and for

390
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,360
example

391
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
when you are in a busy station

392
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,079
yes you will pay attention to what is

393
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,560
happening around you but you will not

394
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,639
spend time analyzing every single

395
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,480
individual that passes by because there

396
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,199
are simply too many and you will end up

397
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,560
being exhausted after an hour or two

398
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,920
perception is

399
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,120
very useful but it's also a very ironic

400
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,160
function

401
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,399
so from the one hand it enables us to

402
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,720
scan and evaluate our environments in

403
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,199
the circumstances we encounter

404
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,600
it does let us know if there is a threat

405
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,759
if we are safe if there is anything that

406
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,680
requires our attention

407
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
but at the same time it is a pretty

408
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,920
quick and complex process and it does

409
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,440
not require much energy not much energy

410
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
nor does it require any analytical

411
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
capabilities

412
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,839
so like we said in a train station you

413
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,959
will

414
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,279
just scan around to see if everything is

415
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,560
okay and you will only spend

416
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,759
cognitive power if you see to analyze

417
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,120
something a little better if you see

418
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,360
someone running around suddenly

419
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,720
you your

420
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,720
your vision will automatically

421
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
yeah focus on them to see whether they

422
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,680
run to catch a train or whether they run

423
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
because something happened or if someone

424
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,279
screams which is something that

425
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,680
is not very difficult in the chain

426
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,440
station for example

427
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,839
everything else you will blare out a

428
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,399
little bit you will go through

429
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
to your destination

430
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
and that's it it is basically a highly

431
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,959
automated process that relies on

432
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,040
appearances on whether everything

433
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,920
generally looks okay and on snap

434
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,120
judgments

435
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,160
in basement judgments i mean very very

436
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,240
quick snap judgments

437
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,959
in fact our brain has developed energy

438
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,280
saving capabilities that help us judge

439
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,640
situations and people very fast and draw

440
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
conclusions about them

441
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,839
with minimal effort

442
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,839
now that's important for social

443
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,199
engineers why because most of the time

444
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,319
in

445
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,959
you know in their in attacks during

446
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,919
engagements they want to appear

447
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,880
inconspicuous

448
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,559
or they want to look like they belong

449
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,799
and they blend in

450
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,760
that means that they try to pass under

451
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,480
the perceptual threshold yeah somebody

452
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
will notice you but they will not spend

453
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
time on you to actually analyze why

454
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
you're there or who you are

455
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,559
on the other hand if you want to get the

456
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
target to be attracted to you because

457
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
this is what your pretext requires and

458
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,200
you want to engage with them still you

459
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,880
use perception to make the target

460
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
attracted to you and to try to deliver

461
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,039
subliminal messages about who you are

462
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,720
and about whether

463
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
what you look like supports your story

464
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,320
case in point

465
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,360
we see these two people

466
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,160
who do you think is more successful and

467
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
i don't want you to

468
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,120
chew too much on this thought just as a

469
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,880
snap judgment who would you say is more

470
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,120
successful who would you say is more

471
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
reliable

472
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,799
and who would you say as an opinion that

473
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,280
you can trust

474
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,280
most people tend to reply that it's

475
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
actually the blonde lady

476
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
and that's because of a very interesting

477
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,600
phenomenon

478
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,080
called the halo effect

479
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
the hail effect is a cognitive bias

480
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,120
that causes our impression

481
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
snap judgment

482
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,039
of someone on one domain to influence

483
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,000
our impressions of them on other domains

484
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,120
there are

485
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,000
hundreds of studies done on the halo

486
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,200
effect that eventually point out that we

487
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,919
scan an individual and we just look at

488
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,640
the

489
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,880
the most dominant characteristics how

490
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,120
they are dressed how they are groomed

491
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,679
and how their body language looks like

492
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,679
and if they are for example well dressed

493
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,919
well groomed we automatically assign

494
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,559
also personality traits in them like

495
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,200
reliability trustworthiness

496
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,039
we judge whether they are successful or

497
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,480
not whether they are someone whose

498
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,400
opinion we want

499
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
are the exact opposite

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,240
social engineers sometimes use that to

501
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
their advantage so that they can either

502
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,760
appear more trustworthy than they are or

503
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,320
just blend in and

504
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440
and not

505
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
make you look at them

506
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,600
for example

507
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,840
we have uh

508
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,760
we have this uh lady from a from a

509
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
series called the americans some of you

510
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
might have watched it and we have six of

511
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,039
her disguises in the middle we see how

512
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,679
she looks originally in this series and

513
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,919
the other six personas are her

514
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,559
her disguises in the operations she was

515
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,159
running she was supposed to be a spy in

516
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,679
the series

517
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,559
now

518
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,799
again by forming snap judgments by

519
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,880
seeing this person somewhere in an

520
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,600
environment

521
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,640
i

522
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,240
by looking at the different disguises

523
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,200
you would be able to tell which one of

524
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,760
them is the one that brings rabbit

525
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,720
you would be able to tell and probably

526
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,559
most of you would

527
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,360
pick

528
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
the same or very similar ones if i asked

529
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
you to point out the one that looks the

530
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,240
most innocent and harmless

531
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,559
the ones that looks almost

532
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,880
foolish i would say the one that looks

533
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,080
flirty

534
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,679
or the one that looks like a very

535
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,200
serious professional that you are not

536
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
supposed to mess with

537
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,919
and most of you would pick the same

538
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,840
people to all of these answers

539
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
every impersonator uses this not every

540
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,520
but many the good ones

541
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,280
use these perceptual snap judgments and

542
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,440
they implement them in their disguises

543
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,000
so that they can have a good basis and

544
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,720
they can breed a good and beneficial

545
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
ground to them

546
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,880
the same happens with the males

547
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,600
we have a few disguises of the same one

548
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,679
and again probably most of you would

549
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,840
pick the same choices if i asked you who

550
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,320
is the one that works from nine to five

551
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,360
and

552
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,880
doesn't really harm a fly

553
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,120
who is the one who causes the trouble

554
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,799
and could be perceived as a little bit

555
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,440
of a threat in an environment or who is

556
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,679
the one that likes to chop woods in a

557
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,440
forest every thursday evening

558
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
that's because

559
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,080
the halo effect and this cognitive bias

560
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,000
is mainly working through stereotypes

561
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
and through what society has taught us

562
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,039
it is a bit unfortunate but at the same

563
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,760
time it's just a coping mechanisms

564
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,880
mechanism so that you can scan a number

565
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,919
of people fast and effectively without

566
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,400
spending energy so what your brain does

567
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
is that it says i will pick specific

568
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,880
characteristics and i will rely and over

569
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,440
generalize based on them and they it

570
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,280
will only go into cognitive and

571
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,600
analytical work if it feels i need to do

572
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,918
so

573
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,240
when it comes to disguises just for the

574
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
sake of mentioning it as well if you

575
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,720
ever come to use a disguise

576
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,640
what the brain perceives are the

577
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,280
characteristics that stand out the most

578
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,679
for example hair clothes and body

579
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,159
language and the rest of the features

580
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,400
like the eyes the lips and the shape of

581
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,760
the face

582
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,919
they are a little bit more secondary

583
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,720
your

584
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,159
your perceptual brain will not stick

585
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,480
with them too much and they are also the

586
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,120
ones that are either the easiest either

587
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,159
through makeup through the lipsticks

588
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,640
um your lipsticks through facial hair

589
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,159
for men through haircuts and through

590
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,960
changing outfits or wearing gases

591
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
all these accessories can alter how you

592
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,280
look like but and they can also alter

593
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,200
the way you are perceived by somebody

594
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,630
else

595
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,799
[Music]

596
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
now is this useful only for

597
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
impersonations and for

598
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,039
attacks or attack simulations that have

599
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,080
to

600
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,000
that are happening in person

601
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
no they are not in fact they are also

602
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
being used in the construction of sock

603
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
puppet accounts

604
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,000
the sock puppet account miash

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
she

606
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,559
she was built by an apt group

607
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,039
and she was operating for a couple of

608
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,760
years i believe i am being very very

609
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,080
effective with her targets now they

610
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,960
chose this picture for their soft public

611
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,600
and i believe they chose it for a reason

612
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,919
how would you perceive mia ash based on

613
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,799
how she looks she is lying down her

614
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,039
she's exposing her neck

615
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,159
it's a pretty

616
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,200
vulnerable position to be in i would say

617
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,360
so basically she wants to look

618
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,960
non-threatening

619
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,880
definitely non-threatening because this

620
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,919
is an extremely valuable position

621
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,880
and

622
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,960
maybe a bit inviting for a conversation

623
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,679
these principles are used in

624
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,440
in the crafting of social engineering

625
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,640
personas regularly and the goal is to

626
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,480
either bypass the brain's cognitive

627
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,440
failures or just not to raise any

628
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,640
suspicions and try to drive a specific

629
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,120
message in a very subliminal way that

630
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,360
the person that is

631
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,799
targeted will not necessarily

632
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,559
analyze and critically think on

633
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,880
the same happens with trust a current

634
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,840
element of social engineering

635
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
attacks and again there are many studies

636
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,559
on what we assign trust on and who do we

637
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,880
assign trustworthiness on and that's

638
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,799
usually on people who look happy and

639
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,039
relaxed in an encounter

640
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,520
she looks very relaxed

641
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,400
people who have a calm and steady voice

642
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,279
who appear to be like us because

643
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,880
when somebody looks like us we

644
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,279
automatically that's another cognitive

645
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,039
bias we assign to them the same

646
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,720
characteristics that we have we feel

647
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
like they belong to our tribe and like

648
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,840
we could befriend them much easier

649
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,600
or

650
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,320
when they have unexpected behavior under

651
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,120
specific circumstances

652
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,200
in this expected behavior under specific

653
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
circumstances is another interesting

654
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,559
story here when it comes to perception

655
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,880
now like we said our brain will spend

656
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,440
energy and cognitive power when

657
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,520
analyzing a situation only when they

658
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,799
have to

659
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,400
at the same time when we are in an

660
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,159
environment virtual or physical each of

661
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,880
us has a specific preset notion about

662
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,720
the behavioral skills that people are

663
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,400
meant to play within that specific

664
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,159
environment or situation

665
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,640
for example when you go to the pool you

666
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
and everybody else

667
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,200
are expected to walk into the the locker

668
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,679
room to take off your shoes to change

669
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,000
into your swimming suits and wear your

670
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
swimming hat

671
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
and then leave all of your belongings in

672
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,120
the locking room and go just with your

673
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,520
swimming suit and a towel out in the

674
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,919
pool area and try to keep it clean

675
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,200
either you wear either flip-flops or you

676
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,039
go barefoot but generally you do not

677
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,880
wear your

678
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,120
your outdoor shoes

679
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,039
that's a behavioral that's a very clear

680
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,720
behavioral script and if anybody

681
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,679
violates that well all the others pick

682
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,400
up on it and um they are usually not

683
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
very happy

684
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,880
but generally they they noticed it

685
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,559
immediately i would say

686
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,360
now if you follow the behavioral script

687
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,919
you slide by the perceptual filter you

688
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,159
are under the threshold

689
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,000
of

690
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,720
noteworthiness

691
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,039
to put it this way at the same time if

692
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,440
you want to draw attention if you have

693
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,080
to get into an encounter with someone

694
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,159
and steal you for a lo the appropriate

695
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,120
behavioral script for your pretext then

696
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,960
again you're good because you might

697
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,360
encounter someone but still not make

698
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,120
them

699
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,600
analyze your question you more because

700
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,440
you are following the guidelines that

701
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,200
are expected

702
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,559
and therefore it is important to be

703
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,159
aware of the social setting you are

704
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,399
operating in and the local scripts of

705
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,919
behavior so that you can better look

706
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,919
like you belong in them

707
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,000
two very classic examples from our

708
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,880
industry are tailgating blending in with

709
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,440
people who pass through a security door

710
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,640
at the time they are passing through a

711
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
security tower looking like them walking

712
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,919
like them

713
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,000
being comfortable and calm following the

714
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,480
behavioral script and getting through

715
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,559
because you look like you belong

716
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,360
or impersonating

717
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,320
i know especially today today especially

718
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,600
these days

719
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,760
and now that at least in germany people

720
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
are transitioning back to the office we

721
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,320
have the situation where

722
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,200
only 20 of the personnel are in the

723
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,440
office buildings and there have been a

724
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,600
lot of new hires or layoffs in the

725
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
meantime

726
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,399
something we have noticed with clients

727
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,480
is that employees don't know anymore who

728
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,720
belongs in the building and who doesn't

729
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,960
so if you walk in the building and you

730
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
pretend to belong there and to be one of

731
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,320
the employees and you follow the

732
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,200
behavioral scripts of that

733
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,279
company and the way other people move in

734
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,440
the company

735
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,640
usually you can get into rooms and into

736
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,520
offices you wouldn't be able to go to

737
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,279
otherwise because people would know you

738
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,720
don't belong there

739
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,039
but now that there is a certainty about

740
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,320
who is

741
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,760
who is a co-worker and who is not

742
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,240
yeah it's much easier to walk in and i

743
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,520
would advise

744
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,279
people and

745
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,000
companies to make sure that employees

746
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,640
lock their offices before they leave

747
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,080
right now because there is a lot of

748
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,960
uncertainty when it comes to who enters

749
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,760
buildings or not

750
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,600
other practical applications on whether

751
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,720
you can bypass the perceptual filters or

752
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,600
not

753
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,799
and

754
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,240
how you can

755
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,880
manipulate these snap judgments they are

756
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,080
of course the on-site attack simulations

757
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
when you try to blend in not have

758
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,399
anybody question why you are there or

759
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,720
when they question you to not think more

760
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,679
of just the basics

761
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,279
in sock puppet accounts conducting

762
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,279
online monitoring for example i know

763
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,039
some of the open source intelligence

764
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,919
specialists that we have in the industry

765
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,679
when they want to infiltrate and

766
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,080
passively monitor a group they will look

767
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
into who is the average joe of that

768
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,880
group

769
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,640
and they will construct a stockpuppet

770
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,200
account that looks like the average joe

771
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,399
and that's because they don't want to

772
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,559
raise any suspicions and they don't want

773
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,960
to to make the admins of that group or

774
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,480
other members

775
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,399
look more into them they don't want to

776
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,480
stand out

777
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,799
again these perceptual filters are used

778
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,000
in human human intelligence operations

779
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,880
like we saw in the case of mia ash mia

780
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,360
ash was engaging with her targets for a

781
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,240
long time both withdrawing information

782
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,159
for them but also eventually exploiting

783
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,520
them

784
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,080
by sending malicious attachments

785
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,720
and they are being used in facing attack

786
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,120
simulations by trying

787
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,320
to

788
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,520
by trying to impersonate

789
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,080
others but also use the way they walk

790
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,799
the way they behave to use information

791
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,360
that is relevant to current situations

792
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,679
and generally try to look like you

793
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,880
belong

794
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
um

795
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,880
but there will come the time

796
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,760
that somebody will question why you are

797
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,000
in a specific area or they will question

798
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,960
your intentions in general and this is

799
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,360
when cognition and

800
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,679
cognitive processes analyzing critical

801
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,080
thinking start to appear and things

802
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,760
become a little more difficult

803
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,399
when do people move from perceiving a

804
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,480
personal situation to

805
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,679
to using analytical thinking

806
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,919
they will use analytical thinking when

807
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,240
something messes with their priorities

808
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,039
or is a priority to them

809
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,760
or when their attention

810
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,480
happens to fall on that

811
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,720
person or situation when it draws the

812
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,480
attention for some reason like we said

813
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,039
before with perception when something

814
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,120
doesn't follow the behavioral scripts or

815
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,279
what is expected or generally stands out

816
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,480
a little bit

817
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,559
it it automatically somehow draws our

818
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,039
attention and we look at it

819
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,440
let's start from the priorities yes we

820
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,480
pay more attention to what we prioritize

821
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,640
it's a bit logical as well

822
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,559
we want to get our job done on a

823
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,880
day-to-day we pay attention to to our

824
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,799
families because families tend to be a

825
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,919
priority i we pay

826
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,840
we pay attention to our personal needs

827
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,679
because they are a natural automatic

828
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,279
priority and generally other information

829
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,279
may fit in the background if it is

830
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,679
irrelevant to what

831
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,760
we need for our lives to go through our

832
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,320
lives then your brain will not want to

833
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,960
spend extra energy on dealing with it

834
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,240
this can be useful for engagements

835
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
especially when you find out that

836
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,399
certain employees don't care about their

837
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,000
job

838
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,240
when you perform reconnaissance or open

839
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,559
source intelligence research and you

840
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,880
identify that people are not interested

841
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,279
in their workplace you can also be sure

842
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,679
that they do not prioritize security

843
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,919
either so they automatically become low

844
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,039
hanging fruits and easy targets because

845
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,919
they will just not spend the cognitive

846
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,690
energy required to try and

847
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,760
[Music]

848
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,080
protect their organizations if they

849
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,200
don't have

850
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
personal stakes in it

851
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,679
on the other hand another thing that we

852
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,080
do is that we look into employer review

853
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,919
sites and we look for the departments

854
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,440
that happen to be under a lot of stress

855
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,679
that's why that's because when people or

856
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,279
departments

857
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,200
are under a lot of stress and under a

858
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,840
lot of pressure that stress tends to

859
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,000
become a priority the focus of their

860
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,320
attention and like we said everything

861
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,039
else may fade in the background if you

862
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,200
already have a lot on your plate you're

863
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,399
simply

864
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,519
not going to do the extra effort and run

865
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,440
the extra mile to keep an organization

866
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,559
secure if you can just um make a snap

867
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,760
judgment a snap decision and move on

868
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,399
to to the stressor to the situation and

869
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,919
the task that is stressing you out and

870
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,640
you want to get out of your plate

871
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,799
so departments with extreme person

872
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,799
pressure or stress

873
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,360
are also relatively vulnerable

874
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,919
and then we move on to attention

875
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,399
attention yes we may pay attention to

876
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,159
something and try to analyze it and

877
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,320
cognitively think about it but we are

878
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,000
only humans our capabilities are limited

879
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,280
and

880
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,918
therefore attention is nothing but a

881
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,320
shining light to what is relevant to the

882
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,719
person we look at what we pay attention

883
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,040
to and we filter out there is they blare

884
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,280
out in the background

885
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,000
as a social engineer you either want to

886
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,599
bring attention to you so that you can

887
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,320
engage the target and make them

888
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,879
do something for you or you want to

889
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,239
blare out like we said

890
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,918
there are attention

891
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,399
failures when we have to process too

892
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,399
much information which means that we are

893
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,639
more susceptible to the power of

894
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,800
suggestion by somebody else

895
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,119
on or when we are multitasking because

896
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,440
again our energy is limited our

897
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,199
abilities are limited and when you

898
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,200
multitask i know there are people that

899
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,680
say they can multitask just fine

900
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,359
but the reality is that you spread

901
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,119
yourself too thin especially when it

902
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,960
comes to your attention and cognitive

903
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
processing

904
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,760
a big and important exception here are

905
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,079
the individuals that are trained or have

906
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:14,880
the

907
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,839
the ability the genetical ability to

908
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,160
have an exceptional situational

909
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
awareness level

910
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
they are the ones that develop their

911
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,200
covert attention that includes a much

912
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,960
broader spectrum of information

913
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,280
receptiveness and processing

914
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,000
a representative example here are

915
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,240
in the domain of security guards

916
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,760
we have probably always seen the

917
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,920
security guards that just go through the

918
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,880
day they don't really care about their

919
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,560
work they just sit there

920
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,200
their presence is there to make a point

921
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,720
but

922
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,480
but they will not really pay attention

923
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,920
to what is happening around they just

924
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,839
exist in the space they are the ones who

925
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,160
look around who like i look up at the

926
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,520
ceiling who count the ties on the floor

927
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,839
and just wait for time to pass by

928
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,640
and

929
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,359
i believe you can tell who they are

930
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,800
and then there are the ones that are

931
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,440
trained that are focused some of them

932
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,079
working work in close protection and

933
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,240
these are the ones who are usually

934
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,560
sitting still looking straight or just

935
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,480
looking around but you can tell they

936
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,920
scan you

937
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,520
they scan you and you can tell that they

938
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,839
also use their peripheral vision they

939
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,240
see a lot more than just what is in

940
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,200
front of them they perceive a lot more

941
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,040
about their environment and they use

942
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,520
also their other senses like hearing

943
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
people that have exceptional situational

944
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,320
awareness level and are trained to

945
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,960
notice

946
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,720
inconsistencies will stop you and will

947
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,359
ask you and you will be put in a hotseat

948
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,599
to have to prove who you are and why you

949
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,920
are there and why you try to engage

950
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,680
someone and ask

951
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,359
them to do things for you or ask for

952
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,319
questions ask questions

953
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,280
this is when cognitive analysis takes

954
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,960
place it doesn't have to be a security

955
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
guard there are certain people within

956
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,040
companies that have this ability as well

957
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,599
or that are well trained

958
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,640
and and are able to process

959
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,599
the fact that you don't belong there

960
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,839
like we said earlier cognition focuses

961
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,320
on how people think all forms of knowing

962
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,560
and awareness or complex perception

963
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,040
processes processes yeah

964
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,079
i conceiving remembering reasoning

965
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,359
judging

966
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,440
imagining and problem solving but there

967
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,760
is one caveat

968
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,920
yes we receive information through our

969
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,680
senses and through our perceptual

970
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,880
abilities

971
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
but they get filtered through

972
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,040
three main elements our previous

973
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,240
experiences our knowledge

974
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,920
and our emotions

975
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,880
and based on these three failures

976
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,920
you end up with your thinking outcomes

977
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,320
now you can imagine that uh an employee

978
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,720
that got only trained for half an hour

979
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,599
once per year does not have enough

980
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,000
memory of the training and therefore i

981
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,359
could argue that he doesn't have

982
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,280
sufficient knowledge to filter out the

983
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,320
red flags to recognize the red flags and

984
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,240
then on the one hand he could see

985
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,160
something that he would perceive as a

986
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,280
species

987
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,000
but the thinking outcome would tell him

988
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,839
you don't know enough about this you are

989
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,079
uncertain drop it and focus on your

990
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,599
other priorities

991
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,760
now on the other hand a weight trained

992
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,079
individual someone that got their

993
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,240
license to through training that has the

994
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,280
whole

995
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,960
topic of social engineering and the red

996
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,920
flags

997
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,960
way stuck in their heads we feel they're

998
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,480
a perceptual

999
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,960
sensation something that they see as

1000
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,880
suspicious through

1001
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,359
that knowledge

1002
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,760
and they will realize that oh i remember

1003
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,440
this this person is not supposed to be

1004
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
doing that or this person is not

1005
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,720
supposed to be asking that and this is

1006
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
where i draw a boundary or this is where

1007
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,000
i report it or this is where i ask them

1008
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,079
why they're here and the thinking

1009
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,280
outcomes completely different

1010
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,000
so knowledge is extremely important

1011
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,079
and cognitive filtering is extremely

1012
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,800
important yes social engineering becomes

1013
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,359
a lot more complicated when the target

1014
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,599
engages in cognitive processes and this

1015
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,079
is something that they usually don't

1016
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,320
want and this is something that usually

1017
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,839
scares them

1018
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,040
and scares us if we have to learn to

1019
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,200
to during the engagement although it

1020
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,160
mostly makes me happy if people

1021
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,240
sit and think

1022
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,680
the indications that someone is

1023
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,839
evaluating you are that they pause and

1024
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,160
think before they speak

1025
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,720
this is when the first drops of sweat

1026
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,640
start to come down from the attacker

1027
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,720
if they ask questions why are you here

1028
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,280
why are you asking this um do you have

1029
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,440
some proof that you're meant to be here

1030
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,920
etc and if they do not grant you your

1031
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,680
wishes oh you need this piece of

1032
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,839
information i'm sorry but i cannot

1033
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,400
provide it

1034
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,359
usually the internal questions that this

1035
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,440
other person has during a first

1036
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,760
encounter the target

1037
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,680
four of them stem from christopher had

1038
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,839
nagi in his book social engineering the

1039
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,319
science of human hacking and they i have

1040
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,680
found in my experience that they are

1041
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,599
very accurate as well

1042
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,400
they will wonder who this person is

1043
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,760
what do they want are they threats is

1044
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,000
what they ask suspicious is something

1045
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,240
that could put me into trouble and how

1046
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,079
long will this take because in the end

1047
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,680
of the day i have so many other things i

1048
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,079
need to take care of

1049
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,720
however i have also noticed in my

1050
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,839
experience that another very dominant

1051
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,880
question

1052
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,440
that people will subconsciously consider

1053
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,760
when encountering you and when

1054
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,359
coming

1055
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,200
in touch with the request that you make

1056
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,319
as a social engineer is what is in it

1057
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,480
for me

1058
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,119
so you asked me to give you this access

1059
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,800
but

1060
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,200
i don't know who i don't know if

1061
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,119
i have to because i don't know if not

1062
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,640
giving it to you would put me into a

1063
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,640
travel which is something that i don't

1064
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,520
want

1065
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,079
i and i still don't know if giving this

1066
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,319
access to you will cause any benefit to

1067
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,720
me so if there isn't no real benefit to

1068
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,040
me i i might as well play it safe and

1069
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,440
not provide access but if you clearly

1070
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,839
communicate that i will be put into

1071
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,240
trouble or that i really

1072
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,760
need to give you this access because you

1073
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,119
will run some update classic scenario

1074
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,119
for me that will help me in my work then

1075
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,359
my reinforcement is much higher to

1076
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,560
comply with this request

1077
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,680
people will not necessarily ask you

1078
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,760
these questions

1079
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,240
out loud in an engagement but they will

1080
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,880
run subconsciously and you are

1081
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,720
supposed to

1082
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,640
to answer them

1083
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,800
do not underestimate communication

1084
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,200
capabilities and the power of suggestion

1085
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,400
because it has the ability to influence

1086
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,240
cognitive processes and change the frame

1087
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,599
so as a

1088
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,359
rule of thumb it's good to have a good

1089
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,599
pretext to anticipate the target's

1090
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,520
internal questions and address them

1091
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,160
before they make the effort to ask them

1092
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,880
because they think about them anyway

1093
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,160
and last

1094
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,800
if you are putting a hot seat and if you

1095
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,480
can control certain

1096
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,040
situational and emotional factors before

1097
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,280
an engagement i would say do so

1098
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,520
do so because

1099
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,760
biopsychology

1100
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,319
plays a big role in our day-to-day

1101
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,480
activities and the way our brain works

1102
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,720
in the way we take decisions

1103
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,200
and it can be influenced and it can

1104
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,400
hijack cognitive capabilities and the

1105
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,359
cognitive processes

1106
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,119
like we said before

1107
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,280
biopsychology is a scientific study of

1108
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,520
the biology of behavior and it is

1109
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,920
primarily based on

1110
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,040
hormones

1111
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,880
and chemicals that are being created

1112
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,119
through emotions

1113
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,599
through stress or through the lack of

1114
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,760
sleep or overall fatigue the person

1115
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,920
might have obviously they are not the

1116
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
only ones but these are the ones that

1117
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,800
are most relevant right now for

1118
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,560
social engineering engagements and what

1119
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,000
we talk about

1120
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,079
the simplest and most straightforward of

1121
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,079
them all is the lack of sleep

1122
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,560
when we are in a state of fatigue and

1123
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,040
general tiredness we simply do not

1124
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,200
process information the same way our

1125
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,920
energy is a lot more limited so again

1126
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,760
you can imagine we cannot focus our

1127
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,920
attention too much on one thing we

1128
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,440
cannot

1129
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,520
we cannot produce critical thinking with

1130
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,680
the same efficiency and accuracy that we

1131
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,560
would if we were rested and so on and so

1132
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,040
forth so a lot of little details might

1133
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
slide by simply because there is not

1134
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,240
enough

1135
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
energy

1136
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,118
not enough energy

1137
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,640
emotions emotions

1138
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,640
are

1139
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,280
hormone factories basically

1140
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,000
and that's why i believe all of you are

1141
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,720
familiar with uh with the phrase i could

1142
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,640
not think straight i could not think

1143
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,480
straight from people that were either

1144
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,240
facing extreme positive emotions or

1145
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,000
bad emotions emotions have the tendency

1146
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,640
to trigger different priorities and

1147
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,319
introduce new motivations in situations

1148
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,400
for example if

1149
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,800
if you approach

1150
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,880
if you approach somebody that causes

1151
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,319
positive

1152
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,000
emotions to you

1153
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,240
if you like them if you are able to be

1154
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,839
if they are able actually to beat

1155
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,520
rapport with you

1156
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,359
and um

1157
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,839
and you have a good time with them you

1158
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:54,400
produce dopamine serotonin and oxytocin

1159
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,839
and the tricky thing about these

1160
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,319
hormones is that they are very addictive

1161
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,920
you want to have more and more of them

1162
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,240
you don't want the to stop the

1163
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,000
production of these hormones and they

1164
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,079
are really rewarded rewarding

1165
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,920
these are the hormones that give you

1166
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,800
what we call rose-colored glasses which

1167
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,480
means that you are more likely to turn a

1168
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,760
blind eye when somebody you like

1169
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,160
suddenly raises a red flag or when they

1170
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,680
do something they are not supposed to do

1171
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,359
or when they ask you for something you

1172
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,280
are not supposed to do

1173
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,280
you are more likely to complain first of

1174
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,119
all because you like this person you

1175
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,040
want to be consistent and you want to

1176
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,960
keep liking them now especially if they

1177
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,599
have established themselves as someone

1178
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,800
that um

1179
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,119
that has won you over

1180
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,560
and you don't want to stop the

1181
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,319
production of these hormones because

1182
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,760
that's

1183
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,760
that's not a happy place to be and you

1184
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,200
also have to tell yourself that you were

1185
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,880
wrong something we can not want to do

1186
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,480
then on the other hand when we are

1187
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,240
introduced with negative emotions like

1188
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
fear and tension

1189
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,599
we trigger automatic avoidance responses

1190
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,000
we produce cortisol and adrenaline which

1191
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,400
tell our bodies that we are faced with a

1192
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,240
with an emergency situation that we need

1193
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,480
to do something about it and avoid these

1194
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,720
negative emotions and what do social

1195
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,040
engineers do they induce that negative

1196
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,200
emotion for example fear and then they

1197
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,040
provide them way out and their way out

1198
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,839
is usually

1199
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,200
usually leads to exploitation for

1200
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,000
example the emails that induce fear your

1201
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,079
account will be deleted and you have to

1202
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,800
click on that link the link is your way

1203
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,839
out of that emotion

1204
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,280
similarly

1205
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,160
the

1206
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,240
stress works

1207
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,319
in a very similar way it makes the body

1208
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,359
believe

1209
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,319
and act as if there is an emergency

1210
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,400
and therefore your brain

1211
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,680
your mind

1212
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,760
and your body they get occupied with

1213
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,599
this emergency you have to deal with

1214
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,839
that stressor you have to resolve the

1215
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,560
stressor and you have to move out of the

1216
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,359
stressful situation so

1217
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,800
priorities shift your attention shifts

1218
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,880
you pay a lot more attention in what is

1219
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,640
causing you this distress and you try to

1220
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,040
resolve it this way blaring out

1221
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,359
everything else and letting little red

1222
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,280
flags slide out just because you do not

1223
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,040
have the mental capacity to deal with

1224
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,319
that as well

1225
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,720
your cognitive processes we under

1226
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,160
function

1227
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,680
for example if you are a person that

1228
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,839
generally wants to eat healthy and does

1229
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,839
the effort to eat healthy you might have

1230
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,000
noticed that when you get under stress

1231
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,640
suddenly you will start opting for more

1232
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,520
junk food for solutions that are

1233
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,440
quick and easy just because you cannot

1234
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,599
deal with additional

1235
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,920
mental workload you cannot think about

1236
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,760
what you are going to eat today

1237
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,280
you already have too much on your plate

1238
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,920
so you will opt for whatever is nearby

1239
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,319
quick easy and finish with it and you

1240
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,480
will have this approach with other

1241
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,160
things in life as well stress has

1242
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,960
the power to dominate over a whole lot

1243
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,040
of other priorities that we have in life

1244
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,800
now imagine this in the context of a

1245
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,680
social engineering engagement

1246
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,720
situational variable variables can make

1247
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,200
a whole lot of difference in the outcome

1248
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,040
of the behavior and a whole lot of

1249
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,079
difference

1250
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,559
in an engagement in social engineering

1251
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:27,839
engagement

1252
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,400
imagine introducing a stressor or a

1253
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,160
diver a diversion before or during an

1254
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,000
encounter with a target

1255
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
we had this very famous example of a

1256
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,319
social engineering vision called with a

1257
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,480
baby cry in the background and this

1258
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,000
works away because our bodies are so in

1259
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,359
tune to

1260
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,160
to get alerting alerted and stressed out

1261
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,920
when we hear a baby cry and we want to

1262
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,240
make it so really bad it's part of our

1263
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,000
hard wiring

1264
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,839
imagine into

1265
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,160
using what we said before by selecting

1266
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,160
the right timing for example fridays

1267
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,680
when everybody

1268
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,800
is tired a priori the priority of the

1269
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,440
time is to finish off with work and go

1270
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,559
home

1271
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,079
and take a rest or imagine if you

1272
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,359
um

1273
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,440
yeah if you initiate the social

1274
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,280
engineering attack on a monday morning

1275
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,839
when everybody is really busy and they

1276
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,200
have to deal with the image from the

1277
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,760
weekend and just try to

1278
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,800
set off the week

1279
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
by putting as many things under control

1280
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,000
as possible

1281
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,200
and last

1282
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,119
imagine if in your pre-text and in your

1283
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,680
attack scenario you introduce emotional

1284
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,319
variables like likability or fear

1285
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,359
depending on your pretext

1286
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,680
it has a tendency to

1287
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,280
to produce

1288
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,680
hormones and chemicals and to hijack a

1289
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,400
lot of cognitive abilities

1290
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,079
and unfortunately there is not too much

1291
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,280
that we can do

1292
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,119
about it

1293
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,680
or is it

1294
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,960
this whole

1295
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,599
section i know sounds very gloomy for

1296
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,079
all of us that also work in a defensive

1297
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,200
capacity that want to protect humans

1298
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,599
and somehow i know that i'm here telling

1299
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,559
you how many limits we have as human

1300
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,920
beings

1301
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,280
and how

1302
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,200
easy it is to

1303
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,319
to manipulate these limits unfortunately

1304
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,720
but there are also good news

1305
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,079
because whatever

1306
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,240
we know and learn

1307
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,760
that is being used in an offensive

1308
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,880
capacity we can also try to take into

1309
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,319
account

1310
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,760
when we develop a defensive strategy and

1311
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,680
i think that this is something we

1312
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,800
haven't really done as an industry we

1313
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,880
haven't taken into account

1314
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,680
the human capabilities and limitations

1315
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,800
and we just

1316
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,680
go around introducing whatever strategy

1317
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,000
we have in mind without

1318
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,400
keeping into account how people are

1319
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,200
really made how they operate what they

1320
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,559
can do

1321
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,760
however part of the solution lies again

1322
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,839
in

1323
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,200
biopsychology and in the fact that our

1324
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,760
brains are capable of creating new

1325
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,760
behavioral pathways

1326
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,240
new security habits

1327
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,880
that can become automatic

1328
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,920
and this

1329
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,720
is very good news

1330
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,559
the way our professor explained

1331
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,480
neuroplasticity

1332
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,400
back in the days that i was in college

1333
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,359
was as an undefined path

1334
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,839
and she told us that basically every new

1335
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,480
skill that we learn with every new skill

1336
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,760
it's like we are we are carving a new

1337
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,079
mental pathway in the beginning there is

1338
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,040
no path you have to put a lot of effort

1339
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,880
into figuring out an energy into

1340
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,520
figuring out where to go

1341
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,480
and in which direction to move and how

1342
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
but eventually the more you practice

1343
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,520
this

1344
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,559
this skill the the deeper this path

1345
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,640
becomes and the clearer it becomes until

1346
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,880
at some point you have a very clear

1347
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,480
mental pathway

1348
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,880
and you do not have to spend any effort

1349
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,960
any cognitive capability and it's just

1350
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,040
an automatic path that

1351
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,480
you follow and that's it and it happens

1352
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,640
it just happens automatically and that's

1353
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,040
what we want with people when they come

1354
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,280
across social engineering attacks we

1355
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,359
want them to be able to recognize red

1356
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,319
flags and we want these red flags to act

1357
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,119
like cognitive triggers which means that

1358
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,839
i see it and i don't spend any time

1359
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,040
trying to

1360
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,960
figure out whether i should comply or

1361
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,200
not with this individual and i just set

1362
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,599
directly a clear boundary because i

1363
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,760
understand that i am not supposed to

1364
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,000
give credentials for example through the

1365
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,559
phone or i am not supposed to let

1366
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,200
anybody in specific rooms other than

1367
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,280
person abc

1368
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,640
and a lot more things like i

1369
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,640
automatically lock my

1370
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,000
screen when i leave the office i

1371
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
automatically lock the office itself i

1372
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,240
do not plug usbs and a lot

1373
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,079
more elaborate habits in the end

1374
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,680
but this happens

1375
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,559
not it actually it does not happen

1376
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,480
when you train employees for half an

1377
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,880
hour per year and then let's turn around

1378
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,440
and say oh

1379
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,280
humans are the weakest link see i did

1380
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,280
everything i trained them and it didn't

1381
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,240
pay off yes it didn't pay off because i

1382
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,640
you only offered the message the one the

1383
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,400
message once

1384
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,760
you made them walk this path it was

1385
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,200
effortful it was hard it was not

1386
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,839
pleasant and uh then you left them and

1387
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,760
yet in their own devices instead of

1388
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,359
reinforcing it and working on them

1389
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,079
so as defenders to bypass these

1390
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,000
limitations and to

1391
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,520
create

1392
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,520
an environment where people

1393
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,040
view security as a shared responsibility

1394
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,599
it is a very good idea first of all to

1395
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,240
have clear policies and procedures that

1396
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,240
minimize employee decision making

1397
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,240
wherever possible

1398
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,160
so they are supposed to know

1399
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,400
what their response should be to

1400
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,720
specific requests

1401
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,160
for example

1402
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,119
i at the same time good quality training

1403
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,000
that actively engages employees is a

1404
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,559
must training that is personal training

1405
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,200
that intrigues people training they can

1406
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,280
relate to an interest

1407
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,200
interests them and not just training

1408
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,599
that is out of the box and has one

1409
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,680
relevant message and 15 year relevant

1410
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,160
ones because then it's die and it only

1411
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,599
becomes an irritation it doesn't

1412
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,920
reinforce anything

1413
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,000
having a security mindset within the

1414
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,400
organization and cultivating it it is an

1415
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,440
ongoing process and with it utilizing

1416
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,920
group influence tactics again

1417
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,559
social psychology group influence means

1418
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,640
that if everybody else follows a

1419
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,799
specific habit a specific ritual or rule

1420
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,160
others

1421
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,319
we tend to want to follow it as well

1422
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,319
because we comply with the group

1423
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,599
behaviors

1424
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,400
and that starts from leadership

1425
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,559
but that's another topic

1426
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,960
and last run exercises run attack

1427
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,119
simulations and reinforces good

1428
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,119
practices because when people get

1429
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,400
actively

1430
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,559
data to actively see how attacks look

1431
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,319
like and have to respond

1432
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,480
to them learning becomes easier they

1433
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,760
will remember it and remember

1434
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,000
when we filter

1435
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,880
cognitively what happens perceptually

1436
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,720
experiences past experiences and

1437
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,920
knowledge are two of the main factors

1438
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,440
that help us reach the right conclusion

1439
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,680
in a situation

1440
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,879
so there are some good news

1441
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,920
now we close and this is the last part

1442
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,559
of this presentation with a targeted and

1443
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,680
tailored attacks because

1444
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,839
we will have to deal with more of them

1445
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,599
in the years to come

1446
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,760
the targeted and tailored attacks focus

1447
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,640
on

1448
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,799
focus on some of the universal elements

1449
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,040
of behavior but

1450
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,119
at the core they take advantage of our

1451
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,640
individual

1452
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,960
needs weaknesses goals

1453
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,319
personalities etc

1454
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,559
what are these targeted tailored attacks

1455
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,119
where sometimes they look as long-term

1456
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,280
social engineering attacks in the past

1457
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,160
couple of months we had quite a few

1458
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,880
reports becoming public

1459
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,559
in reality

1460
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,799
there are a lot more cases but finally

1461
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,680
we have some documented

1462
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,920
reports for example facebook came out

1463
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,120
and

1464
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,280
[Music]

1465
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,079
reported a small army of um

1466
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,160
of fake online personas that were aiming

1467
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,319
to contact targets to bait trust and

1468
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,160
click them into clicking on malicious

1469
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,200
links

1470
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,680
this is in their blog and also proof

1471
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,680
point came out with a couple of cases

1472
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,920
one of them was the case of marcella

1473
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,760
flores who was a sock puppet account

1474
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,799
operated by the group ta

1475
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,040
for 56

1476
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,599
and it targeted one person and what was

1477
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,839
very characteristic about this case but

1478
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,240
has happened in other cases as well was

1479
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,920
that martial flores this persona was

1480
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,720
engaging her target for over a year she

1481
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,640
was communicating with him she

1482
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,440
established the report based on

1483
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,559
the

1484
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,400
topics he liked and he enjoyed

1485
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,240
he wanted to talk about but also his

1486
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,359
individual makeup

1487
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,040
targeted and tailored attacks that

1488
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,680
utilize our individual

1489
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,520
uniqueness and

1490
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,480
motives are also employed during insider

1491
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,880
threat recruitment campaigns another

1492
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,839
topic we don't talk enough about

1493
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,160
and in human intelligence and espionage

1494
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,879
operations

1495
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,160
like we said they start by counting on

1496
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,760
specific

1497
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,839
universal needs that all people have

1498
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,400
maslow put it best they are very

1499
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,880
accurate now most of us have covered our

1500
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,760
physiological and safety needs

1501
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,200
but a whole lot of us still have gaps

1502
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,599
when it comes to satisfying our need for

1503
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,680
love and belonging self-esteem and

1504
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,839
self-actualization

1505
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:16,960
so what

1506
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,640
social engineers working on these

1507
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,799
long-term

1508
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,040
campaigns we base their approach on is

1509
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,040
that they will offer the sense of

1510
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,240
belonging

1511
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,599
they will offer appreciation and respect

1512
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,760
and build that person's self-esteem so

1513
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,440
that they can open up to them a little

1514
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,599
bit more and

1515
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,240
they usually don't read

1516
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,160
self-actualization but they use esteem

1517
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,000
and the need for belonging to entice

1518
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,880
they also know some other universal

1519
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,000
motivating factors the fact that we need

1520
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,079
people and we like people who make us

1521
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,200
feel good about ourselves maslow

1522
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,160
we

1523
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,000
want to engage with people with that

1524
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,920
serve some sort of our personal

1525
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,559
interests and that satisfy an unmet need

1526
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,240
and we also generally like to hang

1527
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,960
around people that look and act like us

1528
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,280
because this is our tribe by instinct

1529
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,720
this is where we face safe this is where

1530
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,119
we feel best at with people that are on

1531
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,040
the same wavelength it feels like a

1532
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,480
small or

1533
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,440
asses

1534
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,880
because other than that yeah we don't

1535
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,160
have in life a lot of people that

1536
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,280
that can

1537
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,200
get the same wavelength so it's

1538
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,960
something very precious and something

1539
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,079
that also social engineers try to mirror

1540
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,100
and exploit unfortunately

1541
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,449
[Music]

1542
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,920
so starting from the basis i know from

1543
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,079
what is known about human wiring they

1544
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,839
develop their attacks based on the

1545
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,240
target's self-interests goals and

1546
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,520
desires

1547
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,520
basically what happens is a

1548
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,839
relatively quick profiling i have a

1549
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:57,440
whole other talk on how this profiling

1550
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,599
on specific targets is happening i

1551
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,440
presented it at devcon but i can also

1552
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,200
send you the link or the slides if you

1553
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,839
want to contact me

1554
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,799
basically they identify the person's

1555
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,760
safe interests goals and desires and try

1556
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,319
to serve them or their unmet needs and

1557
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,920
weaknesses

1558
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,520
they try to identify whether there are

1559
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,319
any addictions because bribery and

1560
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,359
blackmail are cybersecurity weapons when

1561
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,440
it comes to humans especially when it

1562
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,520
comes to insider threats

1563
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,599
and then they try to identify again

1564
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,160
through the profiling process

1565
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,400
personality traits

1566
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,680
their strong beliefs their safe identity

1567
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,240
and based on that they bleed report

1568
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,319
safe identity

1569
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,960
is an important factor because

1570
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,280
especially through social psychology now

1571
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,119
we know that people

1572
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,160
um

1573
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,079
are very stubborn about their

1574
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,680
self-identity and they don't want to

1575
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,880
deviate from that so if someone is

1576
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,799
portraying themselves as someone or

1577
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,119
believes that they are helpful and

1578
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,440
supportive towards other or if they are

1579
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,680
they will not want to deviate from that

1580
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,680
if a social engineer identifies

1581
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,280
assignment they will treat it as a

1582
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,200
weakness and they will exploit it

1583
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,799
because they know that if we refuse help

1584
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:16,720
if somebody who believes

1585
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,880
that they are helpful refuses to give

1586
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,200
help they will have to face a lot of

1587
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,640
guilt all of a sudden because it

1588
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,440
deviates from who they believe they are

1589
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,760
and they will perceive it as betraying

1590
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,880
their values in themselves

1591
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,000
the long-term attacks are very sad and

1592
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,400
they are very painful for the victims

1593
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,319
it's a pity that

1594
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,599
we have

1595
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,000
we have to deal with that as well

1596
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,400
unfortunately they are not simply based

1597
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,520
on short-lived influence tactics

1598
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,240
that's because you cannot

1599
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,000
you cannot engage with the target

1600
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,680
through influence tactics for a very

1601
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,359
very long time at some point they figure

1602
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,160
out that something is wrong

1603
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,000
but on the other hand they are based on

1604
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,319
building personal relationships

1605
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,400
and they look

1606
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,680
they somewhat look like the real

1607
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,400
relationships

1608
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,400
and the genuine relationships that we

1609
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,640
form now as they progress more

1610
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,200
information about the individual becomes

1611
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,480
available

1612
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,359
and it becomes utilized and exploited

1613
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,440
and there are additional opportunities

1614
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,920
for bonding tactics which means that the

1615
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,680
more they engage with the target they

1616
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,240
more they are able to groom them into

1617
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,559
the perfect victims

1618
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,799
now as social engineers that are working

1619
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:36,079
on a defensive security we cannot

1620
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,119
um

1621
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,000
run the the tailored long-term social

1622
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,640
engineering attacks as engagements

1623
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,520
it's also hugely unethical

1624
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,599
but what we need to do and what we have

1625
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,520
to do is to learn to read the targets in

1626
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,440
a more specialized way

1627
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,359
to find these potentially exploitable

1628
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,400
vulnerabilities and to help them become

1629
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,799
aware of those and to protect themselves

1630
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,839
and their organizations

1631
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:04,640
we can do on the defense is to teach

1632
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,440
them very clear and

1633
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,880
completely non-negotiable boundaries

1634
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,799
it's a it is a non-negotiable to give

1635
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,440
confidential information or to disclose

1636
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,160
company strategies or or anything that

1637
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,559
happens within the company and this of

1638
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,880
importance it is a non-negotiable to

1639
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,440
provide access it is a non-negotiable to

1640
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,400
open any email through the corporate

1641
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,160
network for example

1642
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,920
to teach them a healthy dose of

1643
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,640
suspicion

1644
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,520
and to to teach them threat awareness

1645
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,319
but also self-awareness and that happens

1646
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,160
through the target vulnerability

1647
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,879
assessments

1648
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,319
yes

1649
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,880
it all sounds a bit pessimistic but it

1650
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,039
is not as much because i believe that we

1651
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,520
can still guard the gates the people we

1652
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,960
work with they can still guard the gates

1653
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,839
um as long as they are equipped with the

1654
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,160
skis and knowledge necessary to do so

1655
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,319
and on the other hand it is also very

1656
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,160
difficult from the side of an

1657
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,400
impersonator to be perfect

1658
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,160
they cannot be perfect at all levels

1659
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,240
they cannot

1660
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,559
be extremely consistent and not raise

1661
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,839
any flags at any point they too will

1662
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,400
make mistakes because they too have to

1663
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,039
battle their own human limits and the

1664
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,640
fact that

1665
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,680
they cannot predict everything

1666
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,760
and as long as we make sure that we

1667
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,760
build a workforce that knows how to

1668
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,599
handle these situations that knows how

1669
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,440
to ask the right questions but also set

1670
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,160
the right boundaries and we truly built

1671
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,000
this capability in there

1672
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,760
i believe we can and i hope we can have

1673
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,039
a more

1674
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,799
optimistic and

1675
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,000
better years ahead as an industry

1676
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,720
now i know that this has been

1677
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,599
quite a lot of information i hope you

1678
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,520
will deep dive a little bit more on some

1679
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,039
aspects of it

1680
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,240
so please

1681
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,599
i ask you to reach out with questions

1682
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:07,520
even through text even through twitter i

1683
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,720
don't mind

1684
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,640
and reach out if you want additional

1685
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,200
resources and if you want me to help you

1686
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,559
out

1687

i will be very happy to

1688
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,160
i will be very happy to answer and to

1689
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,440
