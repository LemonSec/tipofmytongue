00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,320
hi i'm rob curtinseifer director of

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,320

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,279
i'm zlata pavlova i do social media and

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,559
marketing here at dan guardians and also

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,120
assist in various oceans and social

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,760
engineering engagements at inguardians

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
so just a quick disclaimer before we

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,360
start

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,920
this method works for us you may need to

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,680
make some small adjustments or big

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,920
adjustments depending on your situation

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
and your style of work

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,800
uh for me i spent years

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,879
inside of various reconnaissance units

22
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,800
inside the military uh specifically the

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
us army

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,600
and zalata well she's just russian and

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,798
you don't mess with russians

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,159
awesome so an overview here

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,759
of what we're going to talk about first

28
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,520
thing first we're going to

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,400
define what recon is uh from a

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,439
military's perspective uh versus an

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,600
infosec perspective

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,479
and

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,759
it's really important because

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,000
reconnaissance really started with the

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,280
military

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
then we're going to dive into

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
pre-engagement intelligence gathering

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,320
ocean

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,159
as some of you may know

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,520
and then we're going to talk about

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
establishing a pattern of life this is

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,240
the first phase in which we are setting

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,119
foot

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
on client side

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
uh phase three is analysis and planning

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
uh that's where the bulk of the majority

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,280
of the work is going to happen

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,079
phase four is breach

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
phase five is sensitive site

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,040
exploitation and exfiltration

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,000
and then we're going to have a

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
conclusion

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,080
so the first thing we want to define is

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
the military

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,840
definition of reconnaissance

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,440
very basic

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,400
it is at the observation of a region

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
to locate an enemy or to ascertain

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,920
strategic features for example

60
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
do these insurgents here have air

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,440
defense capabilities so we send the

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
reconnaissance team in the ground

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,840
observe them do they have air defense

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,120
capabilities yes or no

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
do we they have

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
this very specific style of fighting or

67
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
you know what what is their pattern

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
where do they move where do they come

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,280
from where do they hide

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
it's a very

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,519
very

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,239
narrow view

73
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,400
and

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
when it comes to

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,120
reconnaissance and the infosec world

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,879
it's uh

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,640
basically everything that you can

78
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,480
collect on a specific target um online

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,200
uh when we talk about reconnaissance

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
specifically for

81
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,480
the physical engagement physical

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,040
penetration tests um

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
reconnaissance

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
phase also includes um establishing the

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,560
pattern of life uh getting familiar with

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,239
the target location uh so similar to the

87
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,599
military uh definition of reconnaissance

88
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,519
the main goal of

89
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,480
any reconnaissance is to be is to

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,959
correctly uh

91
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,239
is to covertly collect all of the data

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,200
on

93
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,080
the target you want to make sure that

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,879
the client has no idea that you even

95
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,760
gathering um all of that awesome

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,798
information on them

97
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
so

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,720
phase one

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
intel gathering ocean

100
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,920
um this is one of the most important

101
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,159
phases uh

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,400
when you're preparing for a physical

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,319
penetration engagement

104
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,639
and ocean is really your best friend for

105
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,040
um any engagement including social

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,199
engineering engagements as well

107
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,080
uh why ocean matters uh it matters

108
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,360
because

109
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,880
you wanna get familiar with the

110
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,600
target the client um you wanna get

111
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,280
familiar with uh the company culture you

112
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
wanna find out who the employees are

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
yeah you wanna see where uh the targets

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,840
um like uh location you want to get

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,240
familiar with uh surroundings of that

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
location you really want to have a whole

117
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,160
picture of what you're going to be

118
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,560
working with on your uh

119
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,680
physical engagement uh there are various

120
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,479
resources available where you can

121
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,560
collect all of that data

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
and it's all gonna depend on your goals

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,000
and objectives it's also gonna depend on

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
type of industry that your client or

125
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,960
your target is in

126
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,759
because certain industries have

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,320
less of the let's say social media

128
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
presence or an online presence therefore

129
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,400
collecting the intel sometimes is kind

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,000
of uh tricky it's a little bit harder

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
versus you know let's say like a major

132
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,600
retailers that are constantly

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,560
online on various platforms and it makes

134
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,080
it a lot easier

135
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,880
to

136
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,199
collect information same goes to

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,080
employees because certain

138
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
government organizations or government

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
defense organizations

140
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,120
they have specific policies of not

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,919
having employees let's say on linkedin

142
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,960
so have to take all of that um

143
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,800
into the consideration

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,120
also with any um ocean investigation

145
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,240
you have to check multiple sources

146
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,199
going on one side and you know

147
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,360
copy pasting something from there it's

148
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
uh it's not enough

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
you need to verify your uh

150
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,120
data

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
always because

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,039
things are changing what was on one side

153
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,759
yesterday is no longer there today

154
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,280
so

155
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,639
verify

156
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,600
all of your data and take lots of notes

157
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,639
while you

158
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,120
uh going through the process of

159
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,800
data collection

160
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,880
intel gathering because again

161
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,479
oftentimes

162
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,440
sites gets taken down or

163
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,639
users deleting their accounts or

164
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,560
whatever it might be so taking

165
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
screenshots taking notes to make sure

166
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,880
that you can include that in the report

167
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,599
you can show the client how did you get

168
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,199
from the point a to point b uh in your

169
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,400
reconnaissance phase is really really um

170
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,919
important

171
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,520
again i

172
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,560
don't

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,800
underestimate the power of

174
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,840
manual

175
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,199
search

176
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
we all know that when it comes to osen

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
there are thousands of different tools

178
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,240
available they all do different things

179
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,199
some of them are amazing

180
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,000
but some of them are not particularly

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,280
useful when you're collecting

182
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,000
data collecting ocean for

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,960
physical penetration testing therefore

184
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,479
manual search

185
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,039
although time consuming but it is

186
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,560
important step in every preparation for

187
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,199
the engagement because

188
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,360
you need to look at pictures uh you need

189
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,160
to

190
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,039
find i don't know badge pictures or

191
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,520
workstation setups and unfortunately

192
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
tools can't really

193
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,240
make that happen for you

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
and divide responsibilities divide

195
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,720
responsibilities with your

196
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,199
partner if you're on the team

197
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,440
with your teammates because first it's

198
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
going to save you a lot of time second

199
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
of all everyone's thought process is

200
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,319
different so

201
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,840
you can really

202
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,720
um you can really find a lot of value

203
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,599
and

204
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,319
others ways of you know thinking and

205
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
searching and together you can

206
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,120
really put a valuable data in your

207
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
pre-engagement

208
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,399
absolutely

209
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,039
the the first thing uh the

210
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,958
pre-engagement intel gathering

211
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,600
uh i want to talk about it is

212
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,399
just

213
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,320
print a map right that if you could

214
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
print a map of your target you could

215
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
identify the target's location in

216
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,519
surrounding areas

217
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,959
right um

218
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,360
it's important because you're able to

219
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
see the

220
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
train features uh can i approach from

221
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,120
the back is it heavily wooded

222
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,519
is there a creek

223
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,640
blocking

224
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,680
this ingress point is there fences

225
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,560
um

226
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,160
what are some of the surrounding

227
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
businesses right that's also very

228
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
important um

229
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,040
and also you get a look through uh is

230
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,080
there any doors uh where the doors are

231
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,959
uh is there gates is there guard shacks

232
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,080
is there

233
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,160
um large windows

234
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,040
um

235
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
if you get a really good map such from

236
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,720
uh google earth

237
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,920
um or google maps you could zoom in and

238
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,360
and try to pinpoint where the cctvs are

239
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,959
using street view

240
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,080
um

241
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,640
you also get the ability to find

242
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,760
visible physical security controls

243
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
do they have rfid badge readers next to

244
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,279
the doors

245
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,240
um

246
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,720
are they push doors are they pull doors

247
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
are they just regular knob doors

248
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
right all this is stuff that you could

249
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,320
do pre-engagement intel gathering so

250
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
that you have a better

251
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,519
assessment

252
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,920
an idea of

253
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,079
what the client has once you get on site

254
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
yep uh also something to um to add to

255
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,640
that uh when you're looking for

256
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,240
when you're looking at maps whether it's

257
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,079
google maps or

258
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,920
bing maps or whatever

259
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,120
um

260
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
the reason why you want to look at

261
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,519
various resources is because every

262
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,640
single

263
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,839
map has a different time frame on

264
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,000
when that specific street view or

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
pictures were taken

266
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,079
oftentimes you can see how certain

267
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,079
terrain certain area looks like in

268
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,959
various times of years

269
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,680
and you can do that with google earth

270
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,600
app if you have that installed you can

271
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
go back and

272
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
access the archives and see how a

273
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
certain area looked like you know a year

274
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
ago or in the summer or whatever if they

275
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
have that data

276
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
available you can also often see uh

277
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
delivery trucks or third-party services

278
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,760
pulling in into that location so that

279
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
will give you an extra piece of intel

280
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,320
uh maybe this is the company that they

281
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,560
are contracting with

282
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,959
or whatever else might be so

283
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,160
always

284
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,720
important to check

285
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,320
multiple sources when it comes to

286
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,200
maps and really like walk in that street

287
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,360
view get familiar with all of the

288
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,519
surrounding areas because you're going

289
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,720
to need that

290
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,839
on one of the engagements that we

291
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,600
rob and i went

292
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,279
we identified a bunch of access points

293
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,160
we identified surrounding areas with the

294
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,959
fences and everything else so that give

295
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
gave us um a good idea of how we can

296
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,440
approach and

297
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,519
where can we start

298
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,959
our you know

299
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,160
descending so to say to um a physical

300
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,240
location for our uh target

301
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,880
so use multiple yeah

302
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,360
if we would have used multiple views

303
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
on that engagement

304
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,920
uh and looked back over time we wouldn't

305
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,399
have to have to wait through that swamp

306
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,120
and creek because in the image it looked

307
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,800
like the creek was

308
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,680
you know

309
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,360
a literal small couple inches deep creek

310
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,279
but once we got there

311
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,040
and it started raining uh

312
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,680
um that is pretty deep and it would have

313
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
saved us you know having to go buy new

314
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,839
clothes and waterproof clothes just to

315
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,920
try to get across that so

316
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,800
uh that's really important to do and to

317
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
look historically over it and forecast

318
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,160
weather

319
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,560
yep absolutely always check the weather

320
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,519
always plan for any weather changes

321
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,920
uh when you're going in unfamiliar

322
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,160
territory so to say

323
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,720
you might also want to look at various

324
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
uh company filings

325
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,200
or government records

326
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
and the reason behind it is that

327
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
sometimes in those filings they use

328
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,920
specific corporate language

329
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,200
that is specific to a particular

330
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,160
organization so some organizations refer

331
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,519
to their employees as associates maybe

332
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,680
or team members so if you're coming up

333
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,760
with the pretext

334
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
you want to make sure that it matches

335
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,680
the corporate

336
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,000
lingual you can also see sometimes um

337
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,920
other uh like key people that are in

338
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,279
that specific organization and also

339
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,600
sometimes see like the copy of their

340
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
signature or at least the signature that

341
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,839
they use to sign

342
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,000
certain corporate papers again you can

343
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,480
also use that in your

344
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,839
pretext

345
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,880
um

346
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,160
also never

347
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,320
underestimate the power of not so

348
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,440
popular um resources to look at uh

349
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,480
some

350
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,360
location data and that could be yelp if

351
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
you are going to like a retail or like a

352
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,839
small shop

353
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,399
because oftentimes yelp would contain

354
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,360
photos of interior exterior and

355
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,519
sometimes people just uh not really

356
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,279
paying attention to what they are

357
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,519
floating and not thinking about the

358
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,760
risks but it's good

359
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,199
for us as

360
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,920
physical pen testers because we can go

361
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
on those websites and

362
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:34,959
have

363
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,000
literally um a good

364
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,240
picture of how

365
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
the property looks inside without even

366
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
being there

367
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
and one of the engagements rob and i

368
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,800
were working on

369
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,199
i found out um

370
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,040
i found a

371
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
news piece from like the local news

372
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
company

373
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,399
that recorded

374
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,680
pretty much

375
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,959
everything

376
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,680
on the targets location like the inside

377
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,279
every office every hall everything so

378
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,079
without us even being there we already

379
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,560
knew where to go and how the building is

380
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,240
going to look like

381
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,800
on the inside so multiple sources always

382
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,760
some

383
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,480
not so popular ones like youtube yelp

384
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,240
can really um

385
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,519
help you find the specific

386
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,279
information on the target that you're

387
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
looking for

388
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,199
um another thing that we

389
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,480
also always check is various job

390
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,759
postings

391
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,720
and the reason behind it is uh

392
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
besides of course you know the company

393
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,240
culture and kind of like the inside look

394
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,120
into

395
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,920
technology they use you can also find

396
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,680
out the schedule

397
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,399
or the shift changes and it's important

398
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,480
for us because when we go on the

399
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,639
physical uh

400
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,839
physical engagement we want to know

401
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,800
when

402
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,279
certain departments are in the office

403
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,560
when people come to work when they leave

404
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,440
whether uh the specific business have

405
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,399
any guards are those guards armed so you

406
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,199
want to be prepared as much as you can

407
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,120
also pay attention to uh reviews from

408
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,519
unhappy employees because they would

409
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,800
often

410
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,079
name drop

411
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,639
you know managers or other co-workers

412
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,839
that they were

413
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,040
upset with

414
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,839
and that will give you a lot of

415
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,120
good intel that you can use in your

416
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,480
pretext

417
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,519
or

418
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,240
already on the spot during your physical

419
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,800
engagement

420
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,279
a good example of that is during one of

421
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
our engagements we found that one of the

422
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,959
employees there

423
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,920
was complain that they brought dogs in

424
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,519
right and we're thinking

425
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
right are they guard dogs are they drug

426
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,839
sniffing dogs and we reached out to the

427
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,599
point of contact and

428
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,919
it turns out it was uh bed bug sniffing

429
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,720
dogs uh but it brought up a valid point

430
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,640
we had a concern hey you know we're not

431
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,160
gonna do a physical if there's guard

432
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
dogs we want to have noticed that if it

433
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,199
wasn't for

434
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,520
digging through some of these reviews

435
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,079
um from from employees

436
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,679
and so that i just want to underline

437
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,079
that a little bit but

438
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,080
yep sorry um

439
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,000
and um also with um a lot of other

440
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,120
resources like you know linkedin company

441
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,640
page or

442
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,520
facebook company pages oftentimes

443
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,400
employees would comment uh they would

444
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,640
over share without even thinking that

445
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
they saying something that or sharing a

446
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
certain information that should not be

447
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,320
shared um so pay attention to those

448
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,440
comments really like look through to try

449
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
and find um as much information as

450
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,919
possible

451
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,919
again an example of one of our

452
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,080
engagements uh we found um a business uh

453
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,400
facebook page however uh it was made by

454
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,799
like a few of um

455
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,200
a few of the workers from that specific

456
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,280
location it wasn't like an actual

457
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,919
authorized uh social media page by the

458
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,120
business

459
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
um and that happens a lot because not

460
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,480
every company has like a good uh social

461
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
media policy in place

462
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,760
uh explaining if someone can create a

463
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,600
business page or not

464
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,559
um

465
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,280
so

466
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,160
we found this page and since it was

467
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,559
uh ran by the employees only employees

468
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,919
shared a lot a lot of information about

469
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,200
like an internal you know hiring process

470
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,280
they shared their emails uh direct lines

471
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,080
with extensions so we really hit the

472
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,840
gold mine with uh that facebook business

473
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,960
page and we collected a lot of our intel

474
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,919
from that and we used a lot of it uh

475
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,200
during our pretext when we were on site

476
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,919
again it almost felt like you actually

477
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
knew everyone when you're walking into

478
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,880
that building because you saw them

479
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
on facebook and they really did

480
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,000
uh

481
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
share a lot

482
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,760
when it comes to badges um our go-to are

483
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
usually um instagram

484
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
sometimes facebook

485
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,080
but instagram

486
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,200
has

487
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,480
the geolocation search feature

488
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,760
and if you know your target address

489
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
you can type that in and see if anyone

490
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
is posting pictures in that specific

491
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,039
location and you can find

492
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
a lot of good

493
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,600
badges good pictures of badges

494
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,320
workstation setups and things like that

495
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,720
again you can find out who the employees

496
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,520
are you can even match them later on on

497
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,840
linkedin or

498
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,400
i don't know facebook whatever your

499
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
goals and objectives are for that

500
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,080
specific um

501
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,440
engagement

502
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,480
again

503
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,679
youtube

504
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,360
lots of videos

505
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,559
i will have an example in the next

506
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,760
couple of slides um check everything

507
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,919
that you possibly can when you're

508
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,120
getting ready for um

509
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,360
the physical engagement do you have

510
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,159
anything to add to that rob

511
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,559
nope i think he covered it all

512
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,039
awesome

513
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,919
so um here i have just uh an example of

514
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,120
a simple

515
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,240
ocean

516
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,120
uh

517
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
mind map so to say

518
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
um

519
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,760
it helps you to uh

520
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,640
filter and narrow down uh all of the

521
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,039
various resources that you need to look

522
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,760
at

523
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,200
uh before

524
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,799
starting your

525
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,039
phase one reconnaissance digital

526
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,400
reconnaissance

527
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
um

528
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,159
the map is gonna differ by you know the

529
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,120
industry again if your client work uh if

530
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
your client is in like really super

531
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,240
secret industry of course maybe they're

532
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,559
not going to have an extensive

533
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,200
social media presence or they're not

534
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,799
going to list their employees on the

535
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,480
website

536
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,000
however for

537
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,640
the major

538
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
for the major clients uh

539
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,320
this applies

540
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,039
uh and that can again you can make it in

541
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,280
any way possible but it kind of helps

542
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,960
you narrow down um all of the

543
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,159
areas of search um all of the possible

544
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,320
results maybe that you can

545
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,039
come across and there are

546
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,840
a lot of them are available online that

547
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
you can use kind of like a mind map when

548
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,960
you first starting out uh and then as

549
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,000
you start to um

550
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
do more and more of those physical

551
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,280
engagements or social engineering

552
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,400
engagements um you can create your own

553
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,440
and find out uh what resources

554
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,880
works best

555
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,200
for you

556
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,159
on

557
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,559
you know of course mine is my favorite

558
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,360
is the social media because i think i

559
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,360
find most information

560
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,720
on people's profiles um

561
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,919
that are like that like to over share

562
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,960
um

563
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,840
that

564
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,520
business facebook page that i talked

565
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,039
about earlier one of the employees um

566
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,360
also checked in on facebook to that

567
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,480
business

568
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,240
and posted her badge that we copied and

569
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,880
then we used uh on our

570
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,480
physical

571
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,320
engagement and

572
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
she also posted

573
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
another picture and her profile is set

574
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,440
to public so anyone can see

575
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,720
everything

576
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,760
and she also posted a picture of how

577
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,240
the inside of one of the work areas

578
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,360
looked like

579
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,240
with the table that contained a bunch of

580
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,200
folders and that's how we were able to

581
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,400
find out who their payroll company is

582
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
security company is

583
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,600
and

584
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,480
another folder even contained password

585
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,200
so later on when we were actually on the

586
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
physical engagement we went there and

587
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,640
the folders are still on that

588
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,600
table

589
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,960
so

590
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,080
never yeah underestimate the power of

591
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,879
social media searches

592
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,280
and uh

593
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
here are just some examples

594
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,840
that i found on

595
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
google

596
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,679
the first image here with the blueprints

597
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,720
um this is actually from the government

598
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
defense building

599
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,159
locally here in

600
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,120
california and i believe the picture was

601
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,159
uploaded by the person who

602
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,400
did the remodeling work

603
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,039
because that business does not have any

604
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,400
other

605
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,880
reviews or checkings because it's not

606
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,200
the building where civilians check in

607
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,440
often so to say but

608
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,080
here we are with the blueprints

609
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,679
um

610
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,880
i also have the screenshot of the

611
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
call center it's a video on youtube and

612
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,600
the call center employee decided to

613
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
share her work day

614
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,799
with the world

615
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,039
including the sensitive patient info

616
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,279
that i redacted on the screen

617
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,720
um

618
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,039
also multiple workstations multiple

619
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,240
employees the company that she works for

620
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,400
the call center that she works for so a

621
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,440
lot of

622
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,919
a lot of this data is out there and you

623
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,840
don't really need to like dig deep to

624
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,000
find it it's literally just like on the

625
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,200
surface

626
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,400
um

627
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
google reviews for

628
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,440
business pages are often useful because

629
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,400
you can find specific names

630
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,279
specific people who works there like

631
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,600
distribute if you're picking up or

632
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,440
dropping off you know you need to talk

633
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,200
to so and so

634
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,919
so

635
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,840
again manual search

636
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,480
is super beneficial with your um oscent

637
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,000
process and

638
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,360
collect collect a list of names

639
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,960
and

640
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
and try to

641
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,080
to draw them out

642
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,120
um due to the fact that uh you know i

643
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
was doing a physical once

644
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,640
um and as we were breaching the building

645
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
uh we weren't able to see the other side

646
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,720
which contained the janitor um the

647
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,279
janitor was startled and who were you

648
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,840
uh

649
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,360
oh bob sent us uh to work on the it

650
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,400
problems that we're having these

651
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,799
computers over i'm rob at i.t this is

652
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,960

653
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,080

so-and-so sent you okay cool right and

655
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,919
then later on during the engagement we

656
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,760
we um

657
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,279
we we met him again when we were trying

658
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,760
to hit another one of our objectives

659
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,520
and uh he's like oh you guys startled me

660
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,960
again i forgot you were here and we're

661
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,320
like hey man can you let us in our keys

662
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,000

663
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,360
and we were trying to get in and he was

664
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,880
like yeah no problem

665
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,279
and just let us in for our objective so

666
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,520
having that list of names

667
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,159
and knowing when to use them and

668
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,480
gathering them is very very important

669
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,600
yep

670
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,000
all right establishing a pattern of life

671
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
all right so why do we want to establish

672
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,480
a pattern of life this is the first part

673
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,159
of the engagement when you're setting

674
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,480
foot on well one we want to validate

675
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,559
that the oh cent we have collected is

676
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,760
accurate

677
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,320
99 of the time it will be it'll be

678
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,919
accurate but we just want to validate

679
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,840
right we want to validate the maps we

680
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,320
want to validate the terrain we want to

681
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,000
validate the shift changes we want to

682
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,799
validate everything

683
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,240
you know we just want to make sure that

684
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,559
we have the most accurate

685
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,200
and up-to-date intelligence as possible

686
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,360
right and while we're doing that we're

687
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,880
also going to start developing our

688
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,200
initial attack path

689
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,000
and

690
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,679
you know well

691
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,840
we see this door there doesn't seem a

692
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,000
lot of cameras here just got maybe some

693
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,159
good egress points

694
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,000
and we'll start developing and having

695
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,840
that thought process

696
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,279
we also want to get familiar with

697
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,480
surrounding areas in real life

698
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,799
when is the other businesses surrounding

699
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,520
their when are there hours of operation

700
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,600
right when do they have people coming

701
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,960
when they go

702
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,640
uh the last thing you want to do is be

703
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,159
caught by an employee of another company

704
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,679
while trying to breach

705
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,200
your actual

706
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,360
contracted target

707
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,279
right um so the best way to do that is

708
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,600
just get familiar with the areas

709
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,279
find out where employees like to go to

710
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,200
eat all right

711
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,039
um this

712
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
you know where's the restaurants where's

713
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,799
the gas stations where's the police

714
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,600
station uh surrounding areas like

715
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,159
where's the nearest residential area

716
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,840
you really just really want to start

717
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,679
working all that around

718
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,320
because and visual representation is the

719
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,240
best so

720
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,320
when we go on site we print off a bunch

721
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,159
of maps and we start jotting notes down

722
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,679
on the maps right

723
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,640
um

724
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,799
for example when we're starting to do

725
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,640
shift changes when we drive by a parking

726
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,039
lot in the beginning of the day uh we

727
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,120
usually jot down two or three cars that

728
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,559
stand out to us hey a lime green jeep

729
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,960
um and there's a corvette parked over

730
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
here that's a lot of cars kind of stand

731
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,720
out a little bit right uh there's a

732
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,440
lifted truck over here and we'll drive

733
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,320
by

734
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
periodically and try to find out when

735
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,559
those cars are no longer there

736
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,840
um

737
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
right so what does that do well that

738
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,520
lets you know when employees are coming

739
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
and going

740
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
um

741
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,960
right we also want to go in after hours

742
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,080
and watch the the security guards work

743
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,240
um when do they do their rounds to do

744
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,120
the rounds on it on a very

745
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,240
you know

746
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,399
by the book mentality like every 20

747
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,600
minutes i'm gonna walk around this

748
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,799
building every half an hour i'm gonna

749
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,880
walk around this building do they walk

750
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,600
around the building or do they have uh

751
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,520
the pole that they tapped to the magnets

752
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,360
to signify that they were there

753
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,080
right it's very important to

754
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,720
establish how the security is is being

755
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,440
done do they even have 24-hour security

756
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,360
do they even do patrols these are all

757
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,880
questions you should know before you

758
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,279
even attempt to breach

759
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,360
um another crucial

760
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,320
um

761
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
important thing to find out when we're

762
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,080
establishing a pattern of life is where

763
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,840
do the employees hang out where is the

764
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,000
smoke area how do the

765
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,880
employees get from the parking lot to

766
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,799
uh the place of employment how do they

767
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,559
leave the place of employment to go back

768
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,799
to the cars right do they have to go in

769
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,640
through funneling through a desk uh

770
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,480
through a reception area

771
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,200
right to get in or can they use multiple

772
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,159
doors

773
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,880
um when they leave do they do they go

774
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
hang out in the smoking area catch up

775
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,480
and then leave

776
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,120
these are very very important things to

777
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,919
know

778
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,480
uh you also want to conduct training

779
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,399
terrain analysis right

780
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,080
um

781
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,679
while we were on site uh we identified a

782
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,399
fence line um but what we didn't realize

783
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,559
that earlier before we arrived that

784
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,240
someone drove a car through the fence

785
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,559
and there was a giant hole in the fence

786
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,240
uh and next to the client that separated

787
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,840
the client site from a mobile home park

788
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,080
so we could park in the mobile home

789
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,240
area walk through this gaping hole in

790
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,960
the fence and skirt up the fence line

791
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,440
um and observe in relative darkness and

792
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,720
obscurity

793
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,000
um

794
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,919
the other thing you want to look at is

795
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,880
get

796
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,679
look at their cctvs right if you can

797
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,240
take a picture of their cctvs

798
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,480
and ma map on a point where they're

799
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,120
located uh if you should have

800
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
um

801
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,080
you know your map that you printed out

802
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,960
we keep talking about the map um you can

803
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,399
look up the model number if you get a

804
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,159
good picture of it find their angle of

805
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,039
view

806
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,360
um and actually draw that out on the map

807
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,559
so you could actually see and visualize

808
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,679
um

809
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,559
the

810
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,679
angle that the cameras record uh another

811
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,559
thing is lights right we all know that

812
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,960
sometimes lighting is an issue in the

813
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,880
parking lot so you could actually map

814
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,480
out where the lighting

815
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,399
ends and where it starts so you could

816
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,200
stay on the edge of that lighting

817
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,240
um

818
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
and one of the most important parts here

819
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,440
is communication and notes and actually

820
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,679
drawing it on a map

821
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,840
you know have one partner if you're

822
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,480
driving around and collecting uh have

823
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,640
one person that's you know dedicated

824
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,120
taking consistent notes

825
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,799
uh you can never have too much

826
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,919
information

827
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,039
um and you know by taking consistent

828
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,879
notes you will have a full picture

829
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,960
and also to uh to add to that for the

830
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,320
note taking make sure you take notes and

831
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,120
then you start populating it somewhere

832
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,679
like in the word doc or whatever uh

833
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,159
preparing for your report because

834
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,320
putting it till the last moment thinking

835
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,159
that you're gonna remember it all it's

836
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,159
not gonna happen like that so make sure

837
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,000
you take notes and then you save it

838
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,399
somewhere it would be ready to go to

839
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,039
your clients report

840
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,640
correct

841
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,080
um tools for establishing pattern lab uh

842
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,559
pattern of life i've said it once said

843
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,039
i'll probably say it a billion times one

844
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,600
of the best tools is printing off a map

845
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,880
uh this is an example of a map pouch

846
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,399
that i carry actually i think it's the

847
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,519
exact map pouch i carry um where i can

848
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,919
actually print off the map slide it in

849
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,559
and annotate the map as we go to fill it

850
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,000
in um

851
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,200
another important piece is a dlsr camera

852
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,039
with decent zoom and the ability to take

853
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,440
good shots and poor lighting that allows

854
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,600
you to have that standoff

855
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,919
from your target while still being able

856
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,799
to get those details zoom in on those

857
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,000
doors

858
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,159
um zoom in on those

859
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,679
uh cctvs right zoom in on those rfid

860
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,360
badges and sometimes when you take

861
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,600
pictures of those entrances

862
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,720
you can see stuff for example

863
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,120
we had a clear shot to one of these

864
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,840
doors but we realized that the door on

865
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,519
the other side of the door was an alarm

866
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,039
panel

867
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,440
we realized that by taking a long

868
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,000
distance the lsr shot with good lens so

869
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,399
we knew right then and there that hey

870
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,279
it's alarmed this is the alarm panel and

871
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,080
if we watch and record the first person

872
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,880
in maybe we could get the alarm code uh

873
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,000
so that it doesn't actually go off um

874
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and this is very important you should

875
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,760
never bring your breach kit until it's

876
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,440
time to breach so you don't bring your

877
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,039
full breach kit at this point um

878
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,080
one it's cumbersome too i mean you kind

879
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,360
of look suspicious if you have a

880
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,320
backpack full of underdoor tools and you

881
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,040
know we can data intercept tools and

882
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
you know lock picks and

883
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,119
et cetera et cetera so at this point in

884
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,639
time you do not want to have your full

885
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,839
kit with you

886
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,159
good next slide

887
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,440
awesome

888
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,599
uh analysis and planning this is the

889
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,599
most important phase

890
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,199
uh to us right um so with this one we

891
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,119
always remember the five ps prior

892
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,918
planning prevents poor performance

893
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,839
right um

894
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,599
you should at this point in time you

895
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,960
should you should have enough

896
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,639
information to sit down

897
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,760
and have multiple ingress points plotted

898
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,960
and planned

899
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,800
right you should have multiple breach

900
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
points identified

901
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
you should know where all the doors are

902
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,079
the flow of the people the shift changes

903
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,920
the security patterns for the security

904
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,720
patrols if they have any um so this is

905
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,359
really a good time to sit down and have

906
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,880
these breach points identified right um

907
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,920
you should also have a breach time uh an

908
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,359
established time

909
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,680
frame for each breach right

910
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,880
for us if you roll up onto a door you

911
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,760
should

912
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,280
already know hey when we get to the

913
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,920
store it should take me no more than 90

914
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,240
seconds to get in here it takes me more

915
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
than 90 seconds i think we need to roll

916
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,640
onto another door right whatever your

917
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,359
time frame is you should you should

918
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,480
know it and stick to it um and identify

919
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,560
that out right through your intelligence

920
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,440
and and your recon that you should do

921
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
um

922
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,599
you should have exit strategies uh for

923
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,760
how to get out of the building if

924
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,520
you guys are going to get separated once

925
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,240
you're inside if you have multiple

926
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,880
you know objectives but uh you should

927
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
always have a good clear

928
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,960
exit strategy and you should know where

929
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,240
you're going to rendezvous with your

930
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,800
partner because you will get separated

931
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,040
and you should have we will be here no

932
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,839
later than at this location

933
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:08,960
um

934
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,079
that's that's very important for us um a

935
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,160
communication plan with your partner

936
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,880
your project management and the client

937
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,880
pro point of contact is crucial um it's

938
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
not uncommon for people to have earbuds

939
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,440
in their ears 24 7 365 nowadays so i

940
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,880
just have

941
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,440
earpods in your ear one ear so you could

942
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,119
hear have the other one put away and you

943
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,359
can swap the batteries one in while it's

944
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,280
charging and you can have that and be on

945
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,359
the phone with your partner

946
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,000
you don't have to say anything

947
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,359
but just having an open-minded

948
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,200
communication is important

949
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,000
we like to have a bug out word it's a

950
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,920
word that you will not normally use in a

951
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,599
course of conversation

952
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,280
and that allows your partner if they

953
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,400
hear it um to be okay

954
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,960
i gotta i gotta peel out of here and go

955
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,000
to rendezvous point or if you have one

956
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,160
of your partners is looking as a lookout

957
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,000
and the other person is down doing the

958
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,040
preach um if they say this word it

959
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,560
allows the person on the ground to know

960
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,680
hey stop what i'm doing and let's peel

961
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,720
right

962
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,920
also

963
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,200
equipment checks uh learning a new piece

964
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,440
of equipment should not be done when

965
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,839
you're trying to breach a client right

966
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,680
finding out that your equipment is

967
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,720
broken

968
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,400
that you need to hit this objective

969
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,880
should not be done on

970
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,480
all right when you're trying to breach

971
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,880
the client you should have all make sure

972
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,119
all your equipment is functional

973
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,800
and know that you know how to use each

974
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,680
piece of equipment before you arrive on

975
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,240
site to conduct a breach

976
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,560
thanks remember uh one of them that's

977
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
not on here is always have multiple

978
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,680
plans

979
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,040
in place

980
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,520
for us we like to have three to four

981
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,440
different ingress points plotted out

982
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,560
because

983
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,320
everybody knows that the first plan

984
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,960
doesn't survive initial contact

985
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,599
also have three to four uh different

986
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,160
bridge points identified just in case

987
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,400
you need to peel or you can't breach

988
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,359
your initial door you have alternatives

989
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,480
um

990
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,560
always plan for the what ifs

991
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,640
sit down with your partner

992
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
and i think this is one of the most

993
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,920
important parts

994
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
go through the what ifs

995
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,839
right what if we get stopped by an

996
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,599
employee what do we do

997
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,960
what if we get stopped by law

998
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,920
enforcement how do we act what do we do

999
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,000
what if we get stopped by security what

1000
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,320
if the alarm gets tripped uh recently we

1001
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
were talking to other employees and

1002
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,680
somebody asked me well rob what is

1003
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,640
you know

1004
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,880
the farthest what if

1005
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,800
all right you should plan for

1006
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,760
just under alien invasion is what i told

1007
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,440
them uh

1008
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,040
right um

1009
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,520
just because you know we have these

1010
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,359
far-fetched well what if

1011
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,040
you know you get stopped by law

1012
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,200
enforcement or or something along those

1013
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,880
lines well we had a real life

1014
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,960
environment where uh we were trying to

1015
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,000
breach a a client and there was a very

1016
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,680
important political event happening in

1017
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,000
the same town at the same time

1018
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,160
so stopping and saying what happens if

1019
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,400
we get stopped by the secret service may

1020
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,960
seem a little farfetched to people but

1021
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,720
in reality uh was the possibility there

1022
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,440
um or the fbi or something along those

1023
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,240
lines so you know always plan for the

1024
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,440
what ifs

1025
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,599
um rehearsals

1026
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,560
is also important we're not talking you

1027
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,359
know military style like here's a stick

1028
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,599
house there's a replica this is breach

1029
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,200
mental rehearsals what we're talking

1030
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,079
about

1031
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,800
just talk through these objectives talk

1032
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,320
through the what ifs

1033
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,359
um

1034
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,720
for example hey um we we we we're

1035
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,119
hitting breach point alpha you know i

1036
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,119
can't get in what do we do okay we roll

1037
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,400
the breach point bravo right um and

1038
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,560
where was breach point bravo well it's

1039
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,040
this door right here okay how long do we

1040
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,760
have on target right blam okay we breach

1041
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,440
in here but now we're stopped by

1042
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,200
security what do we do

1043
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,960
and just talk through that until it all

1044
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,640
becomes second nature

1045
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,800
right um

1046
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,599
and most importantly stick to the plan

1047
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,520
right you have a plan for a reason we

1048
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,599
understand plans are flexible uh you

1049
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,760
need to have flexible plans while doing

1050
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,000
this and you can't be super rigid but

1051
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
that's why you have multiple plans

1052
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,040
that's why you have the what-if

1053
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,400
scenarios so you can branch down these

1054
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,680
paths

1055
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,160
as you hit these objectives or to get

1056
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,440
these objectives as you're hitting these

1057
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,800
obstacles uh but still stay on track uh

1058
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,880
to the plan um

1059
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
one of the most important things that i

1060
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,839
think i took away was uh you know after

1061
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,839
action we were doing a physical and we

1062
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,079
had to sit down with the client

1063
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:50,960
um

1064
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,280
and we're sitting down there and

1065
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,880
there we wanted to talk about the

1066
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,599
planning and the analysis and this

1067
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,440
they're like but we want to talk about

1068
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,040
you know the actual breach but we're

1069
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,560
like but we really think you should hear

1070
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,760
about this

1071
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,520
and once we presented them with the sure

1072
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,720
amounts of data that we provided them

1073
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,760
they were just 100

1074
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,520
taken aback like

1075
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,480
wow

1076
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,040
we didn't realize that that our opsec

1077
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,119
was so bad that you know

1078
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,640
that you could get the badge from the

1079
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
internet that you could just sit in the

1080
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,839
tree line

1081
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,640
and get this and watch this and

1082
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
you know uh that you even knew the

1083
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,079
layout of our building by watching

1084
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,720
youtube videos they were just blown away

1085
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,480
that by the time i got to the actual

1086
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,520
breach

1087
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,800
um

1088
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,119
you know they were they were impressed

1089
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,440
by that but they were more bothered by

1090
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,079
the amount of data we presented with

1091
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,440
them that was leaking from their

1092
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,520
environment that they didn't even think

1093
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,400
about

1094
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,440
um so this is why i say analysis and

1095
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,560
planning is the most important phase

1096
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,160
yep i agree i also wanted to add um a

1097
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,640
little bit on the equipment checks

1098
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,119
my funny story of me

1099
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,920
first time ever using the glasses with

1100
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,160
the cameras on and

1101
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,079
i nod a lot when i talk to someone

1102
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:12,880
so

1103
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,119
when i was on site i was talking to uh

1104
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,319
this person

1105
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,040
and uh i kept nodding and you know in

1106
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,560
the conversation we actually had pretty

1107
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,040
long conversation i was there a while

1108
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,079
and

1109
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,960
i was nodding a lot and then when we

1110
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,920
came back and we watched the footage um

1111
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,319
like one of the most important things

1112
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,880
because i was actually standing behind

1113
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,280
her and like looking at her screen to

1114
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,560
see like

1115
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,400
what she was using you know what type of

1116
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,200
like email client and things like that

1117
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,160
and

1118
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,400
you know a lot of things were a blur

1119
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
really because everything was just

1120
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,040
shaking so really get familiar with

1121
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,079
everything find out how everything works

1122
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,240
because you don't want to

1123
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,520
you know

1124
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,880
you don't want to

1125
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,760
try and learn that on site and then at

1126
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,359
the end when you need to present the

1127
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,440
video to the client

1128
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,000
you want to make sure that it's a nice

1129
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,160
video and everything is okay

1130
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,240
so

1131
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,319
correct

1132
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,800
awesome we got two more phases to go

1133
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,760
through

1134
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,200
um before we get to our conclusions

1135
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
oh don't forget your get out of jail

1136
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,599
free card now we meant we call her to

1137
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,280
get a job free card in this industry

1138
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,920
into each other uh but in reality don't

1139
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,599
call it get out of jail free card if you

1140
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,760
call get caught um

1141
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,000
call it a letter of authorization or an

1142
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,280
authorization letter right um

1143
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,800
people don't really like it when you

1144
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,560
used to call it a get out of jail free

1145
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,520
card especially law enforcement officers

1146
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,640
i just wanted to stick that to it

1147
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,760
breach

1148
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,240
now you could bring your gear right

1149
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,560
part of your gear is the authorization

1150
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,640
letter letter of authorization

1151
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,319
um know your plan

1152
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,680
stick to it

1153
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,599
right stick to the time frames that you

1154
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,599
have set up

1155
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,240
there you put them there for a reason

1156
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,119
um trust your gut know when to get out

1157
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,800
right uh it's very important uh we have

1158
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,200
the sixth sense around us not

1159
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,359
means a lot of but everybody so if you

1160
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,680
just have a feeling

1161
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,839
time to bug out right you've done it a

1162
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,440
couple times

1163
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,480
trust your gut go back watch

1164
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,000
and go from there

1165
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,480
lastly remember your car keys

1166
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,599
i say that because i didn't and

1167
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,440
after trying to breach building and

1168
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,040
having to go back in

1169
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,079
and and reassess i realized i left my

1170
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,480
car keys and our uh

1171
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,400
rental truck and had to break into the

1172
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,920
truck at two o'clock in the morning

1173
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,720
after not a successful attempt uh first

1174
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,720
attempt after preaching the building and

1175
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,280
the car alarm was going off and drawing

1176
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,000
mass amounts of attention to us so uh i

1177
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,760
put that in there always remember the

1178
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,119
car keys

1179
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,839
not a good idea to break it to a car

1180
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,800
and also for the authorization letter

1181
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,760
make sure that you print out a separate

1182
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,319
a lot of copies of that and

1183
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,400
make sure that you have them somewhere

1184
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,839
on you where it's

1185
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,520
easily reachable

1186
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,359
not only by you but also for example for

1187
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,119
like the law enforcement officer that

1188
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,079
you know exactly where it's at in case

1189
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:28,960
if

1190
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,240
you know

1191
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,640
the operation goes south and you would

1192
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,240
be stopped

1193
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,880
um so make sure that you have

1194
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,880
a lot of them are out there and also

1195
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,040
when it comes to the authorization

1196
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,280
letter make sure that

1197
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,680
your client really knows what's

1198
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,240
happening when is going to be happening

1199
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,319
and make sure that they are uh on the

1200
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,800
phone so if something is

1201
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,560
not going the way that it's supposed to

1202
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,800
be that they are available and they can

1203
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,079
really like they escalate the whole

1204
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,480
situation it is

1205
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,599
important

1206
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,400
so

1207
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,040
talk to your client talk to your project

1208
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,000
manager make sure all of the what-ifs

1209
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,480
are discussed not only with your partner

1210
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,880
but also with all of the decision makers

1211
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,520
and everyone who is involved in the

1212
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,000
engagement

1213
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,160
right

1214
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,520
correct

1215
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,760
last phase this is the one that often

1216
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,079
gets glamorized in the movies and tv

1217
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,200
shows

1218
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,880
site exploitation

1219
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,480
to us it's

1220
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,960
okay it's the last thing

1221
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,880
uh we hit you're already inside the

1222
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,920

hit your objectives

1224
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,560
get out the longer you stay in there the

1225
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,720
longer your uh the greater your chances

1226
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,119
of being detected the greater chance of

1227
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,720
things to go wrong so hit your

1228
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,480
objectives

1229
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,280
get out don't linger and stick to the

1230
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,319
plan

1231
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,280
if you do those things it'll be great

1232
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,839
get in get out

1233
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,280
all right

1234
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,160
yep stick to the plan always

1235
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,480
always right

1236
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,760
and now

1237
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,079
our conclusions

1238
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,880
right good oceans

1239
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,359
does equal higher success rate right if

1240
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,760
you just go up there and yolo it

1241
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
you're not going to be able

1242
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,319
you may work one time two times but as

1243
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,520
your clients

1244
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,599
uh increasing difficulty your success

1245
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,520
rate's gonna plummet right

1246
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,720
make sure that you have proper

1247
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,240
documentation

1248
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,760
not just for you

1249
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,920
uh but most importantly it's for the

1250
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,839
report remember you're not doing this

1251
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,520
engagement just for the pure joy and

1252
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,440
rush of it you're doing it to help

1253

better your client and the more

1254
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,559
information you give them in the report

1255
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,480
the better they're going to be

1256
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,040
communication is a must every step of

1257
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,319
the way

1258
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,400
right make sure that your client knows

1259
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400

1267
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,839
multiple scenarios always plan for the

1268
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,640
what ifs i cannot underscore this enough

1269
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,839
just having that mental exercise one

1270
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,160
helps prayer you prepare you for those

1271
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,079
what if scenarios but also helps ease

1272
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,440
your mind

1273
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,839

00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,640
authorization

1276

always have proper attire

1278
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,240
right you don't want to be wading

1279
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,079
through a swamp at two o'clock in the

1280
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,119
morning

1281
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,480
and you know

1282
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,400
nice slacks and and dress shoes

1283
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,520
uh

1284
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,400
always

1285
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,880
rehearse before you do anything right

1286
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,400
we're talking about a mental rehearsal

1287
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,960
here not a physical one stick to the

1288
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,760
plan

1289
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,599
stick to your time frame

1290
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,319
know when to disengage trust your gut

1291
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,559
and don't be leroy jenkins

1292
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,240
um for us

1293
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,599
90

1294
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,000
of the engagement is intel gathering

1295
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,599
pattern life

1296
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,760
establishing a pattern of life and

1297
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,760
analysis and planning only ten percent

1298
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,599
of the engagement is breach and site

1299
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,119
exploitation

1300
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,520
right so let that sink in ninety percent

1301
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,400
is is the work that goes in prior to so

1302
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,559
the stuff not shown in hollywood and

1303
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,240
then 10 of the work is the stuff

1304
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,480
hollywood shows you

1305
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,079
again

1306
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,559
don't be leroy jenkins

1307
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,520
absolutely um and also

1308
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,520
another thing to add when it comes to

1309
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,040
proper attire that goes not only to

1310
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,440
like the clothes that you wear for you

1311
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,839
know uh physical engagement and let's

1312
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,599
say there is

1313
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,079
no possibility to like run into any

1314
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,200
people so you'll find but also if you

1315
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,599
have to kind of like think on your feet

1316
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,640
or if you have a certain pretext make

1317
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,440
sure that your appearance matches the

1318
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,920
pretext and you

1319
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,160
you know fit in this image of who you

1320
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,839
pretend to be because uh it matters we

1321
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,920
all look at people in our initial

1322
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,760
reaction you know when we're trying to

1323
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,880
kind of like put everything uh together

1324
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,440
when something is slightly off

1325
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,760
our brain automatically rings all sorts

1326
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
of signals notifying us like okay

1327
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,119
something is

1328
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,000
not right so make sure when you prepare

1329
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
for um

1330
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,280
physical engagement especially if it has

1331
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,440
uh some sort of like a social

1332
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,359
engineering component in it when you

1333
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,040
know that you're gonna have to interact

1334
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,640
with people multiple people uh make sure

1335
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,839
that you dress

1336
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,000
appropriately uh caveat there if you're

1337
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,079
a sports fan do not wear your sports

1338
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,040
attire

1339
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,359
there because that will will

1340
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,480
you know

1341
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,119
place you out of there right for example

1342
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,920

1348
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,280

1349
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,520
