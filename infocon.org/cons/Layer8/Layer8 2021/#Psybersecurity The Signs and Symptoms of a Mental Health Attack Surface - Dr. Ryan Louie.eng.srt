and symptoms of a mental health attack

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,840
service i want to give my thanks to the

to talk with everyone today

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,439
as a psychiatrist i always ask my

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,720
favorite question how are you feeling

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
and right now for many of you

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,680
you're looking at the player at

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,680
conference talks and experiencing the

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
sessions and there might be a lot of

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,920
things going through your mind right now

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,600
and the range of thoughts and emotions

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
and things that you're experiencing can

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
be of a wide range and we take a look at

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,760
this through a mental health inventory

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
there could be a lot of things going on

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
and it might even look something like

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,039
this

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,199
there's a lot of words here on the

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,438
screen describing many different types

25
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,560
of emotions thoughts and feelings

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,760
and everyone to some degree experiences

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,520
these at different points in different

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,080
moments in a different kind of context

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,640
but it shows that there's a broad group

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,799
of things in the mind and it's amazing

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,600
that all these can fit within the space

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,439
of a brain

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,759
as i was thinking about this idea of the

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,880
attack surface i was looking at

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
the physical dimensions of the brain

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
itself

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
the surface area of the brain

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,759
and

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,159
the surface area of this brain of the

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,960
cerebral cortex it's actually about two

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
and a half square feet it's about

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,600
four open uh pages of a newspaper as

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
shown here

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,680
but what we do know is that

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,399
the words printed on paper

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
and the thoughts and emotions and the

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,079
feelings

48
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,960
in the mind definitely go beyond just

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,119
the surface level and could be something

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,560
deeper

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,399
and whether or not

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,840
a person with bad intentions has access

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
or manipulates

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,040
that content

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
is of importance here in our discussion

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,599
during the covet 19 pandemic there have

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,560
been tremendous impacts in all areas of

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
daily life affecting everyone

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
there are effects on people's health

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,680
and

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
their professions their work working

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,120
from home

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
the boundaries between what is work and

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,080
what is personal life has been blurred

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,599
many times

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,879
there's a lot of

67
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,519
different things in in the news and

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,280
information including

69
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,840
good information and misinformation

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,720
uh there's a big uh effect on the

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
economy and their finances both at the

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,200
global level and also at the personal

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
level for people

74
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,280
and of course there's the feeling of

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
security and well-being

76
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,319
the kobe 19 pandemic has certainly

77
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,480
challenged these aspects of daily life

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
and continue to do so and there are

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,000
other many issues as well

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,360
cyber attackers and people with bad

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
intentions have certainly

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,680
looked into each of these areas and

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
tried to take advantage of each of these

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,599
elements and more for their own purposes

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,920
the fbi

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
internet crime complaint center or the

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,799
ic3 comes out with a report every year

88
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,879
and here is the data from the internet

89
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,599
crime report from 2020

90
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,239
and it shows in this chart that there

91
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,040
are many different types of cyber crime

92
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
and it lists the number of victims for

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,280
each

94
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,080
for every type of cyber crime there is a

95
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,879
mental health impact component to it

96
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,920
for example for victims of identity

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,799
theft or data breach

98
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,120
people sometimes tell me that they feel

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
violent or they might experience

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
paranoia or feel anxious

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,639
they might even start to develop habits

102
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,798
where they avoid the use of technology

103
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,279
or distrust it so there are definitely

104
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,639
impacts in terms of a mental health

105
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,360
effect from cyber crime and of cyber

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
attacks

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
we know that

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,639
there are very

109
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,520
common things experienced by people in

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,360
the medical profession as well as

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
security professions such as cyber

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
security

113
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
both professions have a high degree of

114
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,759
work stress in their warm in their

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,240
environments and it is a constantly

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
changing type of landscape

117
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
oftentimes the information cannot be

118
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,880
shared which also means that the people

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
who are working these fields cannot

120
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,520
freely express or or seek help in the

121
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
traditional ways that other people would

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
just because of the nature of the things

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,759
that they work with

124
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,600
oftentimes uh people in these

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,919
professions are asked to make very

126
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,440
difficult decisions when there's not

127
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
enough information or not everything is

128
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
known

129
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
they always have to keep up with

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
constantly evolving types of situations

131
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,440
and and and

132
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,919
situations with knowledge

133
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,039
and it's always a different

134
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,080
feel and a different type of scenario

135
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,759
that can be shifting

136
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,039
um people are always on alert and they

137
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,800
always have to look out for

138
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
the new left field type of item that has

139
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
never been seen before

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,639
and there are oftentimes pressures from

141
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,039
the good time limited resources and of

142
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,199
course the nature and culture of team

143
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,320
dynamics

144
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
and how people function at work so

145
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
several different stress areas for both

146
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,680
of these students

147
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,080
now we know that in cyber security there

148
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
are mental health issues

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
of several types including things like

150
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,160
stress burnout it could be anxiety or

151
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,680
depression

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
there could be even other kind of

153
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,720
issues as well including

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,160
substance use issues uh

155
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,800
personality uh issues uh delusions or

156
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
paranoia or ptsd type of symptoms so a

157
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,080
wide range of mental health issues and

158
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
these impacts can be on both first

159
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,440
responders and victims and these might

160
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,319
be the same person

161
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,759
so the security of people and the

162
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
security of tsunami actually becomes one

163
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,120
in the same as technology becomes so

164
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,599
entwined and intertwined with our daily

165
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,039
lives so

166
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,199
psychiatry plus the combination of cyber

167
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,199
disparity makes cyber security

168
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
and there is the mental health attack

169
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,280
service that we were talking about here

170
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,960
but it's mental health attack surface

171
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
how do you know if something might be

172
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,759
happy

173
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,280
that's something there might be an issue

174
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,440
going on there's a couple things that we

175
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
can look at and i'll go through each of

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,599
these items here to describe what they

177
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,960
might be and these can be very useful to

178
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,919
identify if a mental health tax surface

179
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,560
is there and to understand some ways in

180
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,800
which how we might be able to manage it

181
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,800
the first one is about hippocratic oath

182
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,120
physicians take the hippographic oath to

183
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
provide ethical care

184
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,919
to do first of all no harm

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,720
people with bad intentions have what i

186
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,560
call the anti-hippocratic oath they

187
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
first do other things

188
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,520
and

189
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
those other things are

190
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
likely to be opposite to what the

191
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
hippocratic oath embodies

192
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
so for this

193
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
we encourage people to always ask

194
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
questions such as those questions asked

195
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,120
by a journalist

196
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,199
the who's the what

197
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,000
the whens the where's the house and most

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
importantly the why

199
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,800
why is somebody asking this type of

200
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
information of us

201
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,039
and and who are they what do they want

202
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,519
in what context does this happen

203
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,479
and and and in which kind of ways

204
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,159
understanding all of these elements is

205
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,799
really important to uh know

206
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,839
how a person is interacting with you or

207
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,399
as i tell all my patients that

208
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,800
any type of medication or treatment or

209
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
thing that you consume such as news or

210
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
things you read becomes a part of

211
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,519
yourself and you want to be able to feel

212
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
comfortable with what is is entering

213
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
your system so similar to this uh

214
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,120
graph

215
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
diagram here you always want to look at

216
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,720
who it is that you are working with and

217
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
what items you are using

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
i think it's also helpful to

219
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,880
always think about how physicians think

220
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,560
and here's an example of a physician's

221
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,120
path of thinking and a common medical

222
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
note structure

223
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
often times physicians

224
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
meet a patient and start with a chief

225
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,720
complaint it's what the patient comes to

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
see the the physician for in terms of a

227
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,480
problem

228
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
the physician would conduct an interview

229
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,600
and and gather information and learn

230
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,680
about that patient's history of present

231
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,600
illness or how that condition came to be

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
for psychiatrists they would look at the

233
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
past psychiatric history things that

234
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
happened in the past

235
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
we would also look at medical issues

236
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
that occurred in the past past medical

237
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,680
history

238
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
we look at things like the social

239
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,959
history in terms of

240
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,079
work and family and

241
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,079
substance use kind of issues and and

242
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,800
all these things that people enjoy

243
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,560
all that information

244
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
we will look at family history in terms

245
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,120
of

246
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
other people in the family with uh

247
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,519
mental health issues or other medical

248
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,279
issues

249
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,839
then we would do the mental status exam

250
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,640
which looks at things like any

251
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,959
move symptoms and uh cognitive uh issues

252
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,120
a um uh

253
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,160
auditorium of visual hallucinations

254
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,600
and other things

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,079
we look through the review of systems uh

256
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,959
looking at each system step by step to

257
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,320
look to see if there are any issues

258
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,200
there

259
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
and then we would have uh other

260
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,839
information

261
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,240
from uh clinical information or labs

262
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,079
that could uh help in our in our

263
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,120
treatment

264
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
then we put all this information

265
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
together and come up with an assessment

266
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
and then finally come up with what we

267
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600
think could be occurring building our

268
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
list of diagnoses

269
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,279
and then for this uh list of diagnosis

270
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
we create a list of what we think could

271
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,959
be

272
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,800
most likely

273
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,959
diagnosis and then going down the list

274
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,399
to lesser

275
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,720
and finally we come up with the patient

276
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,160
with a treatment plan

277
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
so this way of thinking goes from the

278
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
top to the bottom starting from the

279
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,680
patient's problem all the way down to a

280
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
plant

281
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,560
now people who

282
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
have bad intentions such as cyber

283
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,240
attackers

284
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,720
might use the reverse the opposite of

285
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,399
the sequence of thinking

286
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,240
they would

287
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
identify a target

288
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,959
and

289
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,519
uh have in mind what they wanted to

290
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,399
create and essentially they are working

291
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,120
towards creating a new problem

292
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
and this might involve them looking at

293
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,120
different aspects of a patient's history

294
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,519
and of condition and of

295
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,560
a current

296
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
situation and build backwards

297
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,279
through various different means to

298
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,399
create a new type of issue or to make it

299
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,279
worse or to somehow

300
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,560
manipulate a person's mental health

301
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,359
for their objectives

302
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,480
another element is the idea of precision

303
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,639
medicine

304
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
in this kind of case here we could think

305
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,680
of it as

306
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,160
care that's being designed specific for

307
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
a particular patient

308
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,480
the patient is

309
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,959
here to receive some care let's say at a

310
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720
clinic or at a hospital or from a

311
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
provider

312
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,680
and it might follow this type of

313
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,839
trajectory where the patient as we

314
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,240
described before comes up with a problem

315
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,480
and there's an interview a diagnosis is

316
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,639
made followed by an assessment for the

317
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,320
treatment and we monitor for the

318
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,839
patient's response

319
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,760
and each treatment plan would be

320
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,839
tailored specifically for the needs of

321
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,480
that patient

322
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,639
people with bad intentions might

323
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,720
now use and misuse this use of precision

324
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,200
medicine and create something called

325
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,160
psychiatric engineering for example if

326
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
signs and symptoms are exploited in

327
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,920
terms of a mental health exploit

328
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,639
that might lead to an altered interview

329
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
with the physician

330
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,200
leading to an engineered diagnosis

331
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,760
the assessment would be altered followed

332
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
by an altered treatment and then the

333
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,120
response of the patient would be

334
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,279
compromised

335
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,440
you might imagine that a scenario such

336
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,560
as this might not be even uh to the

337
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,480
awareness of the patient or the

338
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,720
physician and it may not be entirely

339
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,480
clear in terms of what might be

340
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,360
happening or if there is something of a

341
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,920
type of mental health back door so to

342
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,639
say that's underlying the whole process

343
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,839
uh and it's not being uh aware of if

344
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,079
that's not that's not to the attention

345
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,560
or the awareness of the patient or the

346
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,040
physician

347
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,120
so that brings us to this idea of

348
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,720
the things of

349
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,079
courses zebras or things that are beyond

350
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,320
that in medical school they always teach

351
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
us about you know knowing the things

352
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,079
that are common so the horses you have

353
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,199
to know those they're bread breaded

354
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,279
butter but then they also teach us that

355
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,720
we always have to look out for the

356
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,079
zebras things that are rare but

357
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,639
important because of their significance

358
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,680
and of their uh of their severity and

359
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,760
condition and oftentimes they're tested

360
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
on medical board exams so we have to

361
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,800
know those

362
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,320
um but then

363
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,560
to the far uh right here

364
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,199
are things unknown to the mind they are

365
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,279
things that have not even been

366
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,680
considered they weren't in a in a

367
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
person's uh uh

368
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
separate knowledge or experience and so

369
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,680
it is uh something that's that that

370
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,320
appears uh out of the blues

371
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,880
and um and i think in cyber security

372
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
that would be called something like a

373
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,600
zero day but there's always that type of

374
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,240
possibility even in this

375
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,639
so building that differential diagnosis

376
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,560
is something that not just physicians do

377
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,639
but i think everyone can do we always

378
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,800
have to look at what is common what is

379
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,000
rare and what could be that possibility

380
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,639
to always have that open mind when

381
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,120
assessing a situation or a type of

382
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,519
condition

383
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,160
a good example of where we can start and

384
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,880
to examine different examples of

385
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
an interaction or let's see a patient's

386
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
condition or

387
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,000
or or our setting is charlie brown

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,639
so with the the holidays uh coming

389
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,040
around the corner uh there's a classic

390
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,079
uh holiday television special called a

391
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,920
charlie brown christmas

392
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,519
and um

393
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,240
in this case charlie brown the character

394
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,199
here

395
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,440
feels depressed despite the holiday

396
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,199
season and

397
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,399
charlie brown seeks the help of lucy the

398
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,920
psychiatrist which is shown in this

399
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,759
screen capture here

400
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,600
now there's several things just in this

401
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
snapshot that we can look at to think

402
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,560
about this this idea of like who's

403
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,360
helping us and and what type of care is

404
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,600
being sought after and and whether or

405
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,880
not the

406
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,480
the results are effective or not or safe

407
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,519
i've circled a couple things here in

408
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,040
this this uh image and that uh that

409
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,800
shows some interesting things the first

410
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,959
one at the top is five cents it's the

411
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,320
idea of a finance and a

412
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,480
there is certainly a financial component

413
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,680
to health care and receiving care and

414
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,920
and and the interactions and means and

415
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,600
emotions of that

416
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,079
are very complex oftentimes and that

417
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,000
they can definitely have an impact on a

418
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,439
person's mental health

419
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,400
that canister of coins for for lucy she

420
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,079
actually asked

421
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,480
charlie brown to deposit five cents

422
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
before the session started so that idea

423
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,400
of a conflict of interest or that that

424
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,880
motive or that element of finance is

425
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,640
that could alter a relationship between

426
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,359
a

427
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,880
physician and a a patient here

428
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,679
and extend it uh to a broader sphere the

429
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,919
interactions between a person and the

430
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
other people that you work with

431
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,280
you see lucy's expression here of being

432
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,600
very satisfied with the coin that

433
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,160
charlie brown has just deposited and she

434
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,120
feels very satisfied with it and um and

435
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,400
and so the the motives of people of

436
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,320
who they are and and what they're trying

437
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,520
to do and

438
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
where their mindset is is it aligned

439
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,480
with what we want uh in terms of the

440
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,360
service or is it somewhere else

441
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,880
uh finally at the booth it says the

442
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,360
doctor is real in so the doctor like you

443
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,400
know who is a doctor and uh or extended

444
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,559
to a brother's sense who are these

445
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,720
people what are their roles and what are

446
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,799
they uh portraying and who are they

447
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,480
really uh

448
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,039
as uh who are they really uh serving us

449
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,480
in terms of people

450
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,760
and there

451
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
looks like lucy the psychiatrist is

452
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
really in but that's that brings up a

453
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,480
great question

454
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,559
in terms of really in what does that

455
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,160
what does that mean are they physically

456
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
here in terms of presence in terms of

457
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,480
their mindset and their their their

458
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,960
motives and their their ability and

459
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
desire to help and serve the person is

460
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
that religion

461
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,880
we have in the lower left hand corner a

462
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,360
circle around snow this is a this is a

463
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,679
setting of a secondary booth in the

464
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,960
middle of a

465
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,840
a snowy kind of place outside so it just

466
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,400
brings up the idea of saying it's the

467
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
idea of where the interaction is

468
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
occurring and what type of place what

469
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,679
kind of conditions and finally perhaps

470
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,520
even most importantly we look at the

471
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
expression feelings and thoughts of

472
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
charlie brown the patient here

473
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
in this picture he uh charlie brown

474
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,960
seems uh kind of depressed and

475
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,360
maybe he's kind of anxious and we've

476
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,000
known from charlie brown's

477
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
story that there could be some uh

478
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
depression there could be some anxiety

479
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
but could this be something more like a

480
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
major depression

481
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
like a major depressive disorder or a

482
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,320
generalized anxiety disorder

483
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
certainly

484
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
lucy the psychiatrist here ultimately i

485
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
think helps out charlie brown because

486
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,840
she invites charlie brown to participate

487
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,640
and to take a lead in the community

488
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,039
christmas play which ultimately uh lets

489
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,640
him uh discover his meaning in purpose

490
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,480
and he actually feels much much better

491
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,039
at the at the end of the story but in

492
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,080
other cases there may not be people um

493
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,360
like obviously the psychiatrist or other

494
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,559
other people

495
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,360
there can be people who tilt

496
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,320
the scales towards more of a major

497
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,559
depressive disorder as opposed to let's

498
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,400
say just a depression we know that

499
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,799
charlie brown has this reoccurring

500
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,440
depression uh every every year around

501
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,679
the first couple weeks of december when

502
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,000
the show airs and then we know that at

503
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
the end of the episode at the end of the

504
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,960
show

505
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,720
feels better and then we see him again

506
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,640
uh the following year

507
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
but there can be situations where the

508
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,960
the symptoms might be manipulated in

509
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,080
terms of

510
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
their effects

511
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,159
that the conditions of the

512
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,520
settings might be altered so as to serve

513
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,080
a purpose for someone who has different

514
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,520
intentions and we always have to look

515
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,559
out for that

516
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,799
somewhere for the anxiety aspect of

517
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,799
things charlie brown

518
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,720
seems to be worried about something and

519
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,960
um and although he

520
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,120
may not have

521
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
to a degree of let's say a general

522
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
anxiety disorder or it's actually we

523
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
don't know because uh

524
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,799
lucy's psychiatrist has not really asked

525
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,240
all the questions that we typically

526
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,039
would but it's the idea that with a

527
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,760
certain set of conditions can conditions

528
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,400
be made worse with other manipulations

529
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,640
and other other techniques and we should

530
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,679
always look out for those

531
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,760
[Music]

532
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,840
so here's a summary of a set of things

533
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,919
where we should

534
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,840
recognize the features of a mental

535
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,200
health exploit or an image

536
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,880
these are certain things that we could

537
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,919
all do to always be cognizant to always

538
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,640
be aware of what's happening around us

539
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,200
we start out by that question of my

540
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
favorite question and maybe everyone's

541
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,120
favorite question how are you feeling we

542
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,600
have to ask who is asking this question

543
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,640
why do they want to know and and who

544
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,880
else is looking at this from this type

545
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
of perspective besides just us

546
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,760
it's always important to learn about

547
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,080
what kind of emotions and thoughts and

548
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
feelings are in your

549
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,880
current uh mindset at this current time

550
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,919
and of other times as well you want to

551
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,159
know the whole landscape of everything

552
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,480
that is available because by being aware

553
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,640
of things that are there we're more able

554
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,039
to address it if they occur and that

555
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,520
these types of emotions or feelings or

556
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,799
thoughts uh come to the surface

557
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,200
uh we talked about the hippocratic oath

558
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
and the

559
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,880
anti-hippocratic oath that is that is

560
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,600
done by people who have uh bad

561
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,679
intentions

562
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,760
approach so we ask these questions of

563
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,640
the the why is the the house the lens

564
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,960
the food the wires the whats they're

565
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,039
always understanding and

566
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,360
at a very dynamic type of pace always

567
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,480
checking in

568
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,600
what are the answers to those questions

569
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,960
we talked about

570
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,440
the opposite reverse sequence of

571
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,559
thinking and of and of doing of people

572
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,520
who have bad intentions of uh

573
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
going through the process of how a

574
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
medical condition or psychiatric issue

575
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,960
is is addressed and it's going opposite

576
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,120
with the order of what a physician might

577
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,919
do

578
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,159
and and how that might be useful is that

579
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,880
in thinking about how physicians

580
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,600
think in terms of the process of care we

581
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,480
might be able to be cognizant when

582
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
something does not seem to fit that

583
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,440
pattern if something else uh occurs in

584
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,960
which it makes you kind of think you

585
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,200
know that's an unusual sort of sequence

586
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,080
or or why would they uh you know go in

587
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,960
this type of way anything that might uh

588
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,840
trigger a type of uh curiosity or

589
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,679
something that's unusual or something

590
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,039
that doesn't feel right you know

591
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,799
understanding the sequence in the

592
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,720
pathway is important so that we can

593
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,799
detect things that may not necessarily

594
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,559
follow that

595
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,679
pattern

596
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,919
and finally uh there's the there's the

597
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,600
use of

598
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,159
male use of precision medicines things

599
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,640
that are precisely tailored for a

600
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,039
patient's care and to

601
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,200
twist it and to make it

602
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,080
used in different ways and manipulate it

603
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,960
so that psychiatric engineering occurs

604
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,720
so whereas physicians tailor a patient's

605
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,360
care specifically for that patient

606
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,159
a person with bad intentions might use

607
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,600
that precision knowledge to manipulate a

608
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,919
person's mental health in a way that

609
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,279
serves their purposes

610
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,520
we always look for things

611
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,799
of

612
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,279
things that are common to horses look at

613
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,360
things that are rare but important to

614
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,640
know and with

615
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,400
more severe consequences

616
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,120
and effects in terms of zebras and also

617
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,080
we

618
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,240
should always keep in mind for things

619
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
that are not immediately known to

620
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,520
ourselves to always explore to always

621
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,200
have that communication for the people

622
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,520
that need cheaper knowledge and

623
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,960
antennas

624
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,520
updated and actively receiving

625
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,080
information

626
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,120
i always like to let everyone know that

627
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,640
deep down

628
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,240
everyone has their dna as a human being

629
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,080
the aspects of

630
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,120
wanting to be well for the mental health

631
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,799
don't need to be a

632
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,120
psychiatrist to do this we don't need to

633
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,679
be a mental health professional everyone

634
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,840
has a voice and an

635
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,919
expression and a viewpoint about mental

636
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,919
health and everyone can do something uh

637
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,120
to to uh to help out uh here are some

638
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,400
general uh things that people can do to

639
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
design their own pathway forward um it's

640
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,400
important to dedicate time for

641
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,799
themselves that things for fun and

642
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,559
spending time with uh

643
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,400
with family or friends or doing things

644
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,760
that are not related to work have

645
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,039
hobbies

646
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,520
and um take a moment for self-reflection

647
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
and do it regularly set aside that time

648
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
on the calendar uh for for a person for

649
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,880
themselves it might be taking a walk or

650
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,039
doing some journaling doing mindfulness

651
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,880
activities or other things there's a

652
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,240
wide range of things that people can do

653
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,720
we should always keep in communications

654
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,360
with people that you trust and to look

655
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,080
out for each other and this can include

656
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,880
friends or families or people involved

657
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,240
in their care it doesn't have to be a

658
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,559
lot of people but it can be a core set

659
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,320
of people that you can go to when you

660
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,559
need some help and always keep learning

661
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,799
about mental health and to try to take

662
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,360
the care and and the health if you need

663
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,520
to stay in touch with your your

664
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,039
physician and

665
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,279
let them know how you're doing and

666
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,200
reach out to them for any care that's

667
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
needed

668
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,679
and um as an organization and as a

669
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,880
person at the individual level everyone

670
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
has the ability

671
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,200
to create cultural change

672
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
through mental health leadership

673
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,919
in their own ways and then to

674
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,440
make mental health a key component of

675
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,360
their daily routine and their

676
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,600
organization's mission

677
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,559
and always it's important to

678
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,320
stay connected with the community

679
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,679
especially from different fields and

680
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,520
different backgrounds i've certainly

681
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,320
learned a lot from people outside my old

682
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
field of psychiatry and i think it's

683
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,200
working together building that big uh

684
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,360
sphere of knowledge with everyone else

685
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,840
contributing and to exchange ideas

686
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,480
that's the way how we can uh build uh

687
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,200
resiliency to be stronger together

688
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,840
as a community

689
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,080
so i always like to tell people to

690
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,559
always start with security in mind and

691
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,520
that it's something that you can always

692
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,240
do wherever you want

693
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,320
