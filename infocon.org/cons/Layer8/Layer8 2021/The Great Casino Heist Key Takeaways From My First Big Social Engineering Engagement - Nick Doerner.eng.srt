the laughing underscore man

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,640
so you want to break into a casino

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,239
legally there's a few things that you

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,440
want to take into consideration

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,200
beforehand and we're going to cover

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
those really quick but rules rules rules

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,960
this includes your rules and engagements

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,719
anything that may come from a client

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,559
about what's off limits what's in scope

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,840
out of scope

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,520
any special procedures that they want

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
taken with anything these are extremely

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,280
important just because you want to make

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,600
sure that you're following everything

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
pretty much to the t from a client

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,719
client standpoint so that relationship

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,199
is positive and also one that's not

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,040
going to land you in any type of trouble

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
if something negative happens or you get

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,119
caught or there's something that that

34
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,439
may happen in between that's otherwise

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,680
going to land you in some hot water

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,320
documentation is key and documentation

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,360
is king

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,759
especially with with these types of

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,360
engagements where you're doing some sort

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,759
of physical or anything on-site because

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,920
when you look at it

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,200
you're going to want pictures notes

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,960
names and locations

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,159
when you're doing something like say an

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,240
external penetration test

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,000
you can you can always kind of go back

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
and and look at that you can if you

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,079
visited an exploited website and you

49
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,159
might need a url you can check that url

50
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,280
later on

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,880
when you're doing something physically

52
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,560
and you're on site and you're trying to

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,479
break into either building or an

54
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,479
organization you might you might not get

55
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,000
that luxury of being able to go back and

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,079
revisit areas so you really want to take

57
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
a very very detailed documentation

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,159
whenever possible and uh make sure that

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,520
everything's there so when it comes to

60
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,759
report time and uh debrief or

61
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,680
presentation time with your client uh

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,320
everything's ready to go and all set

63
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,040
and lastly signatures uh signatures are

64
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,038
huge especially if you're doing anything

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,959
physical and you get that little get out

66
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,560
of jail free card you want to make sure

67
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,520
that's properly signed and set up uh and

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,200
and ready to go and these these are

69
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
things that i've learned not only on

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,440
this engagement i'll be speaking about

71
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,599
but other engagements as well making

72
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
sure all those signatures are in place

73
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
and they're signed by the proper people

74
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,640
with the proper authority uh they're

75
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,000
really going to be huge especially for

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
making sure that

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
one you're successful but two if there

78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
are any failure points that they're ones

79
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,519
that don't land you in in a really

80
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,160
negative situation

81
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,480
so the steps taken for this engagement

82
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,280
uh they're pretty standard uh we we did

83
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,200
some information gathering we set up our

84
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
pretext and then went went to an

85
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,480
execution phase

86
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
and what i really like is with the

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,720
specific client they wanted us to

88
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,920
go in and start in a uh in a top-down

89
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,159
approach so take our ocean apply it to

90
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,840
fishing apply anything from fishing to

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,319
fishing apply anything from fishing

92
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,840
fishing and ocean all the way into

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,879
physical so we were able to basically

94
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,840
go in and have almost a a free reign of

95
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
how we wanted to do things uh with with

96
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
a few minor rules that we get we'll get

97
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920
into a little bit later

98
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,159
but looking at it what we were able to

99
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
do is uh take take all of our previous

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
findings and apply those to the next

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,159
step and uh we'll see that that that's

102
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,239
what led us to some major successes and

103
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,920
uh and big wins with throughout this

104
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,080
engagement

105
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,040
so osen some some key takeaways from the

106
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,879
ocean that we had on this one

107
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,040
um social media social media was a

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
really big one for us uh we searched

109
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
facebook twitter linkedin uh

110
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
specifically linkedin we got a lot of

111
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
names in there that were really useful

112
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,360
uh it's it's great when organizations

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,920
have a large linkedin presence from a uh

114
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
intelligence gathering standpoint

115
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
because it allows you to know who you're

116
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,200
dealing with what position they might

117
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,840
work in uh who they may have contact

118
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
with on a daily basis

119
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
and and what exactly you're going to be

120
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,280
looking for when you're inside the

121
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,040
organization

122
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,439
um facebook and twitter these were

123
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,280
really good for finding uh not only

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
layouts about the organization we did

125
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
find some employee photos as well we

126
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,959
also were able to see you know

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,120
especially with somewhere like a casino

128
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,798
they're going to usually have some sort

129
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,400
of social media presence especially for

130
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
the casino resort uh because they're

131
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
going to be posting you know

132
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
famous singers are coming or magicians

133
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
or or whatever they they may be doing

134
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
event wise are going to be posted well

135
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
in advance and and you can usually use

136
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
that to your advantage some way if you

137
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,199
want to incorporate that into your

138
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,880
pretext

139
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,240
one other thing that we went after

140
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
really hard that had a huge payoff and

141
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,479
we have a slide on the next a picture on

142
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
the next slide for it is the target

143
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,440
website um a lot of target websites will

144
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,320
have layouts especially with um

145
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,880
with the buildings being casino based

146
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
and entertainment based they they show

147
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,160
you know here's how you get from point a

148
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,240
to point b this is where where different

149
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
um areas of interest are located they

150
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,639
may not have a full building blueprint

151
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,160
or anything along those lines but they

152
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
have enough where you can kind of work

153
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,840
your way uh through and kind of work out

154
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,520
where things are located if you've never

155
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
been there before

156
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
um one one subset to that website is

157
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
going to be the careers page um i've

158
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,759
checked a few different casino websites

159
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,360
in in my time

160
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
outside of just this one and a lot of

161
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,039
them have careers pages that have

162
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
pictures of all the employees they have

163
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,360
their badges on and and we see that in

164
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,080
the next slide is that

165
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,840
on the careers page you get a really

166
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,600
good sense of how you should be

167
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
addressing what a badge layout layout's

168
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,039
going to look like what you should be

169
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,720
wearing what kind of orientation most

170
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
things are is the badge usually on the

171
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
left is usually on the right is there

172
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,840
usually a logo on there

173
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
what what exactly are the small nuances

174
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
it's the very small details that are

175
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,759
located in these

176
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,440
in these images that you can use to

177
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
further your pretext in your social

178
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
engineering engagements

179
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
lastly was google maps

180
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,039
even though that this

181
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,319
specific casino and resort was was

182
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,639
relatively small it was still big enough

183
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,800
to have quite quite a large area to

184
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,039
drive and walk through uh to the point

185
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,479
where google maps uh was kind of crucial

186
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,639
in figuring out which building was which

187
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,919
understanding which one was the main

188
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,000
casino which one were some offices that

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,520
they had to decide

190
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,360
which ones what might have been for you

191
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
know the pool area on the golf course

192
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
things like that

193
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
so right here we have a really good

194
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,840
example of the careers page this is for

195
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,360
my this is a picture from my local

196
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
casino uh this is not a casino i've ever

197
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
worked for in the past before i just

198
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
jumped down there for this uh

199
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
presentation and and grab this real

200
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
quick if we look here this is from their

201
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,639
their own careers page

202
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,039
we've got two staff members here we've

203
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
got a pretty good idea of what one of

204
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,479
the the small badges looks like just the

205
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,319
the little one right there on his uh

206
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,240
shoulder area and we've also got one

207
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
that looks like it's a uh a more

208
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,199
uh standard badge kind of like the one

209
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,919
that that i i had used uh that's got you

210
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,960
know your your staff id photo taken your

211
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,919
name uh what what you're doing and

212
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,759
possibly what um

213
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,440
what role position you're in maybe a

214
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,039
phone number an employee id number

215
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,800
something like that as well

216
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,639
um and and this is really good because

217
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,240
you can see you know what color shirt

218
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,520
should i be wearing what kind of pants

219
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,919
should i wear uh do i need to wear wear

220
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,960
full suit do i need a blazer do i need

221
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
uh what what other parts do i need to

222
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,599
kind of make my ensemble look the part

223
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,080
especially if i'm trying to go in

224
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,919
under the guise in the physical which we

225
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,440
did in this case

226
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
of trying to be an employee of i'm in

227
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
person someone who's supposed to be here

228
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
who works here

229
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
i'm just another person trying to get

230
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
their job done so so hopefully i won't

231
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
be bothered

232
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
uh so going from ocean we went right

233
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
into fishing and fishing was complete

234
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,759
and total failure for us

235
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,800
um

236
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
we we went in and we ended up taking a

237
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,759
bunch of phone numbers that that were

238
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,280
provided by the client because those

239
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,400
were the only ones that they allowed us

240
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,160
to use that were in scope

241
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,039
and

242
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
the issue that we ended up running into

243
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,080
is we did not prepare enough for this

244
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,479
specific part of of phishing the the

245
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
pretext was

246
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,960
pretty solid uh but it turns out all the

247
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,199
employees sat next to each other in the

248
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
same room

249
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,720
so with that in mind you know we call

250
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,879
jane doe first and and we get a little

251
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,039
bit of information then we call john doe

252
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,960
who sits right next to her and then they

253
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
start to talk and and that information

254
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,640
spreads really quickly especially in a

255
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,159
small room where everybody knows each

256
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,479
other is kind of tight knit and before

257
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,320
you know it we get three or four calls

258
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,519
down the line

259
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,640
and the the target goes

260
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,200
uh and i quote get a real job and stop

261
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,640
scamming people and click and and it's

262
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
it's okay covers blown at that point we

263
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,959
can't do any more for this engagement uh

264
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,800
we didn't get a whole ton because we got

265
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,600
shut down only a few calls in but hey we

266
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,959
still got something we we have some

267
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,800
stuff that we can provide the client it

268
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
also shows them that that they do have

269
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,399
some strengths in some areas

270
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,839
where someone were just to go down their

271
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,200
phone tree or their phone list and start

272
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
calling every single person they could

273
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
or every single extension

274
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,839
luckily they they're very good at

275
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,120
communicating amongst themselves

276
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,760
uh fishing was a much much higher

277
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,600
success rate we were allowed to fish the

278
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,279
entire organization

279
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,880
we were allowed to go for whoever we

280
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,680
wanted we did a a pretext to enter a

281
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,800
raffle for for a little giveaway um for

282
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
there's some reason

283
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,480
a lot of organizations that that i've

284
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,959
gone after in the past if you if you do

285
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,760
raffles and giveaways and enter to wins

286
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,160
people love it uh you you see an email

287
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,640
for free pizza you click it um think

288
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
think about even now

289
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
uh information security with our

290
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,839
conferences a lot of the conferences

291
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,240
have been virtual uh the last few years

292
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
with everything going on

293
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,959
so

294
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,880
a lot of the swag and a lot of the

295
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,640
stickers and a lot of the shirts you go

296
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
out there we a lot of people on

297
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,640
information security and infosec are are

298
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
pretty paranoid but if you tell them hey

299
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,160
we're gonna give you some free shirts or

300
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,240
a sticker or swag bag you know they're

301
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,320
pretty you're pretty fast put the home

302
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
address in there and and ask okay yeah

303
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
here we go here's my name here's my

304
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,560
address go ahead send that right in

305
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,200
um so so with that giveaway we had a 42

306
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
percent capture rate approximately

307
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,440
that's that's rounded up uh by to the

308
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,320
nearest percent uh we were allowed also

309
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,000
to go after the c-level uh executives so

310
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,200
we were able to go over cfo ceo uh and

311
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
and related areas and usually these are

312
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,760
ones that are generally either off

313
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,399
limits or they're ones that you

314
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,959
are very careful with uh because no no

315
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,240
ceo no cfo wants to get called out

316
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,120
as failing a phishing test

317
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
um so so with that in mind you got to be

318
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,399
a little bit careful with those

319
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,640
especially when you're working on client

320
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
relationships outside of just doing the

321
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,600
engagement

322
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,040
but that that is one that we were

323
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
explicitly told was allowed and we were

324
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
able to do

325
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,519
and uh just a quick big shout out to go

326
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,760
fish um there's plenty of talks and

327
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
videos out there and how to use it but

328
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,079
this by far my favorite tool for fishing

329
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,760
uh just does so much in in so little

330
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200
uh so little setup and so little

331
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,279
maintenance to use and it's it's really

332
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,440
a great tool if anyone's looking to

333
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
uh expand their tool set or their tool

334
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
kit with fishing uh that's definitely a

335
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,560
really good place that i highly

336
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
recommend to go into

337
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
so with the physical you'll see right

338
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,959
here we actually have this the id that i

339
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,839
used

340
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,760
um we can see i i put in the same

341
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
picture that's the most professional

342
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,240
picture i own of myself

343
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,720
on on that id i gave myself a fake

344
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,320
employee uh employee number i did redact

345
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,839
some of the information from here just

346
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,320
for for the client's sake and i i gave

347
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,760
myself um my regular name i didn't mind

348
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,320
that much and i also gave myself a role

349
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,639
of i.t administrator

350
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,639
one of the things that i've learned uh

351
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
from this engagement and from others is

352
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
that if you say you're from i.t and

353
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
you're working at the organization and

354
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,160
you tell someone you want to get behind

355
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
the computer for whatever reason uh if

356
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,959
you

357
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,120
generally play the part well they're

358
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,519
they're going to let you in there quite

359
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,839
a few times uh a large percentage of the

360
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,000
time they're like oh yeah yeah i i don't

361
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
want to deal with that you you're going

362
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,519
to fix the internet make it faster great

363
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,760
go go on behind the keyboard

364
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
um so so some of the rules that we did

365
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,519
have with the physical though

366
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,560
no accessing cash rooms um the the

367
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,480
client was very clear they didn't want

368
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
anybody going into the cash rooms not

369
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,639
into the casino vault they didn't want

370
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,839
us anywhere where money was being

371
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,200
handled um and complete completely

372
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,519
understandable too uh as much as i would

373
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,639
have loved to jump into the vault and

374
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,560
try to take money out and and try to go

375
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,959
full you know ocean's 11 on it it's

376
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,320
something that

377
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,360
you

378
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,279
need to adhere to especially when it's a

379
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,040
client client request and the client's

380
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,800
the one that that essentially is calling

381
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,160
the shots

382
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,200
um

383
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,440
one of the things that i also did

384
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,959
was i called myself an intern while i

385
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,639
was there i know the badge says i t

386
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
administrator but if somebody would

387
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,560
question hey i've never recognized you

388
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,320
the ite team's relatively small it's

389
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,279
only a dozen or so people um and i've

390
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,800
never seen you here before how are you

391
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,920
in i.t i say saying that i was an intern

392
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,959
was was pretty good um it got me a lot

393
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,200
of success especially in this or

394
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,279
specific organization especially because

395
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,480
this was about

396
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
uh this is about three and a half years

397
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
ago now

398
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
so with this organization i i looked a

399
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,959
little bit younger than i do now and i

400
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:31,839
already

401
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,399
hope i look relatively young um

402
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,160
but they they would accept that pretty

403
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,320
easily and allow me right through

404
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,560
um and one other thing just to note on

405
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
is we didn't do any fancy toys with us

406
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,920
um we you know i love the proxmark i

407
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,639
love uh doing doing badge cloning and

408
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,160
everything like that

409
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,399
everything that that i did

410
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,440
uh completely completely low-tech

411
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,920
we have the badge here

412
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,680
it's just just a chunk of plastic that

413
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,320
we cut to shape and print it on use it

414
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
using a printer

415
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,600
no

416
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
no cloning no no type of

417
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
attacks against any of the scanners or

418
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
anything along those lines

419
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,959
the most high-tech thing i had was my

420
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,079
phone and that was mainly for sitting

421
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,920
outside of doors pretending i'm on on a

422
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,519
call of some sort until somebody would

423
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,639
walk in and out so i don't look

424
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,800
suspicious on security cameras

425
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
or as suspicious i would say

426
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
um and the the other major component i

427
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
had was the clipboard um the clipboard

428
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,160
was huge uh dressing in a full suit with

429
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,920
a badge just like this i was wearing the

430
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,760
same exact clothes that you see in the

431
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,560
picture there so full suit with a tie

432
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240
and a clipboard

433
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
and the badge is just it got me just

434
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,360
about everywhere um people would hold

435
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,839
open doors people were extremely nice

436
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
and and especially in these types of

437
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,199
industries like casinos where it's

438
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,880
essentially a customer service and a

439
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,519
service industry um where the staff are

440
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,959
generally trained to help people and go

441
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,000
out of their way to make sure that

442
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
they're having a good time uh sometimes

443
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,880
that extends into the workplace uh to a

444
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
point where they might be a little too

445
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,920
helpful they're holding doors open for

446
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
people they may not know just letting

447
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,720
them walk right through without scanning

448
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,639
in uh no one shutting the door behind

449
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,160
them with the swipe and swipe out there

450
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,079
they're letting everyone who's in that

451
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,760
kind of line to get in through the door

452
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,160
through the door and um in into whatever

453
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,079
areas they're going to for work

454
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,600
and that that proved to be a very large

455
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,199
downfall for this

456
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
for this client

457
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
um so so as far as our findings go you

458
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
know how how do you pull off a casino

459
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,040
heist if you don't have access to the

460
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
vaults or the cash room because you know

461
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
it's it's out of scope

462
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,959
for for me specifically

463
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,639
we did that because we had full act

464
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,079
first off we did have full access to

465
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,160
every area uh aside from those ones that

466
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,759
were off limits so that's that's we got

467
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,040
our little

468
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
a little disclaimer there

469
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
but we were able to get into say

470
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,120
training rooms office spaces

471
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,000
uh the server rooms the power room and

472
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
electrical we could have turned off all

473
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,399
the power which would have been

474
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,519
interesting because they had their own

475
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,680
their own power supply

476
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
but really

477
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,240
one of one of the things that we were

478
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,959
able to physically steal were ipads

479
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,399
from the training room i think i think i

480
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
walked out with about 10 ipads in my bag

481
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
by the end of that um but it turns out

482
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,519
that we were able to find a flaw in

483
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
their in their business center

484
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,160
which was also located on site um

485
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,440
just going and sitting down in the

486
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,600
business center which most casinos and

487
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,560
resorts have most hotels have as well

488
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,399
um we were able to log in with the

489
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,759
credentials from the cfo that i

490
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,120
mentioned we captured during the

491
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,040
phishing engagement

492
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,519
and using those credentials brought me

493
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,399
in uh to a standard desktop screen

494
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,560
they they had some desktop icons that

495
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,079
allowed me to

496
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,320
then essentially just double click and

497
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,880
opens up my mail and go okay great i'm

498
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,600
the cfo let me log in credentials worked

499
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,560
great

500
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,320
from there we were able to see

501
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,639
hey the cfo's been getting emails from a

502
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,880
bank let's take a look at that

503
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
and it was it was showing um all the

504
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,120
transfers because the cfos account was

505
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
the one that was being used for

506
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,199
for all transfers of large money

507
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,439
transactions uh so

508
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,959
at the casino

509
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,959
at the end of every every week every two

510
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
weeks every month or whatever time

511
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,760
interval

512
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,799
they were

513
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
essentially depositing millions and

514
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,400
millions of dollars to their bank which

515
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
you know that makes sense

516
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,760
they're not going to keep it all in cash

517
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,880
all the time

518
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,760
but since i had access to the cfo's uh

519
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,919
internal account using those credentials

520
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,440
that that we were able to pick up from

521
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,320
phishing

522
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
i could you know reroute that money if i

523
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,600
wanted to i can go in and make it you

524
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
know uh lock him out of the account or i

525
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
can be a little more stealthy and try to

526
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,600
siphon as much funds as i can off before

527
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
anybody notices and logs in and sees

528
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
those strange transactions so so there's

529
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,919
a lot of things that we can do with that

530
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
access and essentially at that point

531
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,559
it's are we going to do a smash and grab

532
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,919
and try to try to take that money and

533
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,919
run or are we going to try to do it some

534
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,600
somewhat slower

535
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
and take off whatever money we need

536
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,160
because in the long run uh any any

537
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,039
threat that's going to target a casino

538
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,360
may not be after that that big payday of

539
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,320
you know

540
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,480
all the money at the casino uh

541
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,160
realistically you can live quite

542
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,480
comfortably off of just taking some of

543
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,880
the money from the casino especially

544
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,840
medium even even smaller casinos

545
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,160
where their transactions are equaling on

546
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,120
a daily basis several million dollars

547
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,080
quite quite easily so getting that money

548
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,960
and and getting out was really our goal

549
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
was the goal set forth by the client and

550
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,840
we were able to demonstrate that we

551
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
could do that without access to the cash

552
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,600
rooms or the vault uh because of

553
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
security flaws that were one in the

554
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
network but also

555
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
because of the ways that we weren't shut

556
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,360
down uh even though we were shut down in

557
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,240
the in the fishing portion our ocean

558
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,000
gave us enough that we were able to do

559
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,080
conduct a a fairly successful fishing

560
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,320
campaign and we were able to conduct a

561
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
very successful

562
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
physical campaign again against the

563
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,720
organization and essentially get in uh

564
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,280
find a way to access an account that we

565
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
otherwise shouldn't have been able to

566
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,360
get into

567
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,280
and and get out

568
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,600
and uh those were really a lot of the

569
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,559
really

570
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
high high points that allowed us to get

571
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,799
these findings and then exfiltrate um

572
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
without the client really knowing

573
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,960
knowing what hit them essentially we did

574
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
do a full stop at the bank account

575
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,799
access we didn't actually try to

576
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,080
transfer funds out um as as per our

577
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,000
agreement we would not actually steal

578
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
anything and not return it uh taking

579
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,080
transactions out through a bank account

580
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,000
is it's just too messy it's it's full

581
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,919
stop right there once you have access

582
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,080
ipads are much easier we can go back at

583
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
the end of the day and say here's here's

584
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,480
all of your ipads back sorry

585
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,120
uh so key takeaways here uh and a lot of

586
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,960
these are really learned the hard way

587
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,480
for me especially in this engagement uh

588
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,400
for one the hardest one to learn would

589
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,200
have been preparation is key uh fishing

590
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
fishing really went kind of rough

591
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
because we were just not as prepared as

592
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,720
we should have been when you when you

593
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,159
look at it from a large scale

594
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,280
perspective

595
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,679
we should have known better that those

596
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,679
employees were located in the same room

597
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,559
together

598
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,840
we should have

599
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
better understood how they would have

600
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,320
reacted to the fishing

601
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,760
employee that we were using when we were

602
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,400
trying to get information from them and

603
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,200
and that just kind of led to a

604
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,720
deterioration in in that test as a whole

605
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
another part is fishing is great but and

606
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
and that's not knocking fishing at all i

607
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,640
love fishing fishing is one of my

608
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,080
favorite things i think it shows a

609
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,840
really high business impact especially

610
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,360
when you do it well

611
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,600
and and it's not reported

612
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,120
but when you can couple fishing with

613
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,880
something else like physical or you can

614
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,559
couple fishing with an internal or an

615
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,799
external penetration

616
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,480
red team or penetration test engagement

617
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,559
depending on how how you conduct them

618
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,360
uh

619
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
fishing fishing is great

620
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,280
but fishing is even better when you can

621
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,520
then demonstrate how it can be used for

622
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,200
for business impact

623
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
uh the the other key takeaways dressed

624
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,240
apart had i not been wearing that suit

625
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,919
and and the client told us this during

626
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,159
the debrief because uh the ceo had never

627
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
met me before and and he was at the

628
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,120
debrief and he said hey yeah i saw you

629
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,360
and and i recognized you from from when

630
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,039
you were doing the physical testing we

631
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,400
we actually walked by each other a few

632
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,320
times the reason i didn't stop you was

633
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
you were in a full suit uh you had the

634
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
clipboard you were you're kind of going

635
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,919
straight straight out where you were

636
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,000
going you weren't really wandering

637
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
and you just looked like you needed to

638
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,360
go get something done so i just wasn't

639
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,000
going to bother you were getting away

640
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,919
and and for me that was a really big key

641
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,080
takeaway is dressing apart is

642
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,000
really a huge

643
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
uh a huge asset when it comes to doing

644
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,880
physicals and trying to you know heist a

645
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,760
casino because if you look the part and

646
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,200
you look like you're supposed to be

647
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
there and you just kind of blend in no

648
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,120
one really questions uh what what

649
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,880
exactly you're doing or why

650
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,520
uh another part act confident

651
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,000
uh even if you're not confident i was i

652
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,679
was a bundle of nerves that entire

653
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
engagement i was like i said my first

654
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,080
big social engineering engagement uh

655
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,600
fishing and fishing had done plenty of

656
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
times before as far as physical goes i

657
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
was among one of my

658
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,960
first few and going in there and being

659
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
able to

660
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,799
steal information or steal physical

661
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
devices and try to get into places i

662
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,159
shouldn't be you know your heart's kind

663
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,640
of kind of thumping you gotta kind of go

664
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
back to kind of almost a high school

665
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,840
theater or play type of moment where you

666
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
may be nervous up on that stage but

667
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,200
you're playing a part you're essentially

668
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,360
acting and trying to get into a place uh

669
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,799
that you shouldn't be instead of just

670
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,280
being up on stage in front of a crowd so

671
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,360
that's uh that's really important to me

672
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,679
is being able to act confident and uh be

673
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,200
confident kind of even if you have to

674
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,720
trick yourself into that mindset making

675
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
sure that that's the case

676
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,039
and then lastly clipboards just work i i

677
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,360
don't know what it is but every time i

678
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
go out with a clipboard and i've got you

679
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
know a piece of paper on it and a pen

680
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,039
people people tend to just leave you

681
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,240
alone if you've got a clipboard you know

682
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,600
it looks like you're writing stuff down

683
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,880
just trying to trying to get something

684
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,280
done so that's that's

685
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,600
i'm sure there's other talks that touch

686
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
on that but that's just a really big

687
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,880
thing that people let you get away with

688
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,559
so now hopefully there's enough time for

689
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,080
questions at the end of this

690
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,960
