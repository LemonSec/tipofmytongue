1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,000
greetings to all of you watching the

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,919
fourth layer eight conference from so

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,000
many places around the world

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,680
it is a great pleasure being part of

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,280
this year's event

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,440
and with a big thank you going out to

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,360
the organizers and the people that made

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,280
it possible

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,199
it is even more exciting for me as i

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,520
have the opportunity to present briefly

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,279
an idea something that i have been

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,760
working in the back of my head for so

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,359
many years now

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,519
and i have never attempted to put into a

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,720
presentable format until today

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,840
i will say at the end of the

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,920
presentation further reading resources

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,680
for those interested and of course the

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
github page where you can find more

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,879
identifiers compared to the sample in

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,680
this presentation

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,239
my name is dr gregorios fragos but i do

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,239
tend to prefer greg

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,480
due to the chosen length of my session

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,719
today i hope is enough to give you the

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
general idea pick your interest

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
hopefully keeps you interested

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
throughout the session and leave you

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,640
with enough time and hunger

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
to watch all the amazing talks scheduled

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,920
for today

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,320
i lived in the uk for almost 20 years

33
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,479
where i started research and engaged in

34
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,520
cyber security at so many fronts

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
conscious of time there is no need to

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
take you through my short bio at the

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
moment but give you a little back story

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,320
to understand the origins of this talk

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
you see when i was doing my master's and

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,600
my phd

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,920
my university along with the information

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,400
security research group which i was part

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,040
of was also the first and only one at

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
the time being that had a real digital

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
forensics lab

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,040
it was built to serve both academic work

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,280
and helping police investigations

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,000
related to computer crime

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
just fyi we were the first who published

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,079
the well-known disk study of publicly

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,360
purchased second-hand hard drives and

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,759
created specialized trainings for the

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,719
police on how to identify and seize

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,759
evidence

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,439
in crime scenes

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
that can potentially contain digital

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,799
evidence

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,840
or even lead to further

59
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,758
evidence during a case we ended up with

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,760
a number of audio files

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
even though we had other digital

62
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
evidence to recover data carve and

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,840
analyze it stuck to my head at that time

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,319
but it would be really cool to be able

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,480
to come to certain conclusions when

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,319
working with audiophiles

67
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,480
imagine something similar to linguistic

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,280
forensics but moreover where is someone

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,360
from and in that case

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
by only listening to that person keep in

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,440
mind

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,800
the idea was very unstructured and vague

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,319
at that time

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,640
as i was exposed to so many students

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,720
from all over the world it started

76
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,120
becoming something like a personal bet

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,519
to listen observe and try to identify

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,760
where is someone from especially those

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,800
who were speaking very good english

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
i didn't want to base it on someone's

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,560
accent

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,200
and that is the big differentiator in

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,879
the presentation you are currently

84
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,280
watching i wanted to identify if

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,480
possible

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,120
if certain words phrases the way that we

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
speak the way that we communicate

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
cannot necessarily tell

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
like someone has a tell when playing

90
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,680
poke or when specific hand gestures are

91
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
used by certain nationalities when

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
speaking

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,879
words or phrases that have a time

94
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,440
peculiarity

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,519
to give away more information more

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,000
intelligence if you may about the person

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
talking

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,840
at the time being the concept was

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
completely from an academic perspective

100
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,560
in my mind something like that could

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,120
potentially allow a profiler a social

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
engineer and investigator to narrow down

103
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,840
the background of the individual in

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,879
question

105
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,000
eventually under certain circumstances

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
could be used in different ways that

107
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
later on it became apparent that it is

108
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
also possible to use it both austin and

109
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,080
opsec for example

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
but as you can imagine that is something

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
for a future presentation

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,599
as i dived into this journey of making

113
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,360
observations

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,080
as it was a completely side project at

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,400
the back of my head i started over the

116
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,159
years reading different books

117
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,920
publications and textbooks about

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,440
language in general

119
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
i was trying to match and explain

120
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,400
somehow similarities and patterns

121
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,479
that notion is reflected in speech

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,840
spectrums

123
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,479
in which roughly translates as the

124
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,240
reason why there are certain

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,120
difficulties in saying pronouncing if

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,479
you may certain vowels and consonants

127
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,880
in languages other than our mother

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,960
tongue

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,280
in our example here you can see four

130
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,840
different meanings of exactly the same

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,680
word depending only on the tone used

132
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,800
which to the untrained ear obviously all

133
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
of them would be assumed to be the same

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
word as you can see there are four

135
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,479
different

136
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,280
pieces of the word ma

137
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,919
i do find this very fascinating i find

138
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,639
even more fascinating that cantonese can

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,759
spread across six different tones with

140
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,000
some claiming that it can be threads to

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,880
nine but most researchers seems to agree

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
at six

143
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
all that time and peculiarity is

144
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
imprinted with our mother tongue

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
friends environment the language is used

146
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,720
with family adds to it this imprint and

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,039
unconstantly we tend to say things by

148
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,759
emphasizing differently having our

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,639
distinctive speech spectrum

150
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,360
a few simple well-known examples between

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
american english and the queen's english

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
are tomato tomato advertisement

153
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,360
advertisement what what aluminum

154
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
aluminium

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,840
and my favorite one it is sql not

156
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,840
sql you can fight me afterwards on this

157
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
hope that introduction was useful enough

158
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
to set the scene

159
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
without further ado here's some example

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,440
of words that act as identifiers and

161
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
their respective reasons let's start

162
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
with cyprus as an honorary mention as it

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
was one of my first observations and

164
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,000
confirmed in many different ways please

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
note that most cypriots their actions in

166
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,400
english tends to be exceptional

167
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
asking someone to read

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,840
the expression i have a great culture

169
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,440
is a highly revealing tell for cypriots

170
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,120
even though the gria in great

171
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,600
sound is distinctive enough to identify

172
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
the tell that we're looking for

173
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,400
the word culture

174
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,160
is pronounced as culta every time

175
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,319
i actually had a unique opportunity to

176
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,160
cross verify this with a uk barista

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
first generation born in the uk

178
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
for someone to be a barista their

179
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,520
english is going to be near perfect to

180
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
the queen's english

181
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
the second tell is the expression

182
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
what are you looking at

183
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,880
obviously i cannot do it perfectly the

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,479
way that you would hear it from a

185
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,840
cypriot but

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,280
a question that ends with the word at

187
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,840
that comes right after a verb ending

188
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,759
with ing

189
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,960
is very distinctive similarly the what

190
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,400
word is tends to have a higher emphasis

191
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
on the add part

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,360
but not

193
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,240
that easy to identify by itself in

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,800
different combinations of sentences

195
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
let's start with a fun fact about

196
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,199
australian english i believe you

197
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,840
recognize this four-letter music band

198
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,199
and most of you

199
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,120
if we had the opportunity to be in a

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,919
live setup and have a show of hands you

201
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,599
would agree with me that this is acdc

202
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,160
to your surprise at least to those who

203
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,840
are not aware of this

204
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,720
for an australian it is straight obvious

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
that this

206
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,639
says akadaka

207
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,720
i know it's different

208
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
a second tell is the expression tastes

209
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,960
like butter

210
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
where the fluctuation speed spectrum

211
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
from the mother tongue in this case

212
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,960
involuntary puts extra emphasis to the

213
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,280
eye and the bar sound in the button

214
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
conscious of time i'm giving you just

215
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,720
the highlights of the different

216
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,680
identifiers i really wish we were in

217
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
person to go through this in a more

218
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,240
detail it would be a lot of fun to study

219
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,080
these identifiers so let's move on

220
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,440
to hindi

221
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,919
again forget action i know it is

222
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,440
difficult to suddenly make that

223
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,640
distinction

224
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
this was difficult identifier and it was

225
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,839
tested extensively at different parts of

226
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,279
the world

227
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,360
the word correct

228
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
is by far the biggest tell when said

229
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,720
it is always it always sounds like

230
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
correct

231
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,080
a white a followed by a short sudden

232
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,839
sound

233
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,399
a friend of mine is an american indian

234
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,880
second generation he speaks perfect

235
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,120
english that's the only word that

236
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
actually betrays if you were only to

237
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
hear him speaking and not if you were to

238
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,959
hear him on the phone that he has some

239
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,640
indian background

240
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,000
moving on

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
to a very special example apparently

242
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
this word makes a huge difference

243
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
between the way it is pronounced based

244
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,480
on the person's background and can even

245
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
help distinguish between spoken deutsch

246
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
from germany

247
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,360
especially the berlin area compared to

248
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
that's speaking deutsch in the

249
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,040
netherlands i know it can get a little

250
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,160
bit confusing

251
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,399
a shout out to chris rebecca for helping

252
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,800
me identifying this word it is very

253
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,040
difficult for me to say that

254
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,720
i don't want to even to attempt to say

255
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,200
it but this is a great great example as

256
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
far as i know in the test that we've

257
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,040
done until now we haven't seen an

258
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,320
example that is based on malapropism

259
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
an individual with arabic as their

260
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,560
mother tang from the region of palestine

261
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
tends to read and pronounce bruce lee in

262
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,519
the heat of their conversation as abu

263
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,920
rasili they say it wrong

264
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
now how you end up incorporating this

265
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,560
identifier in your conversations it is

266
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,240
up to you and your imaginations

267
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,360
obviously

268
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
i chose a couple of examples that are

269
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
based on arabic as the mother tongue

270
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,120
simply because even among arabs

271
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,680
and arabic speakers tends to be very

272
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,320
difficult to distinguish sometimes and i

273
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
saw it as a very interesting challenge

274
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,800
in this case for example distinguishing

275
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,040
between the extremely similar regional

276
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,920
influences in the speed spectrum between

277
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,839
jordan and palestine

278
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,320
palestinians use and know how to

279
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,279
pronounce the word salame for example

280
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,839
that is a very interesting identifier

281
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,720
and a shout out to dina nassar for

282
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,000
helping identifying this world

283
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,680
we couldn't leave the french out of our

284
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,959
brief example

285
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,800
i have actually included a number of

286
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,920
words here but the most interesting one

287
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
which can also lead you in funny

288
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,440
uncomfortable situations i would say is

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
the word focus

290
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
as we need to keep this session pg

291
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
let's just mention that this word ends

292
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,640
up with a more distinctive

293
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,120
sound instead of phone

294
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
i believe this is where people do this

295
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
wink wink gesture right

296
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,959
anyhow

297
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,480
you see this is why sign language is

298
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,440
more clear in what you mean in this type

299
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,600
of situations and you couldn't be able

300
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,360
to apply this model

301
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
here's a fun fact for you before we move

302
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
on

303
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,160
every language

304
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
travel at the speed of sound

305
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,320
sign language travels at the speed of

306
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,279
light

307
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,600
i kept greek for last despite the fact

308
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
it would be interesting to spend more

309
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,920
time to go through the greek identifiers

310
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,519
which some of them can be seen in the

311
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,000
slide i wanted to cheer you up a bit

312
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
before moving into closing the

313
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
presentation

314
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
i'm sure most of you have heard of the

315
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,279
comedian zach galicianakis

316
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,079
his last name can act as an identifier

317
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
for the same reasons the word heroes is

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
very distinctive as identified

319
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,800
for those of you who are not familiar

320
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
with euros

321
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
think of it as the

322
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
almost national food in greece

323
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,120
more specifically pronouncing the

324
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,639
distinctive

325
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,519
sound

326
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,519
is a special identifier

327
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,639
so special that there is even a song

328
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,079
about it

329
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,480
jimmy fallon and luke bryan did a whole

330
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,639
sketch about this word

331
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,320
so for you to quickly enjoy

332
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,279
europe

333
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,000
we could safely rule that last one out

334
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,320
how would you pronounce it then

335
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,560
you know

336
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,409
[Applause]

337
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,979
[Music]

338
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,630
i finally got some peace of mind

339
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,040
[Music]

340
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,760
we finally got some peace of mind

341
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,399
it is gyro

342
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
and it is even more delicious to

343
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,120
actually try it

344
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
closing this hopefully tasteful

345
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,800
presentation here is a github link to

346
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,959
look through the different identifiers i

347
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,519
have listed and some further reading i

348
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,360
did in order to understand how to

349
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,079
approach and organize the observations i

350
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,959
was coming across

351
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,040
maybe with some more contributions

352
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,279
trials and errors we can come up in the

353
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,880
future with a type of pan-phonic poem

354
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,440
similar to the voice synthesizer pangram

355
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
in mission impossible movies

356
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,720
that once one reads it you can use it to

357
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,600
make certain detections and potentially

358
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,519
use it in human intelligence gathering

359
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,800
thank you all for your time and

360
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
attentions and don't hesitate to reach

361
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
out to me or drop me a line

362
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
i will be sharing the presentations pile

363
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,120
on my twitter account which includes our

364
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
appendix about the famous cognitive test

365
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
that uses simple sentences such as noise

366
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,160
ends or bugs

367
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,639
test yourself on how many times you can

368
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,360
repeatedly say this sentence out loud

369
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,680
without making a mistake thank you all

370
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,680
enjoy the rest of the conference
