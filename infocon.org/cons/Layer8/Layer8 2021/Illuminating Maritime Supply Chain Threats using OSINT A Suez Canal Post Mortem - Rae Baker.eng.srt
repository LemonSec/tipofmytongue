1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,799
hi thanks for having me i am super

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,800
excited to be speaking today

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,280
uh my name is ray baker wundersmith

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,160
underscore ray on twitter and this is my

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,480
second larry talk

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
larry has a special place in my heart

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,760
because it is where i started in ocean

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,640
i

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
i went to a layer eight

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,359
conference about two years ago and then

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,960
i spoke at the next year and now this is

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,160
the

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,320
following year so

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
my talk today is illuminating maritime

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,800
supply chain threats a suez canal

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,559
post-mortem so what i plan to do is run

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,520
through a timeline of events um

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
surrounding the ever given incident in

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
the suez canal

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
um

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,840
various associated threats to the supply

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,399
chain and

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,199
how we as ocean analysts can investigate

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,000
and

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
potentially predict these

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,799
sorts of events

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,840
i have been in ocean like i said for

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,920
about two to three years now

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
i work as a senior cyber recon analyst

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,240
i also have the pleasure of being

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,560
involved in a few uh ocean related

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
non-profits

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,720
that are super important to me and the

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,479
community

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,360
uh

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,439
ocean curious and that is a a group

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
where we bring ocean to the community

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
and we present ocean topics for free and

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,479
in the form of blogs and videos and

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,960
uh used to be in person events but

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,119
hopefully we get back to that

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,920
uh also the innocent lives foundation

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,399
where i volunteer in the

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,360
fight against child exploitation

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
and operation safe escape where i assist

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
domestic violence victims and help them

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
escape from their abusers

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,040
so

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,439
additionally and more relevant to this

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,840
specific talk

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,639
is uh

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,000
i have a very deep love for maritime

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
related ocean

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
i kind of fell into it i wrote a blog

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,599
and

56
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,760
people seem to like it and it kind of

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,160
snowballed from there and now i focus

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,440
personally

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,319
on

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,440
mostly ocean topics relating to maritime

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,360
so let's jump right into it

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,760
um the first thing we need to know

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,519
when we're talking about the subas canal

64
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,480
is where is the suez canal

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,959
uh so the suez canal is a it's a

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,720
man-made waterway

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,239
in egypt and it connects the

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,760
mediterranean sea to the red sea

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,959
so the purpose of the suez canal is that

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,959
it reduces the amount of time that it

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,440
takes a ship to travel from asia

72
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
to europe by about 10 days

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
so it's a really important route for

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
moving goods because

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,319
about 12 of the world's

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,840
trade

77
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
passes through the canal each year

78
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,800
um so if it had to take that extra 10

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
days and go around

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
asia or yeah

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,360
around

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
africa

83
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,480
it would cost a lot more money

84
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,840
additionally passing through the

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,120
canal uh

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,920
costs the the ship owners

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,040
um

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
hundreds of thousands of dollars in

89
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,080
tolls

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
so that's really good for the local

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
economy

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,400
so the suez canal is pretty important

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
um

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,239
for both trade and the local economy

95
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,840
um

96
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,040
so

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,519
there are some ocean sources that we are

98
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
able to use when we're looking into

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,720
things like ports and waterways and

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,200
vessels

101
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,239
and this this talk is kind of a mix of

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,400
a maritime ocean and a timeline so i'm

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,238
going to try and stick in some ocean

104
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,358
things here

105
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,399
um so one of the things that you can do

106
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
uh to get details about ports

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440
like the suic or the waterway like the

108
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,600
suez canal or ports

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
we can use things like marine traffic or

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
vessel finder

111
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
for things like live

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,919
[Music]

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,120
live tracking maps so in the the bottom

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
right here you can see that that's a

115
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
live map showing

116
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,680
uh ships waiting

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,400
on each side of the suez canal and going

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
through it and that's a live map and you

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
can pull it up for free and you can you

120
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,320
can look at that

121
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,560
and get the details about the ships that

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
are moving

123
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,440
um also on sites like marine traffic um

124
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,080
you can go to

125
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
you can do a search for like suez canal

126
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,520
and it will give you details like

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,680
um all the vessels that are in there

128
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,020
currently um

129
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,160
[Music]

130
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
you know companies if it's if it's a

131
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,400
port versus a waterway

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,199
uh you can get information about the

133
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,880
companies that are at a port if you've

134
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,560
never been to a port they're they're

135
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,919
huge they're like a

136
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,240
city basically it's just a lot of

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
companies

138
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
um and if you're looking into a vessel

139
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,639
most likely you'll want to know who owns

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,039
it and who

141
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,280
usually it's several people who own it

142
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,080
or do work on it or

143
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,479
run it

144
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,680
and you can find some of that

145
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,800
information through marine traffic

146
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
another good

147
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,520
uh thing that i use often is uh

148
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
photos taken by ship spotters

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,120
um

150
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,840
so

151
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,720
there are people who just really enjoy

152
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,919
taking pictures of ships so they will

153
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,160
sit at if they live near a port they

154
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,759
will sit there and they will take

155
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
pictures of the ships coming and going

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
and they'll post them

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
i know there are some people on twitter

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
who do this um

159
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
they live near a specific port and they

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
just post

161
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,479
all the warships or whatever that are

162
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,840
going through

163
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
that are notable and that's great from

164
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
an ocean perspective because you get a

165
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
constant

166
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
feed of

167
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,120
things that are going in that port

168
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,800
um another thing i use often are port

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
cameras

170
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
and

171
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,759
these can be found uh through a simple

172
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,240
google search

173
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
you can search for

174
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,160
you know port camera in

175
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,840
la um these pictures here i

176
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,560
i i did exactly that i did a google

177
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
search port camera in la and poor camera

178
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
and um

179
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,479
i think that's miami

180
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,759
so

181
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,240
there's tons of poor cameras it's hit or

182
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,319
miss whether they actually like if

183
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,520
you're looking for a specific port

184
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,599
whether it has a camera but definitely

185
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,960
google it

186
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,720
um

187
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,120
this one down here uh in the bottom is

188
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,400
rotterdam

189
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
and rotterdam is

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
they helped us out a little bit because

191
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,039
they have a website

192
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,759
for the port and on the website they

193
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,880
show us the locations of all the cameras

194
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
and you can click on them on the map

195
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
and so if you know you're looking for

196
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,599
ships that are either at port in a

197
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,400
certain place or coming in in a certain

198
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
direction you can kind of pick and

199
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,520
choose what you want to look at

200
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,280
another thing that i use often is this

201
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,280
cruising.com

202
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,199
and it kind of does the same thing it

203
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,520
has a bunch of poor cameras but one of

204
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,599
the things that i thought was pretty

205
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,360
cool is they have a

206
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
cruise line section so you can

207
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
go in you can find the cruise line that

208
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,599
you want to look for and then you can

209
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
select this specific ship and you can

210
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,720
see if there's a port camera

211
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,440
on the ship front back side whatever

212
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,879
they offer

213
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,319
so that could be a way if you know

214
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,919
there's a cruise ship near another ship

215
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,360
that you want to see or there's a cruise

216
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,319
ship in a location that you're trying to

217
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
to see

218
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,879
you can maybe use a cruise ship to

219
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,840
to get a better view

220
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,599
um

221
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,399
like i said another

222
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
source a very large source

223
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,399
that i personally use is social media

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,160
and

225
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,760
mostly twitter

226
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,640
there are analysts who

227
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,279
whether they're journalists or just a

228
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,760
maritime analyst or maybe they

229
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,120
um

230
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,640
just want to get information out like

231
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
they're in

232
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,279
china or you know the pacific and they

233
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,720
feel like the information needs to get

234
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
out there

235
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,480
about what's happening so they'll post

236
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,160
constant updates and a lot of them have

237
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,480
satellite information

238
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
so

239
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
they

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,680
will you don't necessarily need to have

241
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,920
a satellite

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,040
service or subscription because

243
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
you know if you follow them on here you

244
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
can

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
use their satellite

246
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,080
so they'll post different

247
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,800
pictures and they'll show you know an

248
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,920
overhead shot of a ship in a port or

249
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,040
measurement somehow how big the ship is

250
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
where it's located and then maybe some

251
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,680
context about what's going on

252
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,000
definitely don't take it all at face

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,800
values um some people

254
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,959
post things with

255
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,680
their own personal

256
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,920
uh context added

257
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,240
that's not necessarily true

258
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,920
so you can use what you see as a guide

259
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
to kind of dig deeper into what's

260
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,760
happening

261
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
um

262
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,399
so here's just a few examples of

263
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,079
tracking the queen elizabeth which was a

264
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,880
huge um you know convoy of ships um

265
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,760
the

266
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,600
in the carrier strike group in the

267
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,040
pacific

268
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
um and then just some satellite pictures

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
of you know chinese ships and u.s ships

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,120
and

271
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,240
um one for illegal fishing

272
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
and then tanker trackers is another good

273
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,839
one that if you're into like oil

274
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,040
tracking

275
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,480
um

276
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,640
they give lots of updates and ship

277
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,839
numbers and stuff like that

278
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,519
so why should you

279
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,000
care about the suez canal

280
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
um

281
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,880
well you buy things so

282
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
that is probably the most important

283
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
reason that you should care

284
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,279
is because so much of what you purchase

285
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,920
uh traverses the suez canal so you gotta

286
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,000
think how much you're buying from china

287
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,120
or

288
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
you know other countries that need to go

289
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
through the subus canal to get you your

290
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,320
goods

291
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
um

292
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,880
the area

293
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
or you know all these kind of waterways

294
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,560
and canals are tend to be highly

295
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,079
political

296
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,920
because there's lots of money to be made

297
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,959
from

298
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,360
you know the tolls and

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
the money that's saved by going through

300
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,560
them

301
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,079
um cutting costs

302
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,640
so it tends to be interesting to follow

303
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,880
because there's a high geopolitical

304
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,600
interest in these things so people will

305
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
fight over them they'll

306
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,160
you know argue they'll you know

307
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,240
post things so it's kind of interesting

308
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,440
to follow it

309
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
from that aspect

310
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
um

311
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,040
and another thing it's just fun um

312
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,920
i i mean i'm a nerd i guess i

313
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,639
i think it's fun to watch the position

314
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,120
of the ships what's going on

315
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,200
where they're going who they're talking

316
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,720
to what they say they're doing

317
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
i

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,360
just find that really interesting

319
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,600
so

320
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,040
now let's get into what happened in the

321
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,839
2021 suez canal event so i'm sure

322
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
i'll be surprised if you have not heard

323
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,320
of this event because it was everywhere

324
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,600
um

325
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
but we're gonna go through the timeline

326
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,000
of the event

327
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,120
so first

328
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,600
uh the ship we're talking about is the

329
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,320
ever given it is a container ship uh

330
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,959
chartered and operated by evergreen

331
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
marine in taiwan

332
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,680
it's one of the largest container ships

333
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
in the world

334
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,160
at

335
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
400 meters long

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,920
and

337
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,839
219 tons

338
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,120
so it's pretty big going through the

339
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,399
canal

340
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,160
um it's actually

341
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,120
uh

342
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
roughly the same size as the empire

343
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,279
state building

344
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,880
and it's six feet tall it's about 218

345
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,200
nicholas cages stacked on top of each

346
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
other

347
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,000
so

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,279
when ships go through the canal

349
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,480
they are not piloted by their captains

350
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,120
they're piloted by canal pilots so when

351
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,880
they pull into the canal

352
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,600
canal pilots get on the ship and they

353
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,399
pilot it through the canal

354
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
so on march 23rd two canal pilots board

355
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,800
the ever given and they start traveling

356
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,560
through the suez canal

357
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,120
and their destination is

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,320
well the ship's destination is rotterdam

359
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
so while they're going through the canal

360
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,000
there's um it's not really a storm i

361
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,920
think there was just strong winds but it

362
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,959
pushed the ever given a little bit and

363
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,360
it started turning sideways and it ran

364
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
aground

365
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,360
so after trying

366
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,920
unsuccessfully to get the ship unstuck

367
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,360
uh they called seven tugboats in

368
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,399
um

369
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,880
and i think you can see a few on this

370
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,240
yeah this

371
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,560
screenshot from marine traffic

372
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,880
um they were unsuccessful they didn't

373
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
have any luck pulling it out

374
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,079
um i know

375
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,000
that this picture is kind of hard to see

376
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,480
what the ship looked like um so i have a

377
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
zoomed in picture for you

378
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,199
so i hope that helps

379
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,199
um see what the ever given look like

380
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,040
uh as the african continues to clog the

381
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,000
canal

382
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,560
uh you can see the ships backing up on

383
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,839
either side

384
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,760
um

385
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,440
and we can again follow this on

386
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,639
something like

387
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,760
vessel finder or marine traffic to track

388
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
this and

389
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,440
this becomes a problem because all these

390
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,000
ships you know they're on

391
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,519
on a schedule they have to get through

392
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,279
so they're all backed up on each side

393
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,800
and they they don't know what to do

394
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,199
so

395
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,600
march 24th

396
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,399
so now they are getting desperate

397
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,320
they call in a dredger

398
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
and a larger tug and smith salvage comes

399
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,440
and they arrive on the scene and they

400
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,199
have a plan and they're going to dredge

401
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,399
the sand out from underneath the boat

402
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,519
and

403
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,519
allow it to float free

404
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,839
sounds great right

405
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,279
so this little

406
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,320
excavator is or dredger whatever they

407
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,759
call it is digging out sand from under

408
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,680
this giant ship

409
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,399
um at this point this the suez canal

410
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,199
authority announces that all movement

411
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,600
has been suspended until the ship is

412
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,240
refloated

413
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,199
march 26th

414
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:07,959
now

415
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:10,320
237 ships are

416
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,120
waiting to go through the canal

417
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,959
as you can see them all lined up here in

418
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,639
this picture

419
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,440
uh the rudder and propellers have been

420
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,839
freed

421
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,959
um but

422
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,880
fleas of ships are starting to make the

423
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,560
long journey

424
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,440
uh

425
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,720
diverting around africa through the cape

426
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,120
of good hope

427
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,440
was diverting the best option

428
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,399
um

429
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,800
going through the cape of good hope had

430
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
several travel days and probably

431
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,399
millions of dollars

432
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,560
luckily or

433
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,880
interestingly diverting was not really

434
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,360
the trend among all the ships that were

435
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,399
waiting

436
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,199
um because of the financial strain to go

437
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,279
or all the way around and add all those

438
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,880
days

439
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,799
um

440
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,000
even though armed guards on these ships

441
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
um

442
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,799
who normally go through that area

443
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,319
uh have slowed piracy it's still a less

444
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,880
desirable option in an emergency

445
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
situation like

446
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,480
like this

447
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,319
and if they don't normally go around

448
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,480
there they wouldn't have armed guards on

449
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,960
the vessel so it could

450
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,280
mean a loss of

451
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,200
their cargo or even lives

452
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,360
so going around can be risky

453
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,840
you can track things like piracy

454
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,360
the commercial crime services has this

455
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,720
website

456
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,200
where you can go on and it shows you

457
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
these little flags

458
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,720
of where piracy events have happened

459
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,960
so you can pick an area on

460
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,559
the map and you can see

461
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,640
they're color-coded by like attempted

462
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,919
attack fired upon hijacked

463
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,840
and if you click on them it gives you

464
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,280
more details about what has happened so

465
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,799
you know

466
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,120
this one crew on board a drifting tanker

467
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,880
noticed a mother vessel launching a

468
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
skiff with four persons which approached

469
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
at a high speed

470
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,039
uh raised the alarm increased speed took

471
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,520
evasive maneuvers um

472
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,240
skiff managed to come alongside

473
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,400
boarding was avoided so

474
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,559
they give you a fair amount of detail

475
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,320
about the event

476
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,280
um

477
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,880
so that can be interesting sometimes i

478
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,240
just check it for fun

479
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,000
just to see what's kind of going on

480
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,710
could we have seen this coming

481
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,919
[Music]

482
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,520
so

483
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,360
there are things like

484
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,559
choke points um and the suez canal being

485
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,320
one of them um

486
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,520
choke points around the world where lots

487
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
of shipping

488
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,600
uh traverses shipping lanes that might

489
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
be

490
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,230
important politically

491
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,640
[Music]

492
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
that we could use

493
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,360
to kind of guess whether

494
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,760
something might happen there we can use

495
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,960
past history of issues for a shipping

496
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,559
line or a specific area

497
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,080
basically the past should inform the

498
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,039
future

499
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,080
about what can happen

500
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,200
and using osan we can kind of

501
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,240
uh estimate things that would happen

502
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
um or at least

503
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
keep um

504
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,799
in the know when we monitor these types

505
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,840
of situations

506
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,120
also this

507
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
photo is

508
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,679
i think hilarious but it's the the

509
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
shipping path that they ever given took

510
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,400
before it went into the suez canal so

511
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,440
uh

512
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,720
decipher that as you may

513
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,559
so now we're at march 27th

514
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,960
um now

515
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,120
276 ships are waiting to go through the

516
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,880
canal

517
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
they were hoping for conditions to

518
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,720
improve nothing really changed

519
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,080
uh march 28th

520
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,400
327 ships are now waiting they call in a

521
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,799
specialty tug from the netherlands and a

522
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,799
dredger from cyprus

523
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,320
um they have moved 27 000 cubic meters

524
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,919
of sand

525
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,200
so

526
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,520
that's a lot of sand um not enough to

527
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,480
move

528
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,280
a giant chip

529
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
meanwhile

530
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
while this was all going on um

531
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,039
russia took this opportunity to

532
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,640
talk about the northern sea route

533
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,679
so the northern sea route is not really

534
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,400
a new thing um i mean i guess it's kind

535
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,720
of new but it's not new to talk about

536
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,640
it runs from the bering sea near the

537
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
russia norway border

538
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,240
to the bering strait uh between siberia

539
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,000
and alaska

540
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,880
so it's very important to russia

541
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,360
because it could become

542
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
a route to transport things and extract

543
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
resources

544
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
from the arctic

545
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,679
and it's shorter by about 4 000 miles

546
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,200
from south korea to england

547
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,360
it's 4000 miles shorter than the suez

548
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,840
canal

549
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,400
so if it's shortening that whole

550
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,280
trip

551
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,440
it could be a huge boost to the uh

552
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,120
russian economy

553
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,480
obviously

554
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,039
and in 2020 uh

555
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,960
putin released a document on how they

556
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,480
plan to develop the russian arctic zone

557
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,320
is what they call it

558
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
including constructing ports and

559
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,880
creating nuclear icebreaking ships

560
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,400
there are some

561
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,640
heavy environmental concerns with

562
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,240
increased shipping

563
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
in that area

564
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,559
like oil spills and pollution

565
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,679
um

566
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,640
because of all the ice and the wildlife

567
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,520
and heavy fuel oil

568
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,840
produces black carbon and that

569
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,600
accelerates the ice melting rate so

570
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,080
very concerned about this

571
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,880
russia is currently building things i

572
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,640
know they're working on ports and

573
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,120
i i do monitor things that are happening

574
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,679
around there so i know that they are

575
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,760
traversing their nuclear icebreaking

576
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,320
ships through the area and they want to

577
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,799
promote this as an alternative to the

578
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,840
suez canal

579
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,120
so now it's march 29th

580
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,200
there are

581
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,280
367 ships currently waiting to go

582
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,600
through the suez canal

583
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
but

584
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
the ship is now free

585
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,240
the ship is sent to great bitter lake uh

586
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,919
for inspection

587
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,679
so 37 ships go through the canal but

588
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,520
they say it should take about a week to

589
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
clear

590
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,000
uh all of them

591
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,559
so moving to march 30th there are now

592
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,520
less ships 352 ships are waiting so they

593
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,799
are going through

594
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,840
um slowly but it is thinning out

595
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,559
on april 1st there are 259 ships waiting

596
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
again still going through

597
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,960
until the ship owner declares general

598
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,880
average

599
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,159
the law of general average is

600
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,000
it's an old-time

601
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,520
maritime law that says

602
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
uh

603
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,000
it's essentially that

604
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,799
every company that has cargo on board

605
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,880
has money in the

606
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,799
invested in the ship uh cargo

607
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,559
they're legally responsible for the

608
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,039
cargo

609
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,080
and they will split the cost to save the

610
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,880
whole

611
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,200
so basically they're all on the hook for

612
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
some of the money to get the ship

613
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,559
unstuck

614
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,760
which is a lot of money

615
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,679
um so

616
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,600
now the ship is unstuck so we should be

617
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,120
good right

618
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,039
no not at all

619
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,200
um according to the lloyd's list's

620
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,360
estimate the waiting costs caused by the

621
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,480
incident

622
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,000
uh were about 9.6 billion dollars per

623
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,360
day

624
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,640
um

625
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,159
that's a lot

626
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,520
also it delayed a maersk

627
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,600
causing congestion at their terminals i

628
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,440
mean that that's a huge shipping company

629
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,400
so

630
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,120
um shipyards bottlenecks up through the

631
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,880
logistics chain

632
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,279
um

633
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,159
you know the one-week blockage

634
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,679
caused

635
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,960
a loss in capacity and forced mares to

636
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,120
play catch-up

637
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
u.s manufacturing that relies on

638
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,158
components that produce in other areas

639
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,400
are also being touched and we know now

640
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
they they were were still backed up the

641
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,799
port of los angeles is

642
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,360
very backed up

643
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,880
and then there's something called supply

644
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,799
chain contagion which is when things are

645
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,640
manufactured in

646
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
the u.s they'll take spare parts from

647
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,919
europe and vice versa so it's the idea

648
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,559
that an effect in one place very quickly

649
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,158
impacts another place

650
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,200
so even though it's unstuck it the

651
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
ripple effect

652
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
is felt

653
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,640
across the board

654
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,000
on april 13th egypt decides to arrest

655
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
the ever given it holds it hostage and

656
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,559
it asks for 900 million dollars

657
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,480
so that is 900 million dollars that

658
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,400
everyone who owns

659
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,559
or holds cargo on that ship would have

660
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,159
to split

661
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,600
um they don't really want to do that

662
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
they argue it

663
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,559
on may 9th egypt opts to

664
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,919
cut it from 900 million to 600 million

665
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
which is a good deal i would probably

666
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,400
take that

667
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,760
july 29th the ever given finally pulls

668
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,279
into rotterdam

669
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,320
its final destination

670
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,880
and this t-rex finally arrives at the

671
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,559
golf center that it

672
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,279
had been trying to get to for quite a

673
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,520
while

674
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,039
uh so more bad actors are using cyber

675
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,919
threats as a way to attack

676
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,640
um u.s supply chain interests

677
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,520
um

678
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,559
using

679
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,960
shoddan you can pick up satellite like

680
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,279
the ship's satellite systems

681
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,720
ransomware's being used hacking

682
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
so it's a pretty important

683
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,440
part of our lives because of all the

684
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,600
stuff we buy the the supply chain is

685
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,679
very important and i think often it's

686
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,919
overlooked from a shipping

687
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,200
perspective until something bad happens

688
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,000
so as ocean analysts we can

689
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,159
you know keep an eye on things that we

690
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,039
see

691
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,159
going on

692
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,240
uh we talked about choke points before

693
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,120
so again those are highly important um

694
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,840
as a consideration for supply chain um

695
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,559
these are all heavily political

696
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
and and not only that they could be a

697
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,440
potential national security issue um if

698
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
you think you know over in the pacific

699
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,919
if they shut down

700
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,399
access to the straits

701
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,320
um you know you might not be able to get

702
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
anything from china and

703
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,720
i mean if we're honest how much uh have

704
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,240
you bought from amazon that has come

705
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,600
from china

706
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,600
so you you don't want that shut down

707
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
um also

708
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,399
the average

709
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,520
end-to-end container shipment so from

710
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,120
start to finish

711
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,919
involves 30 organizations

712
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,679
over 100 people

713
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,360
and over 200 information exchanges

714
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,840
so

715
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,440
the rough part about that is that

716
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,240
all that information is being moved

717
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,279
but with terrible processes generally

718
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,360
this is critical information so this is

719
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,200
bills of lading packing lists invoices

720
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,080
but it's done in a massive mess of like

721
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,120
email and papers and faxes and excel

722
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,399
spreadsheets

723
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,000
so it tends to break processes and

724
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,640
sometimes cause more severe issues

725
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,120
uh because it is so broken

726
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
so

727
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,320
how can we as ocean analysts provide

728
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,480
actionable intelligence

729
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,840
[Music]

730
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,320
that could prevent a container ship like

731
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,559
they ever given from

732
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,559
being in the similar fate

733
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,360
uh

734
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,919
so just to recap we can

735
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,399
you know we can follow social media

736
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,360
see what's going on um see if anybody's

737
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,919
talking about anything uh look at past

738
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,080
experiences has

739
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,159
you know used situations like they ever

740
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,520
given to

741
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,799
um

742
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,799
create a plan for the future like don't

743
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,600
wait for something to happen to

744
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
to think that it might

745
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,640
um

746
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
you know it's just like ransomware and

747
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,039
you have to prepare for it um just in

748
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,880
case it happens

749
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,240
uh we can track on live maps uh we can

750
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,720
look at ship spawning sites

751
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
we can

752
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,159
look for photos

753
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,290
satellite imagery

754
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,919
[Music]

755
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,360
and

756
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,399
just generally i think

757
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,600
we can stay aware of

758
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,279
again the past should inform the future

759
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,240
um and and just be aware how important

760
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,720
the supply chain is and how important

761
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,919
these choke points are

762
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,480
when a ship is going through them or

763
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,919
like what is happening politically

764
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,559
so basically that is my presentation i

765
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,600
hope that you enjoyed it and i hope that

766
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,360
i have

767
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,479
made you like ships

768
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,520
and if you like ship content you can

769
