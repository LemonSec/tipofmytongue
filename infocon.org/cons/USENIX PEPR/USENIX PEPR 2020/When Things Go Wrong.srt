1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,000
so hi

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,759
i'm leah kistner and i'm here to talk to

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,080
you today about when things go wrong

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,839
now just to give you an idea of where

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,199
i'm coming from on this

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,439
i spent nearly a dozen years at google

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,359
uh working on security and privacy and

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,800
i'm not going to name incidents

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,199
but let's just say i've worked a few in

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,080
my day

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,599
after i left there i went to huma where

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,279
i was the chief privacy officer

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,720
one of the first things i did there was

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,640
rewrite the incident procedures

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,120
and then i had to zoom for a few months

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,640
in the wake of their

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,640
public and exciting security privacy

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,719
issues to try and help them

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,960
so i worked emergencies at small

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,640
medium and large companies i wanted to

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,840
share with you some of the things that

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,160
i've

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,079
learned in the hopes that they'll help

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,680
to help you because

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,840
as people who specialize in when things

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,920
go wrong on the internet

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,239
we didn't need 2020 to tell us that bad

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,199
things happen

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,079
so let's talk about when things go wrong

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,760
now i'm going to share with you at the

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,400
end

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,320
uh a cheat sheet for this something

33
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,920
which you can use as an incident

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,360
response document yourself

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,119
actually uh this is the one that i wrote

36
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,200
for humus courtesy of humu

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
and uh our auditors there

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,240
they told us it's the best they've ever

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,600
seen so it's

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,880
might be a good starting point for you

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
and actually writing things down that is

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
in fact my first tip

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,680
because it turns out that you should

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
plan for panic

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
your adrenal system in these cases is

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,799
going to be very activated

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,159
you're probably familiar with the

48
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,759
physical effects pounding heart

49
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,280
trembling things like that

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,759
but there are also cognitive effects you

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,520
are likely to interpret things as overly

52
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,320
negative

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,960
feel rushed and overall your capacity to

54
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,159
make good decisions

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,880
is sharply reduced this is ironic

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
because this is exactly when you care

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,799
about making good decisions quickly

58
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
so you should plan ahead have written

59
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,640
procedures and playbooks

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,439
consider your hard choices when you have

61
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,240
the leisure

62
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,119
and the relaxation to do that in advance

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,880
you can also use some physiological

64
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,598
hacks when i'm in an incident and people

65
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,800
are starting to ramp up

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,959
i will have everyone stop for a moment

67
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,000
and breathe

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
deeply um breathe in your nose breathe

69
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
out your mouth it is a physiological

70
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,800
hack

71
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,120
that resets your nervous system which

72
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,319
makes you

73
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,599
be in a place to make better decisions

74
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,120
so let's go through the steps of

75
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
handling an incident before you even

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,920
start

77
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,519
assign the incident commander to

78
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,840
coordinate and manage

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,239
operations if you don't do this even at

80
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,440
a small company

81
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
you are likely to get some chaos pretty

82
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,480
fast

83
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,959
first step though find the cut what's

84
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,480
going wrong who's affected

85
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,720
is this an incident a vulnerability or a

86
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,080
false positive

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
then you should start stop the bleeding

88
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,160
stop the bad thing from going wrong

89
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
it doesn't necessarily mean fixing it it

90
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
means stopping it

91
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
and then you can clean up the blood fix

92
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
whatever's broken

93
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
make sure you understand the root cause

94
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
or causes and then put in place

95
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
longer term measures to avoid a repeat

96
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
now this is not

97
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,959
standard terminology this is the

98
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,480
terminology i use because people

99
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,280
actually remember it in an emergency

100
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
so let's talk about step zero assigning

101
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
a commander

102
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
this person is going to manage your

103
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,080
coordination and operations they are not

104
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,680
the same person as the one doing the

105
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
debugging there's a reason for this

106
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
you're debugging you need to be heads

107
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
down you need to be concentrating

108
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
if you're doing the incident commander

109
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,879
role you need to have your heads up

110
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,640
you're doing a lot of communication

111
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
you're doing a lot of coordination and

112
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
you're also making sure things are

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
written down

114
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
this is partially because when people

115
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,120
are doing the debugging and they're

116
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,760
kind of panic they are likely to try the

117
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,720
same thing

118
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,519
or the same fix over and over again the

119
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,360
incident commander is there to try and

120
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,879
interrupt that cycle

121
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,159
but also we're going to need that

122
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,560
written record for later

123
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,480
now another thing about an incident

124
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,319
commanders there can be only one it is

125
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
like highlander

126
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
there need to be explicit handoffs so if

127
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,959
alice is

128
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,519
is handing off the role to bob alice

129
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,720
says

130
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
bob you're the incident commander and

131
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
bob says i am the incident commander

132
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,599
you don't want to have this fall in the

133
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,200
crack so nobody is the incident

134
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,319
commander

135
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,760
then make sure that everybody else knows

136
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,759
who the incident commander is name them

137
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,279
in a coordination location

138
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,120
the document you're using the slack

139
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
channel wherever

140
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,360
you should also consider a jaunty hat

141
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,400
this hat

142
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,120
was part of the humu uh incident

143
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
handling procedures

144
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
and the reason why uh is partially

145
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,759
because then everybody knows that

146
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,600
there's an incident since

147
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,040
we were all in the office back in the

148
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,639
day and then

149
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,720
also people know who to go talk to about

150
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,919
that incident

151
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,240
the other one is particularly relevant

152
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,759
for those of us who have handled a lot

153
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
of incidents

154
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,199
if you are the one handling a lot of

155
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,720
incidents people start getting really

156
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
scared when you walk up to them because

157
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
they're like oh no it might be a

158
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,000
terrible

159
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,880
thing again that's not really useful for

160
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,560
doing the rest of your job and honestly

161
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,759
it's not much fun

162
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,560
so if you use something that's a very

163
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
explicit sign that you're handling an

164
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
incident versus not

165
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,680
then people get scared of the hat and

166
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,000
not scared of you

167
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
so let's move on to finding the cut so

168
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
we're going to ask ourselves some

169
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,919
questions

170
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,000
what's going wrong is anything going

171
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,759
wrong is this a false positive

172
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,479
and keep in mind it is very good if

173
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,080
you're finding false positives

174
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
there's a few reasons for this the first

175
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
one is that well there's nothing wrong

176
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,720
but the second one is that if you're not

177
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
seeing false positives

178
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,240
you are almost certainly not seeing all

179
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,600
of the true positives

180
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,080
and you're probably missing things you

181
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
want to also ask yourself who is

182
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,080
affected

183
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
how many people what characteristics do

184
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
they have are they maybe different kinds

185
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
of users like admins employees

186
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
end users are they coming from a certain

187
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
geographic region a certain customer

188
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,039
other characteristics

189
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,639
so for example when google had the

190
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,320
problem where it labeled

191
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,479
pictures of some black people as apes

192
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,440
right a

193
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
not okay and b you need to understand

194
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,479
that you can't

195
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,400
debug issues like that on everybody you

196
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
need to know who is affected

197
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,919
then you want to look at whether it's an

198
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,000
incident or vulnerability a lot of

199
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,840
people use these terms interchangeably

200
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
they are not interchangeable a

201
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
vulnerability is a flaw in your systems

202
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,120
or procedures

203
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,440
which could allow a bad thing to happen

204
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,240
an incident

205
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
is when the bad thing actually happens

206
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
the remediation is different for these

207
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,479
in a remediation for an incident you

208
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,000
need to take care of the people who have

209
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
been affected by the incident

210
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
also your legal obligations are probably

211
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,160
different you probably have to report

212
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
to the local data protection authority

213
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
uh maybe your users

214
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,840
so i'm going to talk about a couple of

215
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,680
things which cause incidents here

216
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
uh there's lots of them everybody's

217
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,039
stack is different but

218
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,080
these are particularly interesting or

219
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,479
easy to diagnose from the outside first

220
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,360
one is employee

221
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,319
errors especially when people are doing

222
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,080
privacy sensitive things manually they

223
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
are going to mess up they just

224
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,919
they're people and one of the things

225
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,720
that

226
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,639
is a problem that we can fall into is

227
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
believing that our remit

228
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,759
is the production system and we don't

229
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,280
remember that there's all of these other

230
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,440
things going on

231
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,240
privacy incidents can cover everything

232
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,479
not just your production systems

233
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,080
another case is when your user says well

234
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,319
i i told your product to do this thing

235
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,240
and then it did this other thing

236
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,800
well sometimes they just didn't read

237
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
sometimes they forgot

238
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
i have gotten so many incident repo

239
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,639
reports where somebody said well i

240
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,160
didn't turn on this feature

241
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,639
i didn't change to choose this setting

242
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,160
and i went back in the logs and i said

243
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,639
well

244
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
i see in here that it looks like you've

245
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
turned up this on

246
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,919
uh back last september and

247
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
uh on your mobile phone and they go

248
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,280
oh i totally did and they just forgot

249
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,199
now both of these things are technically

250
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,360
false positives but they are invaluable

251
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
to making your product work

252
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,560
because unless you are making some sort

253
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
of creepy horror game freaking out your

254
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
users is not the vibe you're going for

255
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,800
it's really valuable feedback sometimes

256
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
the users are right and your system is

257
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,639
broken uh one place that happens a lot

258
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,599
is consent

259
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,360
maybe you ask for the wrong consent

260
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
maybe you asked for different consents

261
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
in different areas of your

262
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
of your product somehow because the

263
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,680
strings got out of sync

264
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
maybe you were trying to roll it out and

265
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
you rolled it out in some places and not

266
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,840
others

267
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,599
maybe you updated the product without

268
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,440
updating the consent

269
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
or maybe you updated the consent and you

270
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
forgot about all the people who had

271
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,399
were already using the product

272
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,479
sometimes the system is just not

273
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,559
behaving how you want it to behave

274
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,839
so i'm going to talk about a couple of

275
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,479
different classes of bugs one of them is

276
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,880
the alice gets bob data

277
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,920
sometimes bugs there's a few common

278
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,959
causes for these

279
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,880
one of them is thread safety so we have

280
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,560
a thread inside the processor

281
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,279
alice's data is being handled by one

282
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,880
thread bob's data is being handled by

283
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
another thread and then nobody used a

284
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,839
lock

285
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
and they start colliding with each other

286
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,320
and somebody gets somebody else's data

287
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,959
cache collisions sometimes we want to go

288
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,519
and pull

289
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,279
something out of the database or results

290
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,880
of a computation and just store it in

291
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,600
memory

292
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
for the next time somebody asks well if

293
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,920
you don't don't label what's in that

294
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,399
cache

295
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,240
really well according to who's which

296
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,760
user it is

297
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,320
alice might get bob's data sometimes or

298
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,519
memory corruption

299
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,160
uh in the memory of the computer while

300
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,800
you're doing

301
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,440
some sort of computation maybe alice's

302
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
data gets written into bob's area or

303
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
bob's area

304
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
data gets written into where we expect

305
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,519
to have alice's data

306
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,480
that's bad another place is where

307
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,320
somebody says well this is a bug

308
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
but if you look at the actual behavior

309
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
that's taking place the behavior is

310
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,680
correct it's just being applied at the

311
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,880
wrong time

312
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
sometimes this is a logic error somebody

313
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,279
flipped a less than sign or something

314
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,240
but sometimes it's a protocol error so

315
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
for example you might have

316
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,160
a new version of a protocol rolling out

317
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
and it changes the behavior of some of

318
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,279
the fields

319
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,160
so for example you might have the client

320
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,880
saying

321
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,959
you should take this data and make sure

322
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,880
it is private and the server says yes i

323
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,920
will take this data

324
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
and publish it publicly on the internet

325
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,240
and both sides think they're fine

326
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
and it's not another one is a is a type

327
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,399
error

328
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,839
so the client says uh this is my time

329
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,760
stamp and the server's like this is my

330
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,800
user id and this does not go well either

331
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,519
another one is more of like a very

332
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,440
classic type error where the

333
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,079
client might say this is a list and the

334
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:32,959
server's like

335
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,959
i know how to deal with integers and

336
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,680
this does not this is very bad

337
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760
another case is your ml model doesn't do

338
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,279
what it's supposed to and honestly the

339
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,279
root cause here is that you're using ml

340
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,839
the reason why you use ml is because it

341
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,880
does things

342
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,000
that you didn't program it to do

343
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,240
just some of them are going to be bad a

344
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,680
lot of the time the fact that it's

345
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,519
doing a bad thing comes down to bad

346
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,720
signals you took

347
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,320
you took different parts of the world

348
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
and put them in the ml model and you put

349
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,120
the wrong parts in

350
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,959
or a biased data set that doesn't just

351
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,640
mean so i put white people in and i

352
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
forgot everybody else

353
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,079
sometimes it's very subtle stuff like

354
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,519
the background color

355
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
and it will start asking the ml model

356
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,920
will start spitting out weird things

357
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,360
because the ml model is not a human

358
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
brain

359
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,560
sometimes it's insufficient data

360
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,160
somebody goes and says

361
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
oh machine learning is fancy and i'm

362
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,360
going to use it

363
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
and i'm going to put this data in and

364
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,320
you're like that's not enough data to

365
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,279
make that work

366
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
but something comes out the other side

367
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,519
it just doesn't behave very well

368
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,000
you should be testing better you that's

369
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
how you deal with this sort of thing

370
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,200
right you look at your human-centric

371
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,320
threat model and you say

372
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,680
well what are all the things that could

373
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
hurt or offend

374
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,600
one of my users or somebody affected by

375
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
my system let's just run them all

376
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
through there and see what happens

377
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
if you're not taking pictures of poop

378
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
and putting them through your ml model

379
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,639
you're probably missing things

380
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,560
the next step is to stop the bleeding we

381
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
want to stop the bad thing from going

382
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,800
wrong

383
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,120
now this is not necessarily the same

384
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,600
thing as actually fixing the thing

385
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,279
right we just want to stop it at this

386
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,200
point so you should design your service

387
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
in advance for doing quick stops

388
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
uh taking down the service big red

389
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,399
button just

390
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,120
make it go away binary roll back maybe

391
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,000
the new version

392
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,639
of your system has a bug the old version

393
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,440
is fine

394
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
can you get from the new one to the old

395
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,639
one really fast

396
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
selective blocking of network requests

397
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,880
so you might say well

398
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,200
network i'm just gonna take all of these

399
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,720
network requests and just pretend they

400
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,839
don't exist for a while

401
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,279
that can be a little brittle but it can

402
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,519
be very useful feature flagging which

403
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,639
you should have anyways

404
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,079
where you can say this particular

405
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,399
feature is on or off for any particular

406
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,200
user

407
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,040
well that's really great in an emergency

408
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,959
because you can say okay sharing is off

409
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,800
no one has sharing it it just doesn't

410
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,240
work anymore

411
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,320
then you can turn it back on once you've

412
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,360
fixed it

413
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
a messy or partial fix is often better

414
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,279
than no fix even if you put a fix in and

415
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,720
then you have to immediately fix your

416
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,839
fix

417
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,880
still usually better than nothing and

418
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,399
here's where it gets tricky

419
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
because you have to remember you can't

420
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
unleak someone's data this is not money

421
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,720
it's not

422
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,200
fungible you can't stop the bad thing

423
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,600
from happening and go back in time

424
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
but if you're noisy about how you fix it

425
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
or you're not careful in your fix

426
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,560
your fix could have a bug or you can

427
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,760
cause

428
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,880
your users more problems by being noisy

429
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,760
so for example if you have leaked some

430
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,200
personal data about people

431
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
and then you say well one thing i could

432
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,720
do is i could take down the service and

433
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:28,959
be

434
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
and tell everybody a bad thing happened

435
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,200
but if there's another copy of the data

436
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
over here

437
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,800
well at that point you're just saying

438
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,560
hey i have a bad privacy issue i have a

439
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,360
bad privacy issue go look here

440
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,959
and that can actually cause more harm to

441
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,600
users the choices can be very convoluted

442
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,639
and very tricky

443
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,519
think about them in advance this third

444
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,360
step is cleaning up the blood

445
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040
so let's talk about short-term

446
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,600
remediation versus long-term remediation

447
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,839
short-term remediation fixes the problem

448
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,120
so

449
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
for example i have a bad cookie on my

450
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,160
website

451
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,000
don't like that i'm going to remove that

452
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,279
cookie but

453
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,880
that may still leave my system in a

454
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,240
brittle state somebody could just go and

455
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,199
put the cookie back

456
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,040
actually maybe if i just do a new binary

457
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,880
release the cookie will come back

458
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,680
so that's not good we also need to do

459
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
longer term remediation to get from a

460
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,720
not broken state

461
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,079
into a good state so in our cookie

462
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,680
example we might scan for other

463
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,959
unexpected cookies

464
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
uh make sure that we're checking our

465
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,079
code scanning our

466
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,440
third-party code and scanning our

467
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,800
add-ons before they're added to our

468
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,240
website in the future

469
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,399
or even better we can make active guards

470
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,680
against setting cookies

471
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,199
which aren't allowed and an active guard

472
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,320
is always better than a

473
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,600
than monitoring for things because

474
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,199
an active guard will stop your problem

475
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,959
from happening monitoring will tell you

476
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,560
you have a problem which is way better

477
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,600
than nothing

478
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,320
but it's not our perfect one so how do

479
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,839
we know which one things to do

480
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,120
that's something we go through in the

481
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,560
postmortem which i'm going to talk about

482
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
next

483
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,279
but first i want to make a note about

484
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,959
humans and remediation

485
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,320
there's a lot of remediation that needs

486
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
to happen immediately right

487
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,279
we know we need to do it we're just

488
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
going to do it it'll get done but there

489
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,480
are some cases where

490
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,560
the right answer may be putting off some

491
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
of that remediation

492
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,760
and in that case you want to fight this

493
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,839
normal human tendency to put this off

494
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,440
and in the favor of kind of shiny

495
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
feature work

496
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,519
so i want to align my incentives when i

497
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,880
get into that state

498
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,240
so for example if there's a bunch of

499
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,480
manual work that my team needs to do to

500
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,000
keep that problem from recurring

501
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,279
i want to make sure that the team who

502
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,680
needs to fix the problem also feels that

503
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,399
pain

504
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,120
right that they have they have a very

505
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,680
upfront

506
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,959
incentive to remediate that so

507
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,040
maybe they have to work with me on it

508
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,279
they have to do a bunch of that work

509
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,600
or maybe i have their vp sign in blood

510
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
that it's going to get fixed by a

511
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,240
particular time

512
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,920
there's a couple reasons why this works

513
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,399
one of them is that well

514
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,240
the vp honestly only has a little bit of

515
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,839
time they can't spend

516
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,240
all day going and saying no you don't

517
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,440
need to fix your thing right now you

518
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,399
don't need to fix your thing

519
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,160
you don't need to fix your thing also

520
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,360
they don't want to take a whole bunch of

521
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
risk they want their product to remain

522
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
a product and remain in a good state

523
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
another thing is that product teams

524
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,000
don't like showing up and being like

525
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,240
hello vp

526
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,399
please uh give me an exception because

527
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,600
my product and or and or system is not

528
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
working very well and i would like to

529
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,399
remain

530
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,920
in a state where it doesn't work well

531
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,240
right most vp nobody wants to say that

532
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,680
to their vp

533
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
so that can those things that can help

534
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,440
move that along

535
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,199
so let's talk about post-mortems

536
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
post-mortems are where we sit down and

537
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:39,920
we learn

538
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
what went well what would poorly what

539
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,279
happened and why

540
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,440
and our goal of doing a postmortem is to

541
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,560
avoid this incident

542
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,880
and related classes of incident so what

543
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,600
are we doing

544
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,040
we're going to look for our underlying

545
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,160
causes say well this happened

546
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
what happened caused this what caused

547
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,519
this what caused this at least three

548
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,560
times

549
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
go deeper so for example if we have

550
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,560
somebody who went

551
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,160
and clicked a button and they cost a

552
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,919
data set to be visible to everyone

553
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,559
inside the company well that's not good

554
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,839
but we could blame that person or we

555
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,760
could say why do i have that button

556
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,720
what is that button even for how did we

557
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,000
get to a state where we had the button

558
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,839
maybe we fixed the button

559
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,760
and then we wanted blameless postmortem

560
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,039
because otherwise people are going to

561
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,640
hide things right people will come up

562
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
with all sorts of reasons

563
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
when really what we wanted to do was

564
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
just make the

565
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
make the bug go away we just want it to

566
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,919
not happen again and that person

567
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,320
like that person who clicked that button

568
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,960
they know

569
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,280
now know better than anybody else what

570
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
happens when you click that button

571
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,760
if you just go fire them you're not

572
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,799
actually

573
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,720
reducing the number of people who could

574
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,120
click the button in the future

575
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,600
so i'm not saying that you never want to

576
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,360
fire people like so for example when

577
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,799
twitter had that problem where

578
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,160
they had an insider attacker who sold

579
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
data to the saudi intelligence service

580
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,520
like that's really bad and you should

581
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,360
definitely fire them

582
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
but the post-mortem meeting is also not

583
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,559
where to discuss that the post-mortem

584
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,360
meeting would be

585
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,840
where you discuss hey how do we make our

586
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,679
system more resilient to insider

587
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,440
attackers

588
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,919
and then we can go and look for related

589
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,480
issues

590
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,360
and fix and guard against all of these

591
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,840
issues

592
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,000
we can talk about things like fixing

593
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,760
bugs hardening systems

594
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,919
we can avoid failure modes or make

595
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,240
active guards against failures we can

596
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,520
reduce access

597
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,600
we can use we can get better monitoring

598
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,559
and alerting

599
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,400
and we can do training now this

600
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,480
shouldn't be your first line of

601
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
defense it shouldn't be your second line

602
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,480
of defense but

603
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,559
make sure that your privacy and security

604
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,840
teams know what's going wrong at the

605
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,039
very least

606
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,799
and you can also use this to improve

607
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
your incident response process

608
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,799
right are you finding the right people

609
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,880
and that includes things like legal and

610
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,440
comms

611
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,480
privacy security and the engineers who

612
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
are working on that incident

613
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,679
were they able to find the data that

614
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,200
they needed in order to debug that

615
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,080
incident

616
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,679
were they able to remediate that

617
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,120
incident quickly

618
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,039
you should be looking at your incidents

619
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,600
to improve your incidents

620
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,799
so thank you very very much uh i

621
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,799
also put up for you a sample incident

622
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,799
document this is the document

623
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,440
that um i wrote at humu that's the one

624
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,280
that our auditors said

625
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,679
was great and they wished everybody used

626
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,559
it so

627
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,559
if you want it it is totally yours thank

628
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,200
you to humu for for donating that

629
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,520
i've also included some bonus content in

630
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
my slides

631
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,679
because i wrote too much so if you want

632
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,360
to know things about which

633
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,760
metrics help you in handling incidents

634
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,520
and which ones can cause things to go

635
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,240
pretty horribly awry look up my slides

636
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,039
later

637
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:53,840
thank you

638
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,879
you
