1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,719
good morning everyone

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,719
my name is amanda walker i'm going to

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,559
talk about

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
using access-based access control for

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,760
things beyond just access control

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,680
in particular to implement privacy and

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
security policies

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,760
i'm going to draw on my experience at my

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,039
previous job at google

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,679
and my current job at nuna both of which

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,119
involved handling a lot of sensitive

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:31,679
information

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,719
and applying data handling policies

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,040
unfortunately the systems that

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,640
implemented this at both companies are

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,239
proprietary so i'm not going to be

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
giving code snippets things like this

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,440
this is more of a lessons learned talk

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,879
i'm going to start by giving an

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,000
overview of what attribute based access

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,079
control actually is

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,399
and then some of the aspects of it that

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,520
are useful

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,000
and things to keep in mind when you're

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,960
applying this

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
more broadly than just for access

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,800
control

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,240
so to start access control

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,320
over the years has evolved a lot

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,119
originally it was things like

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,840
physical switches on disks and you know

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,799
on media and

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,439
and devices that controlled whether or

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,439
not you know right circuitry was engaged

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,119
so this was a property of a device it

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,000
wasn't attached to any particular data

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,040
sometimes it was attached to media later

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,520
on

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,680
the star access control started being

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
mediated by identity

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,600
a classic example of that is unix

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,640
permissions

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
where an access decision is made based

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,159
on who you are

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,640
uh what groups you're in and what the

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
permissions on a particular file or

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,000
directory are um this is

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
still pretty uh pretty simplistic

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,759
although it has uh

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,360
it has stood the test of time it's still

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,640
used pretty much everywhere

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,000
business rules started to be being

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,840
applied to access controls with

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
role-based access control

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
where instead of just as a function of

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,119
identity the

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,520
access decisions are made as a function

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,840
of what roles the user has or is

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,200
assigned

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,680
what authorizations are associated with

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
this those roles

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,959
this is often called our back or

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
role-based access control

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,280
group membership tests are often used as

65
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,640
a version of this

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
the idea is you can change what groups

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,080
someone's in without changing their

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,680
identity so as they move from role to

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,000
role within an organization

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,920
the authorization can follow with them

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,040
but even that gets to be a problem um

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
one of the things i've seen in a couple

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,160
organizations i've been part of

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,920
is that group membership is used as a

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,239
proxy for other kinds of attributes of

76
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,120
the user

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
or of their role so for example i might

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
badge into an office in

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,599
in the us i get put into the is

80
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
currently in the u.s group

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
and some authorizations follow along

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
with that i badge into an office in

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,319
europe

84
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
i get put into the is currently in

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,360
europe group

86
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,319
this mostly works but it is not

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,680
something

88
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
that scales very well

89
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
updating a large group database

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,760
especially across a very large

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,800
organization

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,680
can be slow it can introduce consistency

93
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
problems

94
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
and latency problems because any kind of

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,480
global

96
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
state like a group you know a group

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,319
membership list

98
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
can take time to propagate and so

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,519
around the turn of the century

100
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,080
people started uh saying well how can we

101
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,599
incorporate more that kind of context

102
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,799
more directly

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,360
uh and so i started looking at access

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,959
control as a function of the attributes

105
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:39,680
of the user

106
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,080
the data the source and destinations of

107
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,440
a computation

108
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,959
uh the nature or purpose of a

109
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,799
computation and other kinds of policy

110
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,440
constraints

111
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,799
the blanket term for this is attribute

112
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,400
based access control and it first

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,879
appeared around 2000

114
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,560
like any good piece of technology there

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
are many standards to choose from here

116
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,400
uh oasis was sort of first out of the

117
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,560
gate with xacml

118
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
in 2001 which was a language for

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,200
describing policies

120
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,959
was not actually a mechanism it was more

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,720
of a you know how to specify these

122
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,480
things formally so they could be

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,040
evaluated by by an automated mechanism

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,680
nist has put forth a standard or

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,240
publication about this

126
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,280
again fairly abstract covers book

127
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,520
abstractions and vocabulary to use

128
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,639
things like that

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,360
to try and uh you know line up different

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
specific systems and see how they

131
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,840
correspond

132
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,440
microsoft has has a mechanism for this

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,240
most recently and there are many private

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
and proprietary systems as well

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,800
but they all have some common attributes

136
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
they all

137
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,360
attributes fall into four main buckets

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,720
in all of these systems

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
there's the subject so that is who or

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
what is doing the acting

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,360
a person uh a an automated role account

142
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,280
something like that uh some other system

143
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,120
uh there's an action which is you know

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,280
the computation being performed usually

145
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
or

146
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,759
access that is being requested

147
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,800
there's object which is what access is

148
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,120
being requested for

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,840
and then other context this could be

150
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
things like

151
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,880
time of day geographic location of any

152
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,360
of these

153
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,720
or all of these or other contextual

154
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
information

155
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,960
and let's see um

156
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
to do this two very two different

157
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,840
different general approaches were uh

158
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,720
were developed uh one branch of this

159
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
ended up putting

160
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
additional attributes on to objects so

161
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,639
data objects code objects things like

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,680
that

163
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,960
sort of as a generalization of

164
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,199
permissions or you know

165
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,720
ownership tags things like that

166
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,120
this has a bunch of pros it can be fast

167
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,039
rules can be evaluated right on the spot

168
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,199
in line by examining the properties

169
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,919
of you know the data the user the

170
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,560
container

171
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
things like that right at the policy

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
enforcement point so it can be

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,080
effectively as fast as a permissions

174
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
check

175
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
and it's fairly transparent if you look

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,560
at the code that is you know

177
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
implementing this policy it will

178
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,160
it'll often have the policy written out

179
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
in code right there if this

180
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,919
and this then accept

181
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,758
or reject as the case may be

182
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,280
these are also the cons because it's

183
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,880
decentralized updating one of these

184
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,960
rules can be very painful

185
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
if the rules are written out in line as

186
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
code

187
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
then you have to go change all the code

188
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,360
if the policy changes

189
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,120
and even across a large code base even

190
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,800
with a lot of automated tools

191
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,120
this can take a while and you can miss

192
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
them you end up with policy consistent

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
problems even if you centralize it into

194
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,000
something like a library or macros that

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,319
are in

196
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
that are included

197
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,120
this just makes it only a little easier

198
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,639
if a library you still have to rebuild

199
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,319
everything push new binaries things like

200
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,280
that

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,599
and not every useful attribute is static

202
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,120
not everything that you might want to

203
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,000
know about a file for example

204
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,319
remains static over the course of its

205
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,520
lifetime

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,160
same thing's true for data and so that's

207
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,800
where these things

208
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
tend to fall down it ends up being kind

209
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
of a variation of the group membership

210
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,319
test as a proxy for other kinds of

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
attributes

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,759
the more general approach is a policy

213
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
service where you bundle up all of the

214
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,240
attributes

215
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,960
of the data the actor the computation

216
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,160
and so on

217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,919
and send them off to a policy service

218
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,280
which gives you a go no-go

219
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,919
answer this has some advantages the

220
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,639
rules can be

221
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,919
generalized and centralized

222
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,360
they can take effect immediately if you

223
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,520
need to do a rule change

224
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
and dynamic attributes can be computed

225
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,280
or looked up on demand

226
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,680
so you can represent things explicitly

227
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,720
like

228
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
okay if this person is in the

229
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,919
engineering group and is within the u.s

230
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,560
and the data is marked as u.s access

231
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,120
only

232
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,000
then grant access and that you don't

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
have some of the consistency problems

234
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,560
you do if you try to

235
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,840
push these things out to group

236
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,160
membership or static attributes

237
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,840
uh the disadvantages are that it's much

238
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,599
slower it's a remote

239
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,880
procedure call or an api request things

240
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,679
like that

241
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,120
and that means the service has to be

242
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,799
reachable you now have a distributed

243
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,159
systems problem

244
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,839
uh with all of that all that that brings

245
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,760
along as far as latency

246
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,040
uh traffic planning capacity planning

247
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,839
and so on

248
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
so these are two very different ends of

249
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,040
the same spectrum

250
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,160
it turns out you need both um object

251
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,760
attributes are great

252
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,399
for attributes that are static for the

253
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,120
lifetime

254
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,080
of an object and need to be evaluated

255
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,640
quickly

256
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,279
so a column in a row of a database an

257
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,200
extended attribute on a file in a

258
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
directory full of a lot of files

259
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,240
things like that they're not so good

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
as though as the attributes get more

261
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,680
abstract

262
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,360
and as you need to enforce policies

263
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
sort of at the computation level rather

264
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,720
than the data element level

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
one way to think of this is that access

266
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
is really a special case

267
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
it's a special case of questions like

268
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,519
should this computation

269
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,160
proceed should this computation include

270
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
this data

271
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,000
and those the criteria for those

272
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,880
questions

273
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,440
are often more than identity or group

274
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,000
membership

275
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,320
or or data classification they can

276
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,000
include things like purpose

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,760
uh is this for user interaction are you

278
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,120
serving this data back to the user that

279
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,160
provided it

280
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,519
is it for personalization are you

281
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,519
building an ml model of you know this

282
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,800
user's actions

283
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,040
so that you can tailor future responses

284
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,160
to that user's

285
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,040
uh behavior is it for monetization if so

286
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,519
is it

287
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,760
individual or is it aggregate is it for

288
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,279
research purposes are you doing queries

289
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,680
across a population and building a model

290
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,519
or generating statistics or reports

291
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,200
based on that

292
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,240
is it for security or anti-abuse

293
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,560
can you tell if this is you know someone

294
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,200
a spam or is a real user or as a bot

295
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,120
or things like that and there are

296
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,399
ancillary uses there are there are

297
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,200
additional business uses that pop up

298
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,880
many times if once you have the capacity

299
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
to do this kind of

300
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
analysis over a lot of data but that

301
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
data may have restrictions on what it

302
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,160
can be used for

303
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
jurisdiction is a common one and

304
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
different countries have different rules

305
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,120
but even jurisdiction is is a function

306
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
it's not really a static attribute

307
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,279
you know by analogy if i'm a us citizen

308
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,640
traveling in europe

309
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,720
uh am i under european jurisdiction or

310
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,839
usa jurisdiction

311
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,839
the answer depends on what policy it is

312
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,519
if it's a traffic law

313
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,560
it's wherever i happen to be if it's

314
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,600
something like

315
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,160
uh can i bring this cheese home with me

316
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,600
switzerland or france might be quite

317
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,680
happy to sell me nice delicious raw milk

318
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,480
cheese

319
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
and as soon as i you know land back in

320
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,519
the u.s

321
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,120
u.s customs and border patrol is going

322
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,560
to have a problem with that

323
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,240
so even jurisdiction is four nearer than

324
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,279
it often seems upfront

325
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,959
similarly there are public policy

326
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,320
questions

327
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,440
public does not always mean

328
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
unconstrained we're used to thinking of

329
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
that in the computer science community

330
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
it's like well it's publicly readable

331
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,880
therefore there aren't any constraints

332
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
on it

333
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,079
well you know as companies like google

334
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,000
discovered with right to be forgotten

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
and other companies have discovered when

336
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,440
they used

337
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,480
nominally public information to do

338
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,200
computations that surprised users either

339
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,519
by

340
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,160
for recommendations or other kinds of

341
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,959
analysis

342
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,120
users have expectations about public

343
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,600
information about them

344
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,519
this is a particularly showing up in the

345
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,120
u.s around things like property records

346
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,680
and tax records

347
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,320
some of which are are public by design

348
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,000
but will never be designed

349
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
never been they were never designed to

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,600
be queried horizontally across a

351
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
population all at once

352
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,320
and their internal policy applications

353
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,519
companies or organizations often have

354
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,160
policies designed in some cases to keep

355
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,959
honest people honest

356
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,560
make sure that you can't do certain

357
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,600
kinds of actions unilaterally

358
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,720
a good example might be

359
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,959
okay this kind of administrative access

360
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,000
is

361
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,760
permissible if the person requesting it

362
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,079
is you know a member of the customer

363
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,120
service team

364
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,079
and they are currently assigned a ticket

365
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,200
related to

366
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,040
this user's data or this customer's data

367
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,120
that's something really hard to to code

368
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,399
as a

369
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,880
traditional access control check but if

370
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
you can have a policy service that can

371
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,200
look up that

372
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,320
information and determine the value of

373
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,920
a currently assigned a ticket that's

374
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
relevant as an attribute

375
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,000
you can then you can then automate this

376
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,160
so the biggest uh

377
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,240
the biggest lesson learned that i can

378
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
that i can pass along

379
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
from having grappled with a bunch of

380
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,600
concrete instantiations of most of these

381
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,360
is that you need to think beyond access

382
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,680
many privacy policies are not just about

383
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,519
who can access what

384
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,480
or security policies are about you know

385
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
what groups somebody needs to be in

386
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,560
you know what kinds of acls are in place

387
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,880
they're about purposes and jurisdiction

388
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,680
there's a reason behind most of these

389
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,160
rules

390
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
even if they ended up even if they end

391
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
up getting encoded in traditional

392
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,839
you know acl or clearance and

393
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,760
authorization

394
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,839
frameworks and so if you dig down to the

395
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
why

396
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,240
you can express them in more in closed

397
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
form if you can evaluate

398
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,720
these kinds of attributes more directly

399
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,079
and expectations agreements and

400
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,240
regulations change a layer of

401
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,440
interaction here

402
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,959
where you're calling a policy server

403
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,399
which takes all of the attributes in

404
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,040
question

405
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
goes and looks up what the current

406
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
policy is and evaluates that

407
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,800
makes it much easier to adapt it makes

408
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,160
it much easier to

409
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,199
add or remove constraints as laws and

410
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,880
regulations change

411
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,079
or as user expectations change or

412
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,600
you know a company legal department says

413
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,639
we're going to change our terms of

414
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,199
service

415
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,399
and ask people to to consent to that

416
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
and so when you're looking at this

417
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
trying to automate some of these kinds

418
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,320
of

419
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
of policies that are hard to implement

420
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,279
and hard to automate using traditional

421
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,040
methods

422
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
dig down ask why um things that are

423
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,440
phrased as

424
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,639
group membership or are back are often

425
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,199
proxies for more abstract rules

426
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,440
that you can compute dynamically you can

427
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
go look up in another system

428
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,079
you can correlate you can write

429
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,000
arbitrary amounts of code to go

430
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
find the information it needs compute

431
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,360
what how would this policy should be

432
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,839
evaluated right at this moment

433
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,360
and give an answer based on that

434
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,920
one aspect of this is this works best

435
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,839
for policies that are

436
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,079
executed infrequently by computer terms

437
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,560
uh on large amounts of data so starting

438
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
up an analysis job

439
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,639
should this job start are all the

440
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,560
conditions right or did someone make a

441
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,800
mistake

442
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
should this come broad horizontal

443
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
computation involve

444
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,040
all of these data sets or should we skip

445
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,000
ones that don't

446
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,920
fulfill such and such a condition things

447
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,519
like that

448
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,680
and if you can't if you find you can't

449
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,600
write a piece of code to evaluate

450
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,360
a policy given all of these kinds of

451
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
attributes

452
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,480
ask what information is missing um

453
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,399
ask no determine whether it can be

454
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
recorded somewhere that a policy service

455
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,759
can read it

456
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
this has come up in the past a number of

457
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,160
times around consent for example

458
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
if you ask the user a question about can

459
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,199
i use your

460
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,160
can we use your data for this purpose

461
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,199
record the answer

462
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,959
you know it's not just a user interface

463
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,240
prompt it's it's recording something

464
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,399
from from that user that should be

465
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,839
referred to later on

466
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,959
uh when making policy decisions about

467
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,839
data

468
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,519
collected from or about that user for

469
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,839
example

470
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,120
and sometimes there are other systems

471
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
that expose state that affect whether a

472
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
policy applies

473
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,560
i used an example earlier of being

474
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,320
assigned a trouble ticket

475
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
another good example would be say you

476
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
have a site reliability engineer who's

477
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
debugging a service that isn't working

478
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,600
properly

479
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,839
many organizations have a have a

480
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,759
procedure called break glass

481
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,560
where somebody can request

482
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,240
extraordinary authorization

483
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
while giving a reason and relying on

484
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,760
basically auditing that

485
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,160
later so that they can get a service

486
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,679
back up and running so that they can

487
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
resolve a fault

488
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,039
and having a way that that's exposed you

489
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,119
can record yes so and so invoked break

490
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,079
glass

491
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,319
uh and applying to these systems

492
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,480
bypass what would what would normally be

493
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
allowed to proceed

494
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,200
is a good way to automate that without

495
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,039
without putting up lots of roadblocks in

496
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,520
front

497
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,640
of those kinds of operations but still

498
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,720
automating whatever you can

499
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
and recording it so that it can be

500
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,960
audited later

501
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,320
uh and that's looks like it's about

502
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,039
time's up so thank you very much um i

503
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,039
look forward to questions on

504
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,039
zoom and slack during the conference um

505
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
you're also welcome to email me

506
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,200
uh afterwards at awoker nuna.com and

507
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,320
happy to compare notes on this thanks a

508
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
lot

509
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
you
