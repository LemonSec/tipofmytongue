1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,400
hi there everyone

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,320
good morning good afternoon or good

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,360
evening depending on where you're

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,639
joining us from

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,199
thank you so much for coming my name is

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,000
max hunter

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,080
and i work as an engineering director at

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,240
the electronic frontier foundation

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,480
primarily focused on software projects

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,119
to encrypt the internet

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,080
so eff is a non-profit organization that

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,119
works to protect

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,600
privacy freedom of expression and

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
innovation for all users of technology

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,280
you may have heard of some of eff's

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,120
legal victories over the years

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,160
we've had some landmark wins for example

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,960
we helped in bernstein v department of

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,399
justice to establish

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,480
that first amendment protections apply

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,120
to programming code

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,600
we ensured that free speech and privacy

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,480
protections in cda230 remained intact

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:58,800
through

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
numerous legal challenges and

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
we were helping to ensure that fourth

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,438
amendment protections apply to cell

28
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,960
phone location data

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
through our support in amicus briefs and

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,159
carpenter v the united states

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,840
these are just some of the wins that

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,360
we've had there have been

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
hundreds of high impact cases throughout

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,439
the years

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
eff has also worked on software projects

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
that you may be familiar with

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,920
we have browser extensions like privacy

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,680
badger which is a

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,159
an extension that helps to protect the

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,759
privacy of millions by stopping

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,040
advertisers and

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,520
other third-party trackers from secretly

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
monitoring users behavior

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,320
as they browse the web we also maintain

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
https everywhere

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
this is a browser add-on that helps to

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,399
ensure that your client

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
defaults to the encrypted connection

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,119
with many major websites

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,759
making your browsing more secure when

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,720
site swaps or

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,719
offer both http and https connections

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,640
we also build and maintain sertbot

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
that's the project that i work on

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,880
a free open source software tool that

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
fetches and configures let's encrypt

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,080
certificates

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,959
to encrypt web traffic surpod is used to

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,239
secure traffic to

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,640
tens of millions of sites in the process

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,239
helping to protect the privacy of

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,760
hundreds of millions of visitors

63
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,080
eff also works to push back on harmful

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
technology policy ideas

65
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,080
we do this through a combination of

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,440
legislative

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
activism and policy work both

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,519
online and offline that's what i'll be

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,280
talking a little bit more about today

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,400
today we'll be exploring two cases that

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
eff is working on to push back against

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,879
bad legislation

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,080
as i said we've got quite a long history

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,879
of doing this

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,080
since the 1990s eff has worked to

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,920
fight to protect users ability to use

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,599
strong encryption

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,280
encryption that's uncompromised by the

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,959
tampering of governments that are

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,599
interested

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,640
in enabling mass surveillance

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
in the 1990s we worked with leading

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,480
cryptographers from academia

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,560
civil society and industry around the

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
world to

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,599
fight back against the clinton

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,760
administration's disastrous clippership

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
proposal

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
which would have required companies to

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
create mechanisms to defeat commercial

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,239
encryption

92
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,920
we won this campaign we also defended

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
against export restrictions that would

94
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,200
have regulated development

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
and distribution of strong encryption

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,000
more recently you might have seen that

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
we launched a campaign with hundreds of

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,879
thousands of

99
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,440
supporters successfully pressuring the

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,760
obama administration to drop their plans

101
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920
to explore mandates for cryptographic

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,559
backdoors

103
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,440
and that was the end of the crypto wars

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,239
with no more bad policy suggestions ever

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,120
and we can

106
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,959
close this talk out and move to

107
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,360
questions

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,040
that is what i would love to say of

109
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,519
course but of course these conversations

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,799
continue to this day

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,439
and 2020 has brought us a host of new

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,439
threats to encryption

113
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,799
this debate is very much still ongoing

114
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,799
and the greatest of these threats within

115
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,040
the united states has been a legislative

116
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,479
battle over the earn it act

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,320
now earn it will strip away section 230

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,840
protections

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,160
for any website or service provider that

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,199
doesn't follow a list of best practices

121
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,800
leaving those companies exposed to

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
liability that would most likely lead to

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,560
bankruptcy

124
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
this best practices list and air quotes

125
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
would be created by a government

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
commission and this commission would be

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,680
headed by attorney general barr

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
barr has a long history of pressuring

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
commercial security providers

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
to break the encryption of their users

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,320
in the name of lawful access

132
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
just two weeks ago the earned act passed

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
the senate judiciary committee

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
and has now been introduced to the house

135
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,120
of representatives

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,199
so to really get a feel for the

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,120
potential implications of earn it

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
you need to imagine an internet where

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,039
the law requires that every encrypted

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,080
message

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
that sent be read by government-approved

142
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
scanning software

143
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,039
companies that handle such messages

144
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,240
wouldn't be allowed to protect the

145
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,520
privacy of their users

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
or they'd risk losing the legal

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
protections that's

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,440
uh they have under cda230 which are

149
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,680
responsible essentially for their

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
freedom to operate

151
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,039
you can't have an internet where

152
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,440
messengers like this are scanned on mass

153
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,000
and also

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,160
have end-to-end encryption any more than

155
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,919
you can create back doors that can only

156
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,479
be used by law enforcement

157
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,039
any mechanism that is used by lawful

158
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,800
authorities to gain access to private

159
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,520
messages

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,440
or otherwise infer the content of those

161
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,560
messages

162
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,919
has the potential for abuse

163
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,960
third-party access like this commission

164
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,319
would likely recommend

165
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
to encrypted communications is

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,440
impossible

167
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,039
it's built into the definition of

168
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,039
end-to-end encryption

169
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,759
concepts like client-side scanning are

170
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
not a method to circumvent this

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,199
client-side scanning is just another

172
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,919
method of breaking end-to-end encryption

173
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,160
either a message that is sent remains

174
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,560
private to everyone

175
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
but the sender and its intended

176
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,199
recipients or it is no longer end to end

177
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,479
encrypted

178
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,880
it's a fairly simple concept that no one

179
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,039
but you and your intended recipients

180
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,639
should be able to read your private

181
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,039
messages or otherwise

182
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,960
analyze or make inferences about the

183
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
content of what you're talking about

184
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
this is the fundamental promise that

185
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
encrypted messaging services

186
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,199
make to their users requirements that

187
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,560
earn it could put forward like

188
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,080
client-side scanning

189
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,199
would break that promise

190
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,680
so recently an amendment was put forward

191
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
by senator patrick leahy

192
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,639
a democrat from vermont it was voted

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,599
into the bill and

194
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,840
purports to protect encryption from

195
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
being the state's focus

196
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
it is definitely an improvement but

197
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
we're still concerned that the amended

198
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,319
earn it bill

199
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,599
could be used to attack encryption

200
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
senator leahy's amendment prohibits

201
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,840
companies uh from being held viable

202
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,720
because they use

203
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,440
end-to-end encryption device encryption

204
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
or other encryption services

205
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
but the bill still encourages state

206
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,319
lawmakers to look for loopholes

207
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
it allows the states to undermine

208
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
end-to-end encryption by doing things

209
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
like demanding that messengers be

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
scanned on a local device

211
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
before they're encrypted and sent along

212
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,080
to the recipient

213
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,680
we think that would violate the spirit

214
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
of senator leahy's amendment certainly

215
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
the intentions were positive

216
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
but the bill as it is currently written

217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
opens the door for that question to be

218
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,960
litigated

219
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,080
over and over again in courts across the

220
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,599
country

221
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,759
the newly revised earned act would allow

222
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,599
all 50 state legislatures

223
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,360
as well as the u.s territories and

224
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
washington dc

225
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,599
to pass laws that would regulate the

226
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
internet that would

227
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,479
bring about new regulations for

228
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,960
encrypted messaging as well

229
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,199
by breaking section 230 of the

230
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
communications decency act

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,199
the earn it bill would allow large

232
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
messaging services

233
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,520
and small website owners alike to be

234
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,160
sued

235
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,000
or prosecuted under state laws

236
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,800
i believe an eff believes that offering

237
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
strong privacy protections

238
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,799
to users shouldn't make messaging

239
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,000
services liable for prosecution

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
even with the new revisions for senator

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,039
leahy

242
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,480
ernit would do just that so

243
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
if you're a u.s citizen we encourage you

244
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,399
to contact your representatives to

245
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,000
speak out against the threat to user

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
privacy and earn it

247
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,200
we've created a number of online

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,360
activism tools that users can use to

249
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
find their representatives

250
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,360
and share their feelings about strong

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,920
encryption

252
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
however the us earned act is not the

253
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
only ongoing legislative threat to

254
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,680
privacy

255
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,519
in 2020 two legislative efforts in both

256
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,720
india and brazil

257
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
pose serious threats to privacy of

258
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,200
encrypted messaging services

259
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,040
both efforts are aimed towards

260
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,839
determining the originator of

261
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,240
misinformation

262
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,880
and in both cases the legislation will

263
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,760
not help

264
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,399
with the problem of misinformation but

265
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,200
they will

266
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
significantly weaken the privacy

267
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,560
protecting properties of end-to-end

268
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,080
encrypted messaging services

269
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,399
now my colleagues katico rodriguez and

270
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,240
verdiana alemante

271
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
have analyzed the privacy implications

272
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,000
of the brazilian legislation

273
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
along with my former colleague seth

274
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,120
shone

275
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
and i'll be sharing some of the research

276
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
that the three of them have done

277
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,000
now

278
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
so whatsapp is the most popular

279
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
encrypted messaging tool used in brazil

280
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
and as such has been the focus of the

281
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,320
pls 2630-2020 bill

282
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
the legislation seeks to compel

283
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,000
messaging services to be able to

284
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
determine the originator of forwarded

285
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,360
messages

286
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,519
or like earn it would threaten their

287
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,399
liability

288
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,600
threaten them with liability there's

289
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
been

290
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,800
minimal discussion relatively on the

291
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
impact that this legislation

292
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
would have on other tools and services

293
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,839
like telegram

294
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,040
signal and imessage that offer privacy

295
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,839
protecting and

296
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,399
encryption although these tools are

297
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,160
conspicuously absent from the public

298
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
discourse they would almost certainly be

299
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,880
impacted

300
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,200
by the traceability mandate that the

301
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,160
legislators are considering

302
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
whatsapp has faced widespread

303
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,760
international pressure to

304
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,519
curb the flow of misinformation on the

305
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,360
platform

306
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
in brazil this pressure was refocused

307
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
during the 2018 presidential election

308
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,480
where bolsonaro's supporters used the

309
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,440
platform

310
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,120
to spread misinformation about his

311
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
opponents

312
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,120
now whatsapp's forwarding feature is

313
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,079
implemented using

314
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,760
privacy by design on the server side

315
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
forwarded messages are designed to be

316
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
completely indistinguishable from other

317
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
forms of communication

318
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,800
so when a whatsapp message is forwarded

319
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,600
by a user

320
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,320
using the forwarding arrow the forwarded

321
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,959
status

322
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,720
is appended to the message on the client

323
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,160
side entirely

324
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,320
and the forwarded count is incremented

325
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,200
towards

326
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,880
uh the five limit uh so after five

327
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,320
forwards a message is considered

328
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,880
mass-forwarded but nothing about this

329
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
forwarding status

330
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,880
is returned to whatsapp's infrastructure

331
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
the messaging platform

332
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,480
gains no additional knowledge about the

333
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,160
message's contents

334
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,440
this is sound design for privacy

335
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,200
if a messaging service were to comply

336
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,959
with this traceability mandate that's

337
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,079
being considered

338
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,920
they would be required to move away from

339
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,120
the privacy by design

340
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
implementation for counting forwards

341
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
they would need to move information

342
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,600
about the number of times a message has

343
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,399
been forwarded

344
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,959
from the client to the server gaining

345
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,160
additional knowledge

346
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,680
about the content of the message it is a

347
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,079
core tenant of privacy-centric systems

348
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:24,800
design

349
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,200
to only gather and retain the minimum

350
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,920
information

351
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
required for the functionality of a

352
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,320
particular feature

353
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,639
requiring encrypted messaging services

354
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,560
to retain this information

355
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,279
violates this tenant and it undermines

356
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
the user's trust in privacy-centric

357
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,680
software

358
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,399
fundamentally also message traceability

359
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,279
mandates like

360
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,279
pls 2630 2020 misunderstand the level of

361
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,560
centralization

362
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,240
in the secure messaging ecosystem

363
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,839
though the messaging apps might not

364
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,639
appear to be decentralized like email is

365
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,480
the idea of tracking when a user

366
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,639
forwards a message may depend on control

367
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,880
over client applications that simply

368
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,399
doesn't exist within this ecosystem

369
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,639
you can't have any way of guaranteeing

370
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,480
that all client applications

371
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,839
some of which are developed and

372
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,079
maintained by third parties

373
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,760
will comply with restrictions and

374
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,160
limitations in the same way or even

375
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,920
that it's technically feasible for them

376
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,360
to do so

377
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,440
some systems are simply too

378
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,880
decentralized

379
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,839
that is to say there's no central

380
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,720
organization

381
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
maintaining them responsible for

382
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
compliance

383
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,680
so this mandate assumes that application

384
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,959
providers are always

385
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,360
able to identify and distinguish between

386
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,079
forwarded

387
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,639
and non-forwarded content and also that

388
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,320
they're able to identify the origin of

389
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,399
the forwarded message

390
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,760
this in practice however depends on the

391
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,519
architecture of the service and

392
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,440
the relationship between the application

393
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,199
and the service

394
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,440
when the two are fully independent like

395
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,959
you see with email

396
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,360
it is common for the service not to be

397
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
able to differentiate between forwarded

398
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
and non-forwarded content

399
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
and that the application does not store

400
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,800
the forwarding history except for on the

401
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,320
user's device as

402
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,680
in the whatsapp design that we

403
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,920
previously discussed

404
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
this architectural separation is very

405
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,880
traditional in internet services

406
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
and while it's less common in modern

407
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,399
private messaging

408
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,880
applications the obligation would limit

409
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,240
the use of

410
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,880
xmpp and jabber or other similar

411
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,920
solutions like that

412
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,279
those this could also negatively impact

413
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,439
other open source messaging solutions

414
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,079
so some might make the argument that

415
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,399
these are acceptable privacy compromises

416
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,160
in the name of combating rumors and

417
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,000
disinformation

418
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,440
some people might say that it's worth

419
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,120
retaining additional information

420
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,040
if it can assist law enforcement with

421
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,279
ident with identifying the

422
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,480
originator of uh illegal messages

423
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,600
but this is not the case not only

424
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,360
will these traceability mandates

425
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,160
compromise user privacy

426
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,920
they won't effectively assist law

427
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,440
enforcement in identifying the

428
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
originator of content

429
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
attempting to do so by collecting

430
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
additional information

431
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,040
about message forwarding fundamentally

432
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,959
misunderstands the way the content is

433
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,839
shared on social media

434
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,199
secure messaging apps all the time users

435
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,399
will share content

436
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,199
which is originated on other platforms

437
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,320
entirely

438
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,440
for example a signal user might take a

439
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,079
screenshot

440
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,639
of a tweet or a facebook post distribute

441
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,160
it to a large group of encrypted

442
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,000
messaging users

443
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,199
in that case implementing traceability

444
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,560
would both weaken the privacy

445
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,720
protections of the messaging service

446
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,920
and only allow users or only allow

447
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,639
authorities rather to identify the user

448
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,000
who created the screenshot

449
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
there are certainly software design

450
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,240
solutions that can improve

451
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,000
the issue of mastery forward and

452
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
misinformation

453
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,920
we've explored a few of those already

454
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,199
such as limiting the number of

455
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,199
recipients for a forwarded message

456
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,480
or labeling viral messages

457
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,639
as viral indicating that they didn't

458
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,000
come from a user's

459
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,600
close contact however undermining the

460
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
privacy and security of millions of

461
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,639
people

462
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:36,880
is not a viable solution

463
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,360
so you might be asking what you as an

464
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,920
individual

465
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,000
can get can do to get involved with

466
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
these campaigns

467
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,839
and if you live either in the us or

468
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,680
brazil we would encourage you to contact

469
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,720
policy makers

470
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,880
to push back on these bad policy ideas

471
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,480
you can also you can do that by getting

472
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,720
involved with some of the organizations

473
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
that are leading the work to push back

474
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
on these proposals generators digitalis

475
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,680
uh

476
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,559
is leading some of the work in brazil uh

477
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,959
you can join them at derrish's

478

481
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,400
finally thank you all for your time and

482
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
support

483
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
none of the work that is done to protect

484
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,079
user privacy from overreach would be

485
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,959
possible

486
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,400
without your involvement and support

487
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,080
thank you all very much and let's move

488
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,840
on to questions
