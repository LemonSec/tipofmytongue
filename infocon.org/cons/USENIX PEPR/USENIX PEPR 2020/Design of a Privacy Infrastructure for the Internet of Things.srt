1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480
good morning i'm normance today with

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,559
carnegie mellon university and today i

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,639
would like to talk about or design

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
of a privacy infrastructure for the

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,760
internet of things this

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,520
is work together with a number of

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,600
collaborators whose names are

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,800
listed on this slide

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,720
those of us who've got iphones are

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
probably hopefully familiar with the

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
screens that are being shown here

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,599
these are the screens and similar

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,360
screens are available on android phones

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,280
these are the screens that we use

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,239
to manage the information that different

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,000
apps we've downloaded over time on our

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,719
phones

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,640
have the ability to access these are

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,079
also sometimes called permission

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
managers and the beauty of these types

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,680
of interfaces

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,920
is that they're combining everything in

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,239
one place you just go to these

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,480
uh these interfaces these permission

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,360
managers

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,960
and you get to see all the apps you've

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,480
downloaded over time and all the

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,920
different permissions that these apps

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,960
are requesting

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,800
when it comes to accessing information

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,479
such as your microphone

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
your contacts your location etc

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
but what about the internet of things

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,760
here it's a very different situation you

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,560
don't control

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
all the iot technologies that are

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,119
potentially going to be collecting data

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,920
around you you just don't have the same

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
level of control that you had when you

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,439
downloaded all these apps that you have

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,240
today on your

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,400
smartphone and in fact most of the time

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,560
you're not even aware of the presence

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
of those iot resources whether it's the

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,600
camera

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,439
that's collecting footage about you

47
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
whether it's a location tracking system

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,799
in a mall that's uh going to be looking

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,320
at your whereabouts place

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,280
based on bluetooth uh beacons or what

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
have you

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,520
and so the state of the art today is

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,560
basically

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,759
signs like this one here and obviously

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,280
if you're lucky enough perhaps you will

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,759
notice at this sign many of us often do

57
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,640
not even

58
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
notice them but even if you notice the

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,680
sign

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
can you tell me whether or not this

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,600
includes facial recognition can you tell

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,360
me who this data is going to be shared

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,080
with

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
can you tell me for how long that

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,160
footage is going to be retained

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
can you tell me whether you can opt in

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,440
or opt out

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
as it turns out many of these

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,599
pieces of information i've just gone

70
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,800
over

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
should in fact be disclosed under

72
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,959
regulations such as gdpr

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,440
or ccpa except there is no good

74
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,400
mechanism

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,680
for doing this and so if you think about

76
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,720
this a bit more

77
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,319
there are a couple of different options

78
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,080
that you could potentially

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,959
pursue one would be to post qr codes in

80
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
various places and hope that people see

81
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
these qr codes and take the time

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
to take snapshots of them and access

83
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,120
more information as they connect to

84
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,680
our different websites but this may not

85
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,360
necessarily work there are places that

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,480
are potentially

87
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,200
very large and where these signs might

88
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,800
be missed there are places where there's

89
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,319
no obvious place

90
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,120
where to post these signs in some other

91
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
places you might have a ton of people

92
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
who might all want to

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,959
access these qr codes at the same time

94
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,360
and so while this could work this also

95
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,480
has potentially some

96
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,120
disadvantages in some scenarios another

97
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
option would be to

98
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,599
inform you about nearby processes

99
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,400
collecting your

100
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
data based on your location as being

101
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
illustrated here

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,680
and that could work well too except that

103
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,720
you may also potentially

104
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
not take your form to see what's around

105
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
you unless you get

106
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,239
some kind of notification functionality

107
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:36,879
and so

108
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,879
perhaps the best way to go about this is

109
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,319
to try to

110
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,879
effectively combine these two approaches

111
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,440
and

112
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,239
this is the perspective that we've taken

113
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,120
in this iot

114
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
privacy infrastructure that we've

115
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
developed but uh

116
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
from a more global perspective your

117
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
objectives in developing this

118
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,480
infrastructure were twofold on the one

119
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,879
hand we wanted to make it very easy

120
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,640
for people who deploy these iot

121
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
technologies what we're going to be

122
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
referring to as iot resources

123
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,239
we wanted to make it very easy for them

124
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
to publicize the presence

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,560
of their resources under their practices

126
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,640
associated with these resources such as

127
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
what data has been collected but also

128
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,560
for instance what privacy options

129
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
might be available to people who are

130
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,600
come

131
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
near these resources and so for that

132
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
purpose we've developed an iot

133
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,400
portal for resource owners but also for

134
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,720
device manufacturers who want to make it

135
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,160
easy for people who purchase their

136
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,040
devices

137
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
to advertise their data practices and

138
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,199
their privacy options

139
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
and also for volunteer computers and

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
together with this

141
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
our platform this iot portal that we've

142
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,320
developed

143
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,960
we've also developed a mobile app that

144
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,759
people

145
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
as they go about their regular

146
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
whereabouts can use to discover

147
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,400
iot resources collecting their data

148
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,759
nearby

149
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
along with privacy options that these

150
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
resources might be

151
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,199
making available to you and so this

152
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,560
infrastructure that we're going to be

153
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,440
talking about

154
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,120
is really the combination of these two

155
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,639
pieces of technology

156
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,400
the portal through which you can

157
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
describe resources and start publicizing

158
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,360
their presence and their data practices

159
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
and this mobile app that's going to

160
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
enable you to discover

161
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,520
iot resources nearby whether it's based

162
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,639
on your location

163
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,440
or by taking a snapshot of a qr code

164
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,400
that has been

165
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
placed by someone who deployed these

166
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
technologies

167
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,320
the portal itself supports functionality

168
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,400
that's intended to make it very easy for

169
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
people to describe

170
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
resources that they're deploying whether

171
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,680
it's a ring doorbell at your home

172
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,400
or whether it's that location tracking

173
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
system that you might be deploying in a

174
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,880
mall

175
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
or perhaps some kind of uh you know

176
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,240
system

177
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
that's going to rely on facial

178
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,320
recognition to pop up coupons as you

179
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
i watch different items in our stores at

180
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
the mall

181
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
obviously there are many different types

182
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
of scenarios out there

183
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,120
this very same portal is also intended

184
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,680
to be used by device manufacturers

185
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
the manufacturer of that ring doorbell

186
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
might want to make it very easy again

187
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,960
for people

188
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,440
to publicize the presence of their ring

189
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
doorbell you see today people putting

190
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,080
signs

191
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,479
in their lawn or potentially signs on

192
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,440
their door

193
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
why not make it possible for people to

194
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
discover these ring doorbells

195
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,199
through their cell phone for instance

196
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,639
and so rather than

197
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,400
asking people to obviously read the

198
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
entire privacy policy

199
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,919
of these devices why not have device

200
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,039
manufacturers

201
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,199
actually creating templates describing

202
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,560
these resources and then

203
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
someone who purchases one of those

204
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
devices gets to

205
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
instantiate that template by just

206
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
specifying where that

207
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
ring doorbell has been installed

208
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,120
so when it comes to publicizing the

209
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
presence of these resources we need to

210
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,440
cater

211
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
to a few different roles you've got

212
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
obviously the owners of these resources

213
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,720
like the person who purchased

214
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
the ring doorbell and installed it in

215
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,759
their home

216
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,680
you've got also people who might just

217
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,120
want to report the presence of a

218
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,639
resource that is spotted

219
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,039
like let's say a camera at a traffic

220
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,400
light or what have you

221
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,759
and so we really wanted to make it

222
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,199
possible for these volunteer

223
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,080
contributors

224
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,720
to also participate and take advantage

225
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,599
of our

226
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,000
portal and then we also wanted to

227
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
recognize the fact that in many

228
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
situations

229
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
you will have organizations that will

230
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
want to centralize the management of

231
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,400
many of these descriptions

232
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,240
whether that's it's it's that small

233
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
operator that we're talking about

234
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,880
earlier whether it's a corporation or

235
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,520
someone

236
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,240
who's managing a building or a potential

237
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,199
university

238
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,360
or even a neighborhood many of these

239
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,919
ring doorbells today are organized also

240
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,400
in terms of neighborhoods and finally

241
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,360
obviously also

242
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,280
device manufacturers as i described

243
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
earlier who would want to publicize

244
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,120
templates uh and when it comes to users

245
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
right on the other side side of of this

246
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,199
we wanted to enable them

247
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,599
to then take advantage of all these

248
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,080
descriptions that are being publicized

249
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
and discover very quickly and through a

250
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,759
uniform interface again

251
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,440
just in the same manner as you would be

252
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
able to do today with

253
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
mobile apps on your smartphones discover

254
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
through that single interface

255
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,080
nearby resources based for instance on

256
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,199
the types of data

257
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
that are being collected by all these

258
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
devices based on perhaps

259
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,879
whether or not the data collect is

260
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
personally identifiable

261
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,199
as well as other attributes and if you

262
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,479
want to find out more about

263
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,800
one of these devices near your location

264
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
you would want to be able to click on

265
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
one of those pins

266
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,360
and that get perhaps more information

267
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
such as finding out that

268
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,919
in this particular area there is in fact

269
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,120
a deployment

270
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,919
of those shot putter spotter acoustic

271
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,799
devices

272
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,880
that have been used to pinpoint the

273
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,560
location of gunshots

274
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,320
and if you want to find out more you

275
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,680
would want through your mobile app

276
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,160
to be able to also look at additional

277
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
details about the practices

278
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
of these resources not just what data

279
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,399
they collect but also the purpose for

280
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,440
that collection

281
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,480
retention time who can access this data

282
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,000
and uh if these resources were to

283
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,720
provide you

284
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,440
also with some privacy options

285
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
shotspotter doesn't but other resources

286
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,640
such as the

287
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,000
uh bluetooth tracking device

288
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
that is deployed in our lab and that's

289
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
being illustrated here

290
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
on this final screenshot you would want

291
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,120
to

292
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,839
make these privacy options available to

293
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,399
user

294
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
through a screen where then they could

295
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,320
engage with these privacy options

296
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
and exercise a choice that are being

297
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,680
made available

298
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,320
to them so when you design an

299
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
infrastructure like this one

300
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,720
with a platform and a portal to support

301
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,200
resource owners and registry owners and

302
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
device manufacturers

303
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,160
and when you want to support also lay

304
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,680
users and enable them

305
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,920
to discover all these iot resources

306
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
around us that collect

307
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
our data there are a number of

308
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
challenges obviously i decided in this

309
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,839
short presentation to just focus on four

310
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,880
of them

311
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
the most obvious one is obviously that

312
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,040
many of these users

313
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
are lay users you cannot expect every

314
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,320
single

315
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,880
user of this infrastructure to be a

316
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,399
privacy professional

317
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,839
occasionally you might have privacy

318
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,480
professionals using a platform for

319
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
instance when it comes to describing

320
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,200
templates yes obviously you would expect

321
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,120
device manufacturers to rely on privacy

322
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,240
professionals

323
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
to build these templates and distribute

324
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,360
them

325
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
but most of the time the person

326
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,040
deploying that ring doorbell

327
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
or even the person that's going to be

328
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
disclosing the presence

329
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,680
of for instance a location tracking

330
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,880
system in a mall

331
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,360
or a system using facial recognition to

332
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
send coupons to people

333
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
that person will not be a privacy

334
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,240
privacy professional and you would want

335
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
to make it very easy for them to still

336
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
be able to take advantage

337
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
of this platform we wanted to

338
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,560
also make sure that this infrastructure

339
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,519
was compatible with requirements of a

340
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,360
variety of different regulations

341
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,160
we do not expect our users to all be

342
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,640
present

343
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
in the same jurisdiction and so on the

344
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
one hand we want it to be

345
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,160
capable of supporting the requirements

346
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
of regulations like gdpr

347
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,880
or ccpa for that matter but we certainly

348
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
did not want to impose those

349
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
requirements on everyone

350
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,720
using our platform and so this means

351
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,920
effectively

352
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
making a number of different options

353
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,120
available to people who describe these

354
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,920
resources

355
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,320
without necessarily requiring that every

356
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,959
one

357
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,760
of these fields be actually populated

358
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,360
for every single resource

359
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,640
being advertised in our infrastructure

360
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
and then obviously we wanted to also

361
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,000
support a rich

362
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,720
set of data subject rights you don't see

363
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,560
too many of those today in an iot

364
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,600
context

365
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
but there are regulations like gdpr or

366
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,040
lack cpa

367
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,000
that truly require making choices

368
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
available to users

369
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
that require that you obtain consent

370
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,399
from that data subject before you start

371
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
collecting for instance that video

372
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
footage

373
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
and that also require people to be able

374
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,279
to request that their data be deleted

375
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,680
or request to receive a copy of their

376
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,440
data and so we wanted to be able to

377
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,320
support

378
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440
a growing number of potential data

379
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,639
subject rights

380
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,240
and then finally in these sorts of

381
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
environments where you're really

382
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
enabling anyone out there to potentially

383
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,480
describe the presence of an iot resource

384
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
and its data practices

385
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,839
including volunteer contributors we

386
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,240
wanted to obviously have mechanisms in

387
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,519
place to discourage

388
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,800
abuse so let's quickly go over some of

389
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,399
these challenges and briefly

390
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,079
outline how some of these things are

391
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,480
being handled i've already talked about

392
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,560
the use of device templates for instance

393
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
and so we are

394
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
starting obviously with a platform that

395
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,839
already contains a number of templates

396
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,839
that people can use to describe various

397
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,120
types of commonly

398
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,440
deployed devices so that they don't have

399
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,200
to read themselves the privacy policy

400
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
and figure out all the details

401
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,959
this includes also functionality as i

402
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,800
said for device manufacturers

403
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,880
who over time we hope we want to provide

404
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
these templates directly

405
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,839
on their own we also provide

406
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,160
functionality to encourage resource

407
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,000
owners and volunteer contributors to

408
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,720
publish

409
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,040
and this includes rich functionality to

410
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,760
manage

411
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
these resources to request that they be

412
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,160
published in registries to review

413
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
also what requests have been submitted

414
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
to registries that you might be managing

415
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
to create your own templates make those

416
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
templates available to others

417
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
and so on and then obviously

418
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
when you are going to be describing a

419
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,680
new template or you're going to create

420
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,760
your own iot resource which some people

421
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,399
do

422
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,079
we wanted to obviously make it possible

423
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,000
for someone to describe

424
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
all the relevant practices that they

425
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
would want to disclose

426
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,160
and so for that reason obviously we are

427
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,680
realized very quickly

428
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
that you should not expect these people

429
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,240
to be privacy experts as i said earlier

430
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
instead we've developed wizards that are

431
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,279
going to

432
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,880
basically do a lot of hand-holding

433
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
working people through the various steps

434
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,279
involved

435
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,440
in disclosing relevant practices also

436
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,320
disclosing

437
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
where the resource is being deployed

438
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
what uh coverage

439
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
that resource has what privacy options

440
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,480
it might be making available

441
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
to users and the like and supporting a

442
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,639
number of different options

443
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,120
through a fairly comprehensive set of

444
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,000
drop-down

445
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,240
menus without expecting people to be

446
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,760
able to come up with these things

447
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,600
on their own and then when it comes to

448
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,040
those users who are going to be

449
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,880
discovering all these resources

450
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,360
uh through their smartphones or their

451
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
smartwatch this is also

452
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,519
supported on smartwatches we wanted to

453
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,199
enable people to

454
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
specify what types of things they wanted

455
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
to be notified about

456
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
because i think we all realize there are

457
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,399
billions of iot devices

458
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,399
already deployed out there and if you

459
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,160
are to be notified all the time about

460
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
everything that's out there and every

461
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,760
camera that you pass in front

462
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,279
you would find this to probably be

463
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,959
extremely extremely annoying

464
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,040
and so we're providing people with the

465
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,720
ability to customize what they're going

466
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
to be notified about

467
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
whether they want to be notified about

468
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
the presence of resources every time or

469
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,560
perhaps just the first time they

470
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,360
encounter

471
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,480
or never whether it's only uh personally

472
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
identifiable information being collected

473
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
that they want to be notified about

474
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,680
what type of data do they want to be

475
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,760
notified about is it only visual data is

476
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,000
it

477
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,079
audio data are those kinds of things

478
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,440
obviously very important

479
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,199
if you want to enable people to

480
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,720
customize these environments

481
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,800
and ensure that they are informed just

482
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,199
about those things that they care about

483
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,199
jurisdiction agnostic as i mentioned

484
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,279
earlier

485
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,000
we want to support users in a variety of

486
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,519
different jurisdictions

487
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,320
we do not want to impose on people

488
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,480
jurisdictions that perhaps do not apply

489
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,199
to them

490
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,600
we want to leave it to people to decide

491
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,399
what

492
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,639
they want to comply with and whether or

493
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,800
not potentially they want to go beyond

494
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,199
the requirements that might apply to the

495
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,800
jurisdiction where they're deploying a

496
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,600
resource

497
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,079
and so for those reasons we've developed

498
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,680
a fairly comprehensive set

499
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,639
of options that enable people to comply

500
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,959
with many of the requirements of these

501
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,240
regulations such as gdpr or ccpa

502
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,880
but at the same time we're not requiring

503
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
that every one of those fields

504
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,959
be completed instead many of these

505
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,399
fields are optional we leave it to

506
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,680
people to decide

507
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
which one of those they want to complete

508
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
but we make them accountable

509
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,440
and so how do we do that well basically

510
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,560
we're telling people look

511
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,399
if you're going to publish this resource

512
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,600
please confirm

513
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,199
that you take responsibility for what

514
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,959
you're publishing please confirm that

515
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,560
this data is accurate

516
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,320
please confirm that you understand the

517
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
regulations under which you have to

518
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
operate and if you do

519
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,360
then you know go for it we're just going

520
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,279
to facilitate that process but we're not

521
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,160
going to take responsibility for that

522
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
and so finally when it comes to

523
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,360
supporting a wide range of

524
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,680
rights subjects right data subject

525
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,040
rights

526
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,160
the key here is to obviously not try to

527
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,920
manage these rights yourself

528
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,480
right we do not control all these

529
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,759
different devices that are out there

530
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
we're not in a position

531
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,160
to actually implement choices that our

532
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,600
users would want to select

533
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,440
but we want to certainly facilitate the

534
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,199
discovery of these choices

535
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,319
enable people to connect to those

536
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,079
technologies that will enable them to

537
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,280
specify their settings their preferences

538
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,359
whether it's opt-in whether it's opt-out

539
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,760
deletion portability or what have you

540
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,240
and so this is supported through uh

541
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,959
basically an open collection of apis

542
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,039
uh and these apis then connect to

543
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,720
various types of consent management

544
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,000
platforms so that

545
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,160
anyone who is interested in advertising

546
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,280
an api

547
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
has the ability to do so by specifying

548
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,559
the url

549
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,280
and enabling them to also do third party

550
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
authentication

551
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
so that they make sure we see that those

552
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
people who are exercising those rights

553
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,360
are indeed who they claim to be

554
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
discouraging abuse we've already touched

555
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,720
on that so this includes obviously

556
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
authenticating users

557
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,480
we support volunteer contributors i

558
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,880
think that they can add a lot of value

559
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,240
in helping us populate this

560
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
infrastructure but we also expect them

561
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,080
to take responsibility

562
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,720
we also support a highly decentralized

563
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,240
publication mechanisms

564
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,799
where we expect registry owners whether

565
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,000
small operators

566
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,880
campus operators neighborhood

567
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
associations or homeowners

568
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,200
those are people that will be

569
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,960
effectively

570
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,400
uh organizing many resources that are

571
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,559
related to a given community

572
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,520
a given place they're responsible for

573
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,160
curating

574
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,000
all these resources they have the

575
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,919
ability to impose their own policies

576
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,640
about

577
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
how they're going to be vetting those

578
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160
publication requests what they're going

579
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,440
to be vetting

580
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,280
they've got the ability to take these uh

581
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
requests down that to turn down these

582
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,400
requests but also

583
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
take down things that have been

584
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,480
published if someone to modify one of

585
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,200
these

586
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,520
resource descriptions and are proven to

587
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,640
potentially be

588
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,200
uh advertising information that's are

589
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
clearly not correct

590
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,360
as platform operators we ourselves also

591
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,559
have the ability

592
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,640
to take down resources so that's in a

593
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,919
nutshell uh

594
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,840
a quick summary of the challenges that

595
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,200
we've had to deal with

596
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,039
uh this was this platform this

597
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,480
infrastructure was released

598
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,280
earlier this year we got about 17 000

599
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
downloads in just the first week

600
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,720
today we're approaching about two

601
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,960
hundred thousand iot resources

602
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,200
and a new version of uh this

603
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
infrastructure

604
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,240
will be made available just around the

605
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,919
time that you're going to be listening

606
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,760
to this talk so here's a quick

607
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,080
video advertising our infrastructure

608
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,000
filled with technology that tracks more

609
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,360
data about you

610
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,440
and most of the time you can't even see

611
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,039
them so that's why

612
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,919
the internet of things assistant is here

613
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,760
it will help you have greater privacy

614
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,720
and control

615
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,960
of data collected about you the

616
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,039
assistant lives on a vibrant yet

617
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,400
familiar interface

618
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,480
that uses a map to show nearby data

619
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,600
collection

620
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,919
by tapping on a ping you can easily

621
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,600
learn more about a device

622
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,559
and even control what data is collected

623
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,799
with our new notifications feature

624
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,960
you'll be notified of any devices that

625
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
you come in contact with

626
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,520
you can even customize when and what you

627
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,320
want to be notified for now

628
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,640
being notified about data collection has

629
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
never been easier

630
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,320
the internet of things assistant is

631
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
available on the apple app store and

632
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,760
google play store now

633
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,840
and we hope to see you there

634
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,880
and this concludes my presentation so

635
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
thank you very much and uh feel free to
