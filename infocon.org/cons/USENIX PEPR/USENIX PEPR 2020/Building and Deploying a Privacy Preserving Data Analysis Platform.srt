1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,840
hey everyone

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
my name is robert janssen i'm the

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,200
director of the software and application

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,599
racial lab at boston university and also

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,440
cp broadway thanks party which is a

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,199
startup in the umtc space

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,960
my talk today will be on building and

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,560
applying privacy preserving data

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,760
analysis platform

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
which happens throughout the web for

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,039
those of you who

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,359
do not know ntc or secure multi-party

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,320
communication

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,719
this is a field of cryptography of

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,840
cryptography which

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,160
allows you to compute a function on

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,480
private inputs without revealing those

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
inputs you can really perform any

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,079
computation

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,440
and there is no guarantee that your

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,800
public output has no inference to your

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,920
private interest

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,879
so it's a really powerful technology but

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,920
at the same time

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
unlike for example differential privacy

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,480
which also exists in the same space of

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,719
privacy enhancing technologies it does

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,840
not guarantee

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,879
pro-level animation for example and you

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,080
know there are other

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
tools and technologies that i would

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,119
consider to be

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,600
complementary to npc in the space of

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,400
pregnancy advancing technologies

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
we've been really fortunate to be able

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,159
to work mostly on social good

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,680
applications in this space

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
our first project and the one that i'll

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,360
be referencing this talk

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,880
is the one for the boston

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
we also deployed the same platform for

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,880
the greater boston chamber of commerce

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,159
or economic inclusion

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,520
but we've worked on other projects in

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,439
the epc space including

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,840
working with startups like charlie um

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
opioid addiction our cognitive

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,240
multiplication

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,479
than project callisto which was a

50
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,479
project for detecting zero perpetrators

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,759
of sexual misconduct

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,119
we're currently working with a local

53
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,119
startup on bankruptcy

54
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,880
to allow banks to use private living

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,799
recession to be able to share

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,960
certain bits and pieces of information

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
on suspected

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
suspected bank brothers

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,399
maybe a little bit of the history of npc

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,000
it was discovered in the

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
late was 1970s published first

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
in within that timeframe and then it

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,840
took

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
about 30 years before the first real

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,959
opponent happened

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,280
so we're talking 2008 through very

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
famous sugar means auction

68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
during spain's in the apc space

69
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,599
and then nothing happened for a couple

70
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,280
of years

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
this might be deployment this might be a

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
simulation and sometimes you look at it

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,160
but then there's a series of deployments

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
that that my very small team

75
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,319
is responsible for so we've deployed the

76
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,360
web-based platform

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,519
it's almost a dozen times right now and

78
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,720
we're very proud of the work that you've

79
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
done but at the same time it is somewhat

80
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,120
sad and telling of

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
the industry that it took so long and

82
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,040
that

83
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,640
are so few deployments

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
of npc um i think it's kind of

85
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,560
you know maybe it's this thoughtful show

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
my sense is that a lot of it has to do

87
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,040
with with

88
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
accessibility and making sure that you

89
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
build tools that are actually usable

90
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
for people at some point we were

91
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,040
responsible for i would

92
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,280
imagine more than half of the worldwide

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,400
interesting deployments

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,640
one notable exception here is 2017

95
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,239
google launch predictive typing on

96
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:16,879
android

97
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,000
and uses npc for secure aggregation and

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
locally now however the landscape is a

99
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,200
little bit different there seems to be a

100
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
lot more traction around utc

101
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,560
these are some of the locals you can see

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
alliance members and so these are all

103
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,879
folks

104
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,599
who are either using a pc or are

105
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,519
developing products in the upcc space so

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,879
hopefully distraction lasts

107
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,400
because i do believe that it is very

108
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,599
powerful and promising technology

109
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
maybe said on the stage a little bit for

110
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,440
the platform that we built

111
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,720
so back in the early 2010s

112
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
mayor menino in boston came up with

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
an idea to make the greater boston area

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,239
the premiere place for working women

115
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,720
in america and one of the pillars of

116
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,439
this project

117
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,120
was closing the ratio in order to do so

118
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
he needed to be able to measure the

119
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,599
ratio and then see if the programs that

120
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,560
were inactive

121
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,519
actually helped close the ratio and for

122
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,319
that happened

123
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,680
you need to be able to collect this kind

124
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
of data so

125
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,639
they ran into a snag not so long after

126
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,798
for two reasons one that trusts the

127
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,639
third party that they identified

128
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,800
backed out and said you know collecting

129
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
all of this data into clear

130
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
is just the legal liability and if

131
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,840
something happens if this data leaks we

132
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,960
don't want to get sued

133
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,479
and the members who are participating in

134
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,479
this program said well

135
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
this is proprietary information we don't

136
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,919
really want to share this data with

137
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,440
anyone else we're happy to

138
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,080
you know participate in this kind of

139
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,880
computation

140
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,320
but we don't really want to we don't

141
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
really want to send our individual data

142
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,880
to

143
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
to anyone so my boss at the time

144
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
professor designers

145
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,199
knew of npc that's something that he

146
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,800
learned about back in

147
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
his college days and he thought that

148
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
this could could be

149
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,040
a viable solution to to solve this

150
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
problem

151
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,639
so we've identified npc as a potential

152
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,880
solution but now the next challenge is

153
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,479
how do we convince people

154
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,840
that it actually is something that they

155
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
want to participate in and this is

156
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,520
half of our battle you know we have

157
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,280
hundreds of participants who

158
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,720
will be submitting their data or

159
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
participating in this communication

160
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,680
and we want to make sure that they can

161
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,240
do so securely but we also want to make

162
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,759
sure that they understand

163
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,479
what they're getting into and really the

164
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,199
issue here

165
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,639
is you claim that there's this magical

166
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,280
solution

167
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
called npc that you can use to compute

168
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,800
over private data

169
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,639
but people don't have the tuition like

170
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,800
they might have with a little you know

171
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,880
browser icon block that this page is

172
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
secure you know the mtc is so novel

173
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,720
enough that people

174
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
think is this even possible are you

175
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,240
selling me snakehole

176
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,919
and people ask you know is this really

177
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,759
access control are you telling me that

178
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,880
you won't look at the data

179
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
that you actually can look at the data

180
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,080
or is this encryption at rest

181
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,880
where the data is encrypted most of the

182
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,440
time

183
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,800
but when you actually compute on it

184
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,080
obviously you have to encrypt it right

185
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,280
how how else can you

186
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,039
can you compute on the data or what

187
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,479
happens if this data leaks

188
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,199
what happens if you if you get breached

189
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,240
what's the

190
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
you know potential for a bad price once

191
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,479
they cost of us to participate

192
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,840
in this kind of a computation

193
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
because it sounds really technical and

194
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
you know you have the budget to do so

195
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
this is those are one set of questions

196
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
the second set of questions that we

197
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,800
get is or that we received was can i

198
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
actually participate you know maybe my

199
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,440
data is encumbered by

200
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,039
hipaa maybe i'm a government

201
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,960
organization

202
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,360
or for any of this data what's the legal

203
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
liability involved

204
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
which lawyer should i get into the room

205
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
and what kind of ca you have to sign

206
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,759
if i think i'm sending you any data and

207
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,880
so these are all questions

208
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
that we answered in any sort of

209
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
communication effort that we have

210
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
but we also try to give people an

211
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,120
intuition of how qpc works itself

212
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,199
so that they feel like this is a safe

213
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,360
and secure application

214
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,560
so one of the first efforts of

215
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,160
doing so is the following we tell people

216
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
you know you have your data you have 10

217
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,639
you want to compute the aggregate of

218
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,520
everyone's data

219
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
so what you do is you split your data

220
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,280
into two parts the size of this bar

221
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,080
chart

222
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,319
corresponds to the size of the data and

223
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,319
you send one share to one party

224
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
to the other party they have their local

225
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,080
shares they do the sum of

226
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,120
the some of the shares and you end up

227
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,840
with the total

228
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,400
of all the participants without having

229
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
to send data to

230
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,240
anyone this report called for a while

231
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
until someone remarked

232
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,360
are you leaking the lower bounds of the

233
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,840
data

234
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,400
now i send you five i know that the data

235
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
is never going to get my real number

236
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,000
it's never going to be lower than 5.

237
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,759
when we said you know this is a fair

238
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,199
point it's not actually the solution

239
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,840
that we

240
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
that we would be running but we didn't

241
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,520
want to get into

242
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
getting to the risk of trying to explain

243
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,960
fine and healthy to people

244
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,360
and making more complicated things but

245
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
we thought you know maybe it's worth it

246
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,199
let's let's try to find an analogy that

247
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,720
people should know

248
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,319
in the real world you try to see if we

249
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
can explain kind of field earth

250
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
so we came up with clocks you know

251
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
clocks roll around you can add

252
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,560
9 to 12 then you end up with 9 again

253
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,879
so this allows people to do the same

254
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,680
kind of math

255
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,440
but then using clocks and we thought

256
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
this was a good analogy and

257
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
for the most part i think it was ok

258
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
but what ended up happening was even

259
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
though the math works out

260
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,199
people seem to have trouble making the

261
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,159
connection between

262
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,120
clocks and how it really identifies back

263
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,240
to their data

264
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
and even you know even though the math

265
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,519
works they didn't really seem to have

266
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
the same solution of how it works and

267
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,958
end up with more questions

268
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,080
than actually the previous example so in

269
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
the third and final example which is

270
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
what we mainly use these days

271
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,680
we we get around this issue

272
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
by just introducing negative numbers so

273
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,040
we have your actual data

274
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
and we have a random number that

275
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
generate which we call the mask

276
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
this can be positive it's communicative

277
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
the size of these bar charts no longer

278
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
corresponds to the value of the data

279
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,839
minus three and you can't really

280
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,120
represent minus space in this example

281
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
but we do it this way so you send the

282
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,959
mask to one part and using the past data

283
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,240
to the other party

284
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,519
and if you have everything together the

285
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,240
masks cancel out and then you end up

286
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,560
with

287
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
um with a total here as you work in the

288
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
first example

289
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,480
and this works very well people people

290
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,160
don't seem to be questioning this and

291
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
they seem to have an intuition of how

292
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
you can compute that group of data

293
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
that you don't actually have with them

294
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
this is the protocol diagram which we

295
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
show to people

296
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,640
just you know the way the servers are

297
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
set up leaderboards in this case this is

298
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
the data we receive

299
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
this is data the customers council will

300
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,519
receive

301
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,000
some other considerations we only

302
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
explain out of the secret sharing

303
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,240
typically

304
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
even though well we did use the

305
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,360
submission for the first

306
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,200
couple of deployments we no longer do we

307
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
switched to sharing sharing

308
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
but we don't actually for the most part

309
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,640
in your secret sharing or any of the

310
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,040
more

311
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,079
complicated protocols but we do tell

312
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,800
people

313
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,399
you know let's extrapolate from here

314
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,320
like i've shown you how to do addition

315
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,000
but imagine that you can also do there's

316
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,440
a more complicated way of doing

317
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,399
multiplication

318
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,399
and basically any computation and for

319
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,440
the most part people

320
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,640
trust us for those who don't we point to

321
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
some of our larger members state street

322
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
partners healthcare boston university

323
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,920
who have signed up who are signed on to

324
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
to be participants

325
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,920
and we say you know maybe not trust us

326
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,680
but hopefully you'll trust them

327
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,000
which also seems to work very well so

328
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,279
like i mentioned we do have other

329
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,880
variants of presentations

330
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
including your secret sharing which we

331
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,120
really limit to specific audiences

332
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,839
and specific use cases like for example

333
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,560
with

334
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
project callisto which really revolved

335
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
revolves from

336
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,959
your secret sharing so we don't

337
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,959
typically show this to um

338
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,320
let's say c sea level functions another

339
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,440
example that we use

340
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
which is more of an informal example or

341
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
when it's a new person setting

342
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,200
we use birthdays so imagine that you

343
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
have a bunch of people in the room

344
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,160
and you tell them come up with with your

345
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,360
think about your age but lie about it

346
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,760
and tell your neighbor what your fake

347
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
age is and remember by how much you lied

348
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,720
about your age

349
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,079
and then you kind of do this round

350
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,240
brother protocol where everyone

351
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,640
whispers the name or whispers their

352
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,600
takeage

353
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
into the ear of the next person and adds

354
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,959
it up to

355
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,040
their own vacation and then around the

356
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
circle and then the second time

357
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
you subtract on how much you lied about

358
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,160
your page and if you do this

359
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,079
two times then you end up with a total

360
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,920
of everyone's age without ever having to

361
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,560
reveal

362
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
their actual pages and it seems to

363
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,760
resonate while other people they

364
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,200
understand how to protect all words you

365
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
can do with your kids

366
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,839
and it's really easy we do have a lot of

367
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,160
training sessions and handouts for data

368
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,880
submission

369
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
just because we've learned in a very

370
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,720
painful way which i'll talk about later

371
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
as well

372
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,760
that it's a lot easier to spend a couple

373
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
of hours upfront than i just have to

374
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,880
recover from any

375
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,839
data mistakes or entry mistakes under

376
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,959
npc if possible

377
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,279
and then finally something that we

378
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,480
mostly struggle with

379
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
at the start some of the burgess that's

380
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
typical in

381
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
web development maybe in other places as

382
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,120
well doesn't really

383
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,480
work as well for npc like we used to say

384
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
upload your scratching that's also

385
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,920
uncommented i thought i wasn't uploading

386
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,200
my data i thought it would remain

387
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,320
private and secure

388
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,880
and so you're technically not uploading

389
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,399
it but you're participating in this

390
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,920
communication

391
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,959
you know everything happens in the

392
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,560
browser everything happens locally so we

393
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,000
never really see your data

394
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
so we have to switch some of the verges

395
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,440
to to make sure it aligns more

396
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,160
with npc even though it's not perfect

397
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,440
then there's still words that

398
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,000
you know are hard to change just because

399
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
that's what people are used to like the

400
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,839
buttons

401
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,279
so we've gotten this far people seem to

402
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,720
understand

403
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,839
now it's a question of building

404
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,839
something that they can actually use

405
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,880
and we decided to build a custom

406
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,320
solution

407
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,399
not necessarily initially by choice but

408
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,600
just because we thought it was

409
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,000
the best way of moving forward actually

410
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,800
initially

411
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,279
we wanted to speak with with a vendor in

412
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,240
this space

413
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
who had a commercial solution and we

414
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
told them what we wanted to do and they

415
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,760
said oh we have the perfect product for

416
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,720
you

417
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,880
we will give you a vm you add your

418
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,399
algorithm to it you send it to your

419
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,360
participants

420
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,399
they install it on your cloud

421
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,240
environment they look into their data

422
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,120
storage

423
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,839
they open up some ports in their

424
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,160
firewall and everyone's ready

425
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
you flip the switch they all participate

426
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,600
in a computation

427
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,440
that'll be really fast and you'll get

428
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,959
your results and we said

429
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,320
you know this is great but i don't think

430
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
it's going to work because

431
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,839
we have banks in the hospitals that are

432
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,440
participating and they're not going to

433
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,839
launch

434
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,600
install finders onto their cloud

435
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
environment um

436
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,600
you know we want something that probably

437
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
just works on the web

438
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,760
because the other part of our

439
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
participants are startups and and they

440
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,560
don't even have

441
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
environments they would never be able to

442
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,079
install vm they don't have an xt

443
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,839
department

444
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,880
and and they said well you know that's

445
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,519
not really

446
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,959
that's not really what we do and we

447
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,199
don't take that mpc on the web is a good

448
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
idea in the first place

449
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,560
and i understand why it doesn't work for

450
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,160
their business model but at the same

451
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
time going back to july hasn't been

452
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,880
received and deployed

453
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
i think it's exactly this right it's

454
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
it's because

455
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,160
solutions have been built that might

456
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,240
work in a business business setting

457
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,639
but you know we'll never get traction if

458
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,000
you want to work with 140

459
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
separate businesses at the same time

460
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,959
that all want to participate in the

461
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,800
confrontation

462
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,199
so we built our our own web-based

463
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:37,920
platform

464
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,279
version one arguably was not very great

465
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,800
it worked for the most part didn't have

466
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,320
problems with data validation

467
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,519
results background later in the version

468
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,519
three at this point which really has

469
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,760
been user tested we've done user studies

470
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,399
using

471
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
turret we've only be testing we try to

472
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,920
make it as seamless as possible

473
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,000
where people only have to click a link

474
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
drag and drop in the spreadsheet

475
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,680
and that's it they submit and they

476
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
participate in their compensation

477
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
it has expensive error checking and

478
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,600
validation

479
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,560
on the front end just because we've

480
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,399
noticed it's really easy to that finger

481
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,720
number maybe they report you know data

482
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,480
adding extra zero to their data

483
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,399
and because it's fbc it's really

484
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,600
impossible but it's really

485
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,480
difficult to discover and recover from

486
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,199
these kinds of

487
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,399
mistakes we also built more analytics on

488
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,199
their pc

489
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,720
we could have used google analytics but

490
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
we wanted to you know have the same

491
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,399
level of privacy

492
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
so we built tools like having a heat

493
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,560
pack that's computed under npc

494
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,079
to hopefully improve the usability of

495
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,279
the platform

496
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,600
okay so we've built a platform we

497
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
convinced people that

498
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,720
is a great solution what else keeps this

499
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
or me at least

500
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
awake and this is really a difficult

501
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,759
question because it's more of a

502
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
philosophical one than a technical one

503
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,680
as i mentioned before npc allows you to

504
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
run inquiry but it makes no guarantees

505
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,759
that you can't infer from the result of

506
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,720
that query

507
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
what the data was even though the data

508
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
is supposed to be so some of these

509
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,519
decisions are easy to make

510
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,360
right we don't allow we typically don't

511
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
allow queries that would

512
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,680
reveal a single group and we also don't

513
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,320
allow

514
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,880
repeated queries if the data slightly

515
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,600
changes

516
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
right if we have 100 participants when

517
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,360
we perform the computation

518
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
and then there's a straggler number one

519
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,720
hundred and one we don't allow them in

520
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,079
the conversation anymore

521
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,959
if you've already run

522
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,399
other questions are a little bit more

523
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,519
complicated to

524
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,519
answer how many participants do you

525
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,639
actually need to

526
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,880
guarantee privacy and what does privacy

527
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,399
mean in this case

528
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,440
well it depends on the data that you're

529
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,079
collecting

530
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,639
the query that you're running and it's

531
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,880
the case by key spaces that we

532
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
basically talk about every single time

533
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,959
we perform a deployment

534
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,440
this is what it means for people's data

535
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,639
to be private

536
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
we made a decision very early on to make

537
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,800
sure that all participants are anonymous

538
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,079
we actually don't know

539
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,640
who participated which works well but at

540
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
the same time the analyst actually

541
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,160
wants to know who participated because

542
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
it helps them to

543
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
to encourage more people to participate

544
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,359
right if you can email

545
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,119
the single partner and say hey i've

546
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,480
noticed that you haven't submitted your

547
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,359
data

548
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,959
that would really help their numbers and

549
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,880
make sure they have as large

550
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,439
as users um as possible so if we make

551
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,799
that change in the consideration of the

552
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,439
platform

553
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,119
now we have to rethink the previous

554
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,480
question how many participants do you

555
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,440
actually need

556
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,760
and then lastly maybe not lastly good

557
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,799
lesson on the slide

558
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,760
which algorithms are appropriate some

559
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,400
let's say you want to do medium

560
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
we say you have no single row results

561
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,919
but maybe this would be fine

562
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,880
if your participants are numerous at the

563
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,760
same time

564
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
because of the makeup of the data in our

565
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
case salary data

566
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,520
you might be able to identify even if

567
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,200
the participants are anonymous by just

568
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,559
looking at the row you might be able to

569
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,360
identify which

570
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
specific company this is talking about

571
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,360
because they have a very

572
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
you know very specific makeup of this

573
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,799
little board

574
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,520
which you could infer from that result

575
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,039
if it so happens to be the company that

576
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:07,360
you

577
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,039
that you not differential privacy

578
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,440
could be a solution here and and it's

579
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,320
something that we

580
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,640
definitely are leading to see if we can

581
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,160
support the combination of differential

582
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,799
privacy in

583
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,799
pc but unfortunately for this particular

584
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,039
use case it doesn't look like our

585
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,320
data maker is very well suitable for

586
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,240
differential privacy just because it

587
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
would you know mostly ruin the accuracy

588
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
of

589
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,320
the data and then finally maybe more for

590
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
your pressure than your mind all these

591
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,960
things that you messed up

592
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,600
the point one i've mentioned we can

593
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,120
properly validate data people

594
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,240
appointment two worked a lot better but

595
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,600
we didn't do any sort of semantic

596
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,320
validation

597
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,039
where you could enter a salary for a

598
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:53,679
person

599
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,960
while at the same time saying that they

600
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
were zero months which wasn't valid

601
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,440
and so we had some discrepancies in the

602
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,880
data and

603
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,400
had a report on it in that way

604
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,120
this effort i think we've learned over

605
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,679
time

606
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,520
that it's oftentimes better to cut

607
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,039
people off

608
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
instead of trying to do this effort if

609
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,039
you if you suspect that people are

610
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,799
having trouble submitting data

611
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,520
or you know maybe if they've generated

612
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
too many error messages

613
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,600
at that point it seems to be better to

614
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,720
completely cut them out of the

615
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,520
computation

616
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,120
just because the risk of having been

617
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,000
validated at that point is too large

618
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,840
and then the final two are kind of um

619
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,240
we have definitely messed up assuming

620
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
the wrong lower bounds

621
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,240
so our prime wasn't large enough and

622
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,840
people couldn't submit

623
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,880
and then when we when we fixed this or

624
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,679
we fixed this

625
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,520
initially by saying let's just report in

626
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,799
thousands of dollars

627
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,840
so that you know our data is a lot

628
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,000
smaller

629
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
and then at some point we checked this

630
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,280
for consistency stage someone

631
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,200
would think or at least one person

632
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
submitted whole dollars

633
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,000
we should have submitted thousands of

634
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,919
dollars so the end result was not by

635
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,360
effectively thousands

636
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,600
and we were able to fix this under pc we

637
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,360
know participants and told them

638
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,880
what had happened we we coded up a new

639
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,600
algorithm

640
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
that obliviously were looked at for

641
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,120
obliviously were divided by

642
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,360
thousands if the data was larger than a

643
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,480
threshold

644
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,039
and this worked but it did leak the

645
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,400
magnitude of the data

646
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,559
um we're still happy that that we were

647
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,720
able to to recover on their pc which was

648
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,760
a great use case for

649
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,159
the platform that we built but at the

650
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,440
same time

651
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,159
you know not necessarily the limitation

652
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,520
of npc

653
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,159
we find that most of these issues result

654
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:38,720
from

655
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,039
core planning poor assumptions on rns

656
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,480
and

657
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,000
just bad practices general best

658
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,039
practices in software engineering

659
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
thank you um college obviously this

660
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,720
wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for

661
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,360
a very

662
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
large and dedicated team that have been

663
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,400
working on this for

664
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:03,840
many many years thank you

665
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,158
you
