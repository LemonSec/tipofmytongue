00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,840
hi

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,759
i'm dan crowley i'm the global head of

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,759
trust and safety and data protection at

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,799
quizlet

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,640
for those of you who aren't familiar

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,560
quizfit is an education technology and

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
learning platform that serves over 50

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,080
million students and teachers every

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,039
month

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,439
what i'd like to talk about today is how

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
we built the privacy and safety program

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,480
at quizlet

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,199
in a small growing organization and

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,880
effectively threw out our

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,600
the old classic checklist and replaced

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
it with a privacy by ethos culture

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,000
to begin i'd like to bring us back 20

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
years to when scott mcneely

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
famously declared you have zero privacy

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,760
anyway get over it

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,920
well he was primarily talking about

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
governmental overreach

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,039
the reality is that privacy interest

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,239
didn't go away for anyone not the public

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,440
and not for regulators

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
and so what we've seen over the last 20

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,519
years is an increase in enforcement

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
actions and interest in privacy

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,520
certainly by regulators

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,600
who as we can see have dramatically

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
increased their enforcement

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,840
of data privacy rights but also by the

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,400
public

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
who've increased their understanding

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,000
enforcement from regulators comes not

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,560
only in the form of tangible fines

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,520
but also in new regulation like the gdpr

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,479
which establishes

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,079
new and higher standards of

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,240
accountability for companies who process

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
personal information

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,040
but regulators didn't just leave us with

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,079
fines

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,479
and new administrative burdens they also

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,320
left us with a framework

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,520
the privacy by design framework

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,280
this framework has seven core principles

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,600
the privacy should be proactive not

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,479
reactive

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
there should be strong default settings

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,640
it should be embedded into

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,119
not bolted onto the processes and

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,320
products

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
of these businesses privacy can be

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,079
positive some

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,560
it's not a zero-sum game there needs to

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,318
be end-to-end security

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,560
we should have openness and transparency

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
and fundamentally

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,319
we need to build respect and demonstrate

61
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,440
that respect

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
for the user companies took that to

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,400
heart

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,800
and it seems simple enough clear

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
concepts

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
and we've seen this explosion of privacy

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,680
tooling

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,000
privacy advocacy groups privacy

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,879
advisories in the last decade

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,879
but we're still all here at this

71
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
conference trying to figure out

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,000
how do we effectively make privacy work

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
for our companies

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,319
and for our users

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,080
we know what good programs look like

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,120
don't we i think we've all seen them

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,360
triage questionnaires your privacy

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,480
impact assessments

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
your dpias your policy approvals your

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
risk assessments vendors certifications

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,840
audits controls

83
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,480
matrices but is that the right answer

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,280
for every company at every point in time

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,560
i'm not sure because what we've also

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,360
seen

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,760
are similar pitfalls across all of those

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,800
established privacy processes

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
these are common issues that we've

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,360
almost all certainly run up against

91
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
we lack visibility and access and

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,560
frankly

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,599
we can't fix what we don't see sometimes

94
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,680
we lack resources

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
we can sometimes have small undermanned

96
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,799
teams and there's only 24 hours in a day

97
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,200
we can run into politics how do you

98
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
avoid being the blocker

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,159
and then fundamentally is there a clash

100
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,440
of cultures

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,480
when we look to add process

102
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,760
what a lot of teams hear are delays

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,239
and when they hear delays they hear less

104
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,840
impact

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,080
is that something that we can actually

106
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,519
overcome

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,239
with just the classic good program

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,879
processes

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,400
one thing that i've learned especially

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
at quizlet is that these issues can be

111
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,599
especially acute

112
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,920
in small and rapidly growing

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,639
organizations

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,000
so what do you do take that checklist

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,359
and throw it right in the trash

116
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,840
the single most impactful thing you can

117
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,440
do as your company's

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,000
privacy person is turn everyone else

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
into a privacy person too

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,880
it's not the document you write it's not

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,360
the controls that you build in

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
it's not the uh the triage

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,800
questionnaires that you fill out

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
it's leaving behind a culture that

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
understands privacy

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,600
that respects privacy and encourages

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,320
other people to build it into their

128
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,120
daily lives

129
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,759
now it's probably too much when i say

130
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,840
throw out the checklist entirely

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
because there's absolutely a time and

132
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
place for it but especially if you're in

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,520
a small and growing organization

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,000
keep that checklist for yourself figure

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
out what are the policies you need how

136
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
are you going to organize your data maps

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,600
your records your assessments that's

138
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,560
what's important

139
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,280
to begin with for that checklist for

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,479
everyone else

141
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,080
focus on culture and ask questions

142
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,400
why does privacy matter what are our

143
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,440
principles

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,639
when you're working with a team

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,240
developing a new feature or a new

146
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,039
product

147
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,160
or integrating a new vendor ask

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,400
what could go wrong but more importantly

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,280
what more could go right

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
step back and invite them into a

151
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,479
conversation

152
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
about what do our users expect of us

153
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,919
and lastly what can they as the product

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,560
manager

155
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,160
engineer designer what can you

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
teach me because privacy

157
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,360
is a multi-factored cross-functional

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
skill and it cannot be solved by any one

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,319
team or one organization

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,039
everyone has something to contribute and

161
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,400
everyone needs to feel like they're a

162
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,840
valued part of the conversation

163
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,720
this is how you build a privacy by ethos

164
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
culture

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
and so some other tips that we've

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,919
learned are make it fun

167
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,000
as simple as that sounds it's the single

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
most important thing you can do

169
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
your program is determined by a

170
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,919
checklist it's as fragile as the person

171
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,479
least likely to follow it i think we all

172
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,520
know someone

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
who's not very high on that list have

174
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,960
prizes

175
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,000
have games do whatever you can to make

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,280
sure people understand

177
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,720
you're not there to be the boring

178
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
compliance person you're there to add

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
value and add to the culture

180
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,759
at quizlet we made literal hats with

181
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,440
trust and safety on them that we left in

182
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
every conference room

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
so that any team member could literally

184
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
put on their trust and safety hat

185
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
in any product or business meeting they

186
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,319
were having

187
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,520
we also gamified fishing exercises

188
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
turning them into not a compliance

189
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,919
training but something fun

190
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,960
and interesting for everyone

191
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,240
start early so often

192
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,800
teams get lost bigger things don't go

193
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,680
right because teams start too late

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
and that can be the development cycle

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
but that's also building your own

196
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,919
culture

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,960
be consistent and be present especially

198
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
in these crazy coveted times it can be

199
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,560
really challenging

200
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
to build the meaningful relationships

201
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,199
that help privacy work

202
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,080
make the time find the time to have your

203
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,599
zoom coffee chats

204
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,720
to have your lunch and learns

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
to have your presentations and make sure

206
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
that your teams know that you are there

207
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,919
and you're available invite

208
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,120
conversations

209
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
when we talk about those questions it's

210
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
not just about encouraging the team to

211
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,919
think

212
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,199
it's about making sure that they

213
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,720
understand that they're a valued

214
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,759
contributor

215
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,560
to the privacy process and that the only

216
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,400
way that you can help them

217
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,599
is by them helping you

218
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,639
real-life rewards work as silly as it

219
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,599
seems

220
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,479
tangible things like little statues or

221
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,840
stuffed animals

222
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
that give real world recognition when

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
people do things right

224
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,199
make a real difference in building this

225
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
culture

226
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,039
and i would the last and maybe most

227
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,000
important thing is

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,520
use what's already there to your

229
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,080
advantage you have an existing business

230
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,039
culture

231
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,399
what about it helps your privacy program

232
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
what about it is transferable one of the

233
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
values we have at quizlet is teach

234
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,519
yourself something new

235
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,440
as an education company this makes a lot

236
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
of sense but it's also been incredible

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
incredibly useful for me to be able to

238
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,200
leverage

239
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,279
learning something new and introducing a

240
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,200
new area that certain people may not be

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
as comfortable with

242
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,600
another cultural value at quizlet is

243
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,399
being

244
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,600
humble candid and open asking those

245
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
questions and asking to be taught about

246
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
what the technology does

247
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,760
is a sign of humility and then giving

248
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,560
clear

249
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,040
meaningful feedback helps be open and

250
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
candid with the teams

251
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,640
about what the risks of their choices

252
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,440
might be

253
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
but also the opportunities that might be

254
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,760
there as well

255
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,760
by combining all these things together

256
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
you can set yourself up for success in

257
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,320
the long run

258
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,440
by making sure that your privacy program

259
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
when it gets to the point where you need

260
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
the longer checklist

261
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
is set up for success culturally in your

262
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,160
company

263
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
and in the short term it makes sure that

264
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,560
you have more boots on the ground

265
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
because when everyone understands and

266
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,560
values privacy you're no longer a team

267
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,760
of one or two

268
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,080
your team of the entire company thank

269
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,839
you look forward to your questions
