00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,440
hello

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,160
everybody the thought of this talk is

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,719
pro

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,480
product grant's journey towards a

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,079
product centric privacy engineer

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,440
framework

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,199
in stock we are going to discuss

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,279
challenge of embedding privacy into the

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,960
product creation process

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,519
how privacy principles have helped

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,560
consumers

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,080
and how those principles can be

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
translated in product requirements

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
my name is igor and i am a technology

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,160
partner at a company called

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,880
working hall where i work closely with

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,440
products

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,239
design engineering teams across several

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,079
projects to help them to

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,640
conceptualize and design successful

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,000
product strategies

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,239
with privacy as competitive advantage

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,120
you may be wondering why a

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,440
product-centric approach instead of

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,480
a compliance design

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,919
engineering or even user focus

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
the main reason is when

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,760
embedding privacy into product

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
development it must be a return to

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
renaissance

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,200
a dissection of ideas fields

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
and groups towards the same goal hardly

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,960
need product developments any works done

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
by a single group

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,640
the engineering team must work in unison

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,680
with design

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,600
products and even compliance teams

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,920
so in the end it is about having

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,600
technology

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,840
[Music]

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,720
pms designers

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
all of them working together sharing

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,079
responsibilities

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,439
again it's not about the user group

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,119
efforts everything

46
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,360
important it's really important to have

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,759
this in mind

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
and everything matters all the groups

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,520
matters all the ideas matters to create

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,880
great products with incredible

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
experience

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
okay cool so if any of you

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
ever worked with product development you

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,640
know

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,239
it is all about product principles

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,400
each organization has its own way of

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
working a set of principles that

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,879
values guide the team to a common goal

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,000
in for privacy it is not a difference a

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,959
set of

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,800
privacy principles are needed as a

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,560
foundational basis for

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,280
building products with privacy value

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
intuits

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
so with that mind we created few product

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,720
privacy principles that guide our

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,280
framework

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,239
and autos principles stood on on the

69
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,599
shoulder of giants

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
such as privacy by enzyme

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,319
data addicts such as ethics of

72
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,519
algorithms

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,640
ethics of data and ethics of practices

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,959
even qualitative experience for previous

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,480
projects we have applied all the

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,159
experience especially doing the

77
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
tests in our press projects think about

78
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,879
those preschools

79
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,640
that said you can see all those

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,920
principles here

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,480
they are not specific order or all of

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,599
their important

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,879
so they are no choice forever contacts

84
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,239
is key

85
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,360
sharing should add value plain language

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,120
powers tricks a road trust in personal

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,480
data belong to individuals

88
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,799
no choices forever we as consumers

89
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,360
change our minds every single time

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
even the same day we have different

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,519
opinions about our products

92
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,599
this principle is about it we produce

93
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,000
viewers should create mechanisms that

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,720
empower users to change their studies

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,360
in an easy way and by the way it is not

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,000
about

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,560
dumping a bunch of options in the status

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,760
with toggles

99
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,120
drop downs and using comprehensive

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
language

101
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
we should think about data controls

102
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,319
small components

103
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,920
spread the ui to allow the user to

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,959
change their mind and time

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
and as follows have said in the same

106
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
conference last year

107
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,079
and it is a sad truth no one used

108
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,720
criticize

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,120
and again based on your previous

110
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
experience you do usability tests the

111
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,639
motivation virus

112
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,720
the first one the majority of the time

113
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,840
is because the set is

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,800
chosen in the app and the instance is

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
for the user to change the intent to

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,740
zero

117
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,160
[Music]

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,560
other times the user is able to reach

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
the settings but they are afraid of

120
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
having a worse experience

121
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,800
if they change anything because the user

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,080
doesn't have a visibility

123
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
of what the settings do

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,960
and also we know that a good amount of

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
times the language in the settings is

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,240
script

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
what the heck is performance code of

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,000
fusion id hooks by the way

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,080
the user doesn't have any idea

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
as i said before the best way to give

131
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
power back to the users is allowing age

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,639
not just to check their minds anyway

133
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,720
but to see real time what's the effect

134
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,120
of their choice

135
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,639
the data control is inside the red

136
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,880
square and this is the ikea mobile app

137
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,240
it's great because it's empowered they

138
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,199
used to change their mind

139
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,680
in several place without being

140
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,360
or even chosen

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,280
so without the heck butters

142
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,240
the next one it's really interesting and

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,479
many of you may relate

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,039
contacts is key there are a bunch of

145
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,240
products out there

146
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
that are really bad about it a good

147
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,840
example is

148
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
products that use web localization

149
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,759
permission dialogue

150
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
that asks for permission when we open

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,759
that or website

152
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,680
we didn't even use them and they are

153
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,440
read asking for permission sharing

154
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,240
stored data

155
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,800
this principles about it if you need to

156
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,280
ask for

157
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,000
the consumer personal data we need to

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
care about

159
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
contacts

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
apple is clear their guideline what is

161
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,880
the best practice for this case

162
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,840
the developer must make sure permission

163
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,960
requests occur

164
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,280
only when people are using features that

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,559
clear new personal data

166
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,360
sharing should and add value i said

167
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,560
before

168
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,280
all of the principles are important and

169
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,080
all

170
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,360
all of them have the same level of

171
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
importance and i'll keep my statement

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,479
but this one is really important for

173
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,199
sure

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
uh because it has a great impact in the

175
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,880
products

176
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,680
we as consumers are using to hear if you

177
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,120
are not paying for products

178
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,599
we are the producers however we as

179
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,919
product viewers have a responsibility

180
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,000
to create experience that work well

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
whether or not the consumers share

182
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,199
personal data

183
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,960
this principle even allow us to think

184
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,280
about other privacy features for example

185
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
a privacy mode or a cognitive mode for

186
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,479
applications

187
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,840
where the user can click natal and

188
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,960
they can navigate the application

189
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,719
without their data being collected

190
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,319
uh example of the this

191
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,160
comments mode uh you can see here in the

192
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,400
ikea app they are calling

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
here private session and after you've

194
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,199
enabled server you can

195
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,360
navigate the whole app without polluting

196
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
your feeds

197
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,360
so ikea is not collecting data at all

198
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,360
plain language powers so if a company

199
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,639
has a content team

200
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,360
use them the content team will not just

201
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,479
help in the world

202
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,360
but they will improve the content the

203
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,479
content experience

204
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,440
in content organization and one of the

205
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
most important points about

206
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,919
principal is about dragons don't use

207
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,560
them

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,879
don't forget the words that diverse

209
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,919
plays

210
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,680
when writes privacy contexts in a

211
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
product we must use straightforward

212
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,039
inclusive language

213
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,360
tricks errol trusts the whole

214
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,319
relationship

215
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,520
between human data is a symmetric data

216
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,319
can see

217
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
and manipulate users without using be

218
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,039
able to see manipulate them

219
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,560
so besides being careful with

220
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
statements and back patterns we also

221
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,960
need to be mindful about the algorithms

222
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,880
we implement that may trick the user

223
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
a good example of this principle is in

224
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,159
the paper that

225
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,279
betters past present and future rv and

226
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,360
his collaborators discuss about several

227
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,159
departures

228
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
and one of them is the impact of a b

229
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
testing the consumers

230
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,720
especially try to maximize user clicking

231
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
ads

232
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,480
personal data belongs to individuals

233
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
it's important to remember

234
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,880
personal data does belong to a company

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,279
the user houses

236
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,800
and they have rights about it

237
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,720
and also all the promises all make it or

238
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,959
make it one percent clear who owns the

239
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,200
data

240
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,839
as i said before almost friends are

241
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,279
straight to the point about user rights

242
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:17,680
and

243
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
here example of california consumer

244
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,920
privacy act talking about the ratchet

245
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,080
and after this long introduction we can

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,519
talk about the journey itself

247
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,560
the main focus of the produce practice

248
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,880
journey is to prioritize privacy issues

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,360
in every phase of the book developments

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,320
we can think

251
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
about it as an audio that instead of

252
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
look just in the beginning or

253
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
in the end of the process it is embedded

254
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,800
in the whole product phase as few layers

255
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,279
with

256
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,480
a minimum of the hat

257
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,920
we did we did break down

258
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
all the phase in five layers and we made

259
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
them as simple as possible to fit any

260
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
product development methodology

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,720
if you are using a gio for his waterfall

262
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
or if you have your own stuff

263
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,120
the product person is good for you

264
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,040
so the face are inspired

265
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,079
acknowledge conceive implement

266
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,880
and validate

267
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,079
in a product not just think about

268
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,000
product privacy the consumer journey

269
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
starts with inspiration

270
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,800
how can we inspire the user consumer

271
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,920
that the product makes sense if you

272
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
think in terms of parts purpose

273
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
the previous vision is an important

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,519
asset in this phase

275
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
because the product team can transfer

276
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,320
the vision in visual work effects

277
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,600
such as illustrations data controls

278
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
or even work with other groups to

279
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,200
broadcast the vision different formats

280
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
a good example here is apple they use

281
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,360
different channels to promote their

282
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,000
vision

283
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
billboards ads and they have even a

284
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,200
section their website to talk about

285
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,640
what kind of features each

286
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,920
app has and why it is important for the

287
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,360
users to care

288
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,480
a more important a more impact privacy

289
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,279
experience

290
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
example is provided by the key app where

291
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,920
in the onboard process they expose their

292
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,800
vision using

293
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,120
image iconographies and different kinds

294
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,839
of contents

295
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,079
one important step of the product parts

296
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,480
journey is about technology

297
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,040
what are the customer expectations about

298
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,399
the products

299
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,360
or even the organization we know that

300
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,959
consumers are more sensible about few

301
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,079
kinds of products

302
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,720
so social network apps and things attack

303
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,600
related

304
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
so the way we conceptualize or even

305
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
better builds the products may be

306
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,519
affected by this perception

307
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,360
other point we need to keep in mind is

308
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
that

309
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,200
company or products they hold this

310
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,240
perception

311
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
we need to understand what are the comp

312
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
expectations about privacy

313
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,160
in their products the vision and price

314
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,720
value help a lot here

315
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,920
in the final point about this phase

316
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,880
it is that privacy requirements must be

317
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
well understood and mapped

318
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,399
in product requirements and impacts to

319
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,440
the usability and

320
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,160
experience must be understood as well so

321
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,440
we should avoid

322
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,839
trade-offs we should practice and

323
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,360
usability everything matters

324
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,399
so summarizing

325
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,600
this phase it is all about

326
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,279
pay attention to consumer products

327
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,639
perspective

328
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
uh understand the premise the

329
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
organizational expectations

330
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,839
and also take a look in the privacy law

331
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,440
requirements

332
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,839
in the end we would expect to have

333
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,079
privacy requirements method productive

334
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,800
products product features and also

335
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
privacy materials

336
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
with previous requirements method in

337
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,720
product tasks we can start to think

338
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,760
about how

339
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,399
we can conceive the products but avoid

340
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:10,959
the

341
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,440
private stack patterns understand the

342
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
risks of handling data later

343
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
so this whole phase about the design

344
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,399
phase of

345
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,750
the product or premise feature

346
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,800
[Music]

347
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
in this phase we should pay attention to

348
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,240
back pairs to avoid them

349
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,839
and use the principles to guide the team

350
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,920
to create a great experience

351
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,040
in the end we are going to have visual

352
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,719
components and data controls

353
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
in the implementation phase the team

354
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,279
should not just

355
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,560
focus in following the

356
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,959
standards but they also need to be

357
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
attention how they can build privacy

358
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,720
infrastructure that reduce

359
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,760
friction to implement those standards uh

360
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
always pay attention to the security

361
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
best practice implements algorithms that

362
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
are fair

363
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,399
in the ends about using our edit limited

364
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,760
price infrastructure

365
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,040
pay attention to infosec guidelines

366
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,600
to the privacy principles and make sure

367
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,120
if your company has privacy

368
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,240
considerations

369
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,920
use them in the end we should always aim

370
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
to improve the privacy infrastructure

371
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
and also of course build components that

372
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,360
need

373
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,399
needed by the products

374
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,240
and the last one is the validation

375
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
phase where the team checks if the

376
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,279
privacy

377
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
requirements are fulfilled and also do

378
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
usability tests to make sure

379
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
the experience is good

380
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,000
again summarizing the team should pay

381
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,880
attention

382
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,560
and should do uh using the test to check

383
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,040
the clients of privacy controls

384
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
check if private secured measures meet

385
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
previous law requirements and look

386
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,920
the metrics to make sure they fulfill

387
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,839
the kpis

388
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
for sake of simplicity we also can

389
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,440
represent the product price running in a

390
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
timeline where you can see the

391
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,639
journaling phase

392
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,760
here you can see all the phase uh the

393
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,000
first

394
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
one again we have the phase where you

395
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
inspire the user so we have

396
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,360
to pay attention for the premise vision

397
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
we have the acknowledge phase where you

398
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,959
pay attention for

399
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,279
private consumer privacy perspective

400
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,959
organization for expectations they are

401
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,800
also the personal importance

402
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,600
uh in the considerable phase we should

403
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,120
avoid experience

404
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,240
and look in the product practice journey

405
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,440
principles

406
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
in the implementation phase we should

407
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,480
use

408
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
enhance the privacy infrastructure

409
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
looking infosec guidelines

410
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,600
and use the privacy the product practice

411
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,120
journey principles

412
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,600
in the event phase uh again it's about

413
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,480
doing usability tests to make sure all

414
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
you did make sense

415
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,959
and verify if all the

416
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,240
secret measures in privacy meet

417
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,839
the law requirements

418
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,639
you may be asking and you may be asked

419
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,800
what's the responsibility of each group

420
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,839
we also fought a lot about it a lot of

421
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,600
the responsibilities are shared across

422
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,880
teams

423
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,199
few of them are specific for each group

424
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,720
and they can be represented

425
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
in the squares using the beginning of

426
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,759
the presentation

427
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
so for example avoid experience

428
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,120
is responsibility of the design team

429
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
and the book management team enzyme team

430
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,680
should

431
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,720
look into private this ux

432
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,560
should work on privacy because of these

433
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,720
tasks uh

434
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
the the tech team should

435
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
work on the privacy infrastructure and

436
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,480
also take a look at the infosec

437
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,519
guidelines and we have like a

438
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,639
some of the some of them

439
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,120
shared across the whole team like the

440
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,039
division practical requirements for the

441
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,559
professional principles

442
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,160
that practice considerations and

443
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,400
consumer perspective

444
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,599
all the interesting thing about

445
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
frameworks because even

446
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,199
if even if here we're just thinking

447
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,240
about pm's

448
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,199
design and technology we can add even

449
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,799
more dimensions if needed but

450
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
basically organization for example a new

451
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,799
square would be

452
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,360
a different c will be a new square in

453
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,480
this

454
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,760
representation here so if i have a

455
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
compliance team a complexity would be

456
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,960
a new square so it's all formal is able

457
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,799
to scale

458
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,840
and that's it thank you very much
