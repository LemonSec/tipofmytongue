1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,960
thank you very much for the opportunity

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,160
to talk at this conference

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,960
there's a gap between the personal focus

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,440
of

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,160
data protection legislation and practice

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,720
and the

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,560
communal implications of internet

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,960
connected technology

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,000
this talk summarizes some of our recent

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
and ongoing efforts to address this gap

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
i will introduce the problem space

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,280
before illustrating a promising research

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,480
approach

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,879
by discussing two case studies and i

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,920
will conclude

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
with offering some implications for

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,200
research design

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,320
and practice

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,160
the use of internet connected technology

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,879
is often

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,920
accompanied by concerns of privacy and

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,199
data protection

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,800
and here i briefly highlight communal

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,880
aspects of privacy as they are reflected

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,840
in legislation and in the academic

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,720
literature

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,439
legislation is traditionally concerned

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,000
with

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,439
an individual right to privacy

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
for example the general data protection

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,280
regulation

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,479
explicitly excludes households

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,000
from its consideration the california

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
consumer privacy act

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,960
includes households as a label and

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
defines them as deserving of data

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
protection rights

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,880
but does so without a clear definition

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,520
of what personal information constitutes

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,079
or means

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,159
in relation to the concept of a

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,720
household

43
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,439
in the academic literature privacy

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,799
beyond the individual

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
has of course been approached in various

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
different technological contexts

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,960
and providing different interpretations

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
um to name one group privacy

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,878
is often referred to in terms of

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,399
differential privacy research

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,160
to name another one network privacy has

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,599
been

53
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,840
researched in context of online social

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
networks

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,959
but overall there's a lack of

56
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
understanding of privacy

57
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,640
in communal spaces so what are communal

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,760
spaces and

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,280
why are they interesting communal spaces

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,360
are shared spaces such as

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
homes or cafes or airports and we find

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
that these spaces are increasingly

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
equipped with ambient and pervasive

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,599
internet connected technology

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,800
it is in these spaces that heterogeneous

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,160
groupings of individuals come together

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
these could be families these could be

68
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,400
groups of friends this could be

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
individual travelers and so

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,319
we see different dynamic social

71
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,959
structures we can imagine that there are

72
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:05,680
sometimes

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
attributed responsibilities and

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,720
sometimes unattributed responsibilities

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,879
and we can definitely expect to see

76
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,840
varying

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,720
levels of skill when it comes to the use

78
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,159
and administration

79
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,720
of technology um and we have already

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,360
seen that privacy is in itself is

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,560
context dependent

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,799
and highly situational and that there is

83
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,000
a lack of

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,440
understanding of what privacy might mean

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,360
within these contexts so we ask

86
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,799
how can research explore and facilitate

87
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,040
design for privacy in communal spaces

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,080
one way to approach this question is

89
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
through co-design workshops and

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,360
we inspired our research approach

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
by the future workshop format which has

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,200
been

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,400
used successfully by others before us

94
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
to investigate issues where no clear

95
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,920
understanding no

96
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,280
clear definition of any theory was at

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,000
hand

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
the format includes three stages two of

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
which we adopted

100
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,279
we adopted critiquing the present

101
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,759
and envisioning the future we did not

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
adopt the implementation change

103
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,400
stage the method has

104
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,479
inherently a focus on social and

105
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,000
communal factors

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
which benefits our desire to understand

107
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,639
privacy

108
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,880
in communal spaces we also decided

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,320
to facilitate these workshops by using

110
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,960
design techniques and artifacts simply

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,919
to see

112
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,240
if they could be useful but also to

113
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,040
bring in

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,320
more diversity in terms of contextual

115
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,120
information

116
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,240
background information i will briefly

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,960
introduce the two parts as we

118
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,639
conceptualize them for our workshops

119
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
in part a critiquing the present we have

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
three stages

121
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,199
so first we want to explore the social

122
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,560
and physical aspects

123
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
of shared spaces because we know that

124
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,000
they are

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,360
relevant to understandings of privacy

126
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,680
we do this through affinity diagramming

127
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,600
and sketching

128
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,720
in some sense similar

129
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,440
to the kind of techniques and methods

130
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,479
used for

131
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,479
context scenarios as contexts to explore

132
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,520
we choose

133
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,599
the home and the cafe

134
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,680
in the second step we want to attune to

135
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,160
popular data protection issues to bring

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,520
the

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,080
the ideas of privacy and security in the

138
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
methods of data protection

139
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,280
at the forefront we use

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,400
two different examples to do this we

141
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,199
have

142
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,280
browser bar ad locks the green padlocks

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,639
to discuss one example of a security

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,000
aspect

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,720
and we use the mobile application

146
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
permissions

147
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,960
to discuss some of the more privacy

148
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
related aspects

149
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
people are largely familiar with they

150
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,720
have encountered with in their own

151
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,759
lived experiences this phase

152
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,800
is researcher land and then we have a

153
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
third phase

154
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,199
where we hope participants take

155
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
more delete and they do so in reflecting

156
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,160
on further issues of data protection

157
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
to facilitate this phase we

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,000
also provide a list of guiding questions

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,600
just in case

160
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
the participants would still struggle to

161
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,039
relate

162
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,080
to the issue the second

163
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,360
phase rb

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
um it's all about envisioning the future

165
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
and actually doing some design work

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,840
so as a first step we ask

167
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,440
to our groups to design for

168
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
any one of the shared spaces they

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,880
explored in part a

170
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
and for this part we assist when

171
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
prompted when asked

172
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,479
and optionally provide them a set of

173
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,120
personas just to allow them to be more

174
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,319
creative and filling up filling the

175
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,520
social and physical

176
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,319
space they had been thinking about in

177
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,000
part a

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,759
as a second step we asked them to

179
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,199
consider a different

180
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,599
social and physical space a different

181
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,360
kind of shared space

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,639
than the one they had considered for the

183
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,080
for the first design exercise here

184
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,319
either we asked them to use one of their

185
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
own which they also sketched in part a

186
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
or we asked them to use in the sketch of

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,240
a

188
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,599
of a different group and finally we ask

189
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,160
them

190
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,680
to reflect on the overall design process

191
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,039
and their experience and of course to

192
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,599
present their design solutions to the

193
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,840
group

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
we piloted the approach with four groups

195
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,360
of students

196
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,400
and experts researchers

197
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,080
at our department their task was to

198
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
co-design a good internet connection

199
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,840
experience

200
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,360
considering usable security and privacy

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,559
and we asked them to do so for homes

202
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,360
and cafes so naturally according to our

203
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,159
approach

204
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,360
the first step was to explore the

205
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,200
cafe and the home as communal spaces

206
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,000
considering

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,279
social and physical aspects

208
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,480
and they were then asked to create

209
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,760
design solutions for a good internet

210
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,120
connection experience

211
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
simply the process of connecting

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,000
or logging into a wi-fi network

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,519
in either space

214
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,399
i will now present two case studies from

215
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,440
these workshops

216
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,640
um the first case study describes a

217
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
concept

218
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,120
called the data flush and the second

219
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
case study

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
talks about putting a password in the

221
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,320
kitchen cupboard

222
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,279
the data flush was a concept

223
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,080
by group number two and group number two

224
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,560
was

225
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
asked to design their good internet

226
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
connection experience

227
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,120
based on a sketch of a cafe that was

228
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,839
actually

229
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,360
created by group number one

230
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,000
one of the goals of group number two was

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,279
to focus on

232
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,120
achieving anonymity on the wi-fi network

233
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
during and after using the network

234
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,000
they wanted devices to be remembered for

235
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,040
24 hours though simply for

236
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,040
better usability and i considered that

237
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,240
if they came back and they were prompted

238
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,440
to log in again so showing that the

239
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,519
network did not remember them

240
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,480
was a proof of erasure of their data

241
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
they um further discussed the issue and

242
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
they realized that a more sort of

243
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,920
tactile solution actually would also

244
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,600
have benefits and so they came up with

245
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,079
this

246
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,399
idea of the data flush so the data flush

247
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,959
simply provides this reassurance

248
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,000
of um data actually being deleted

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
by tapping out and

250
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,279
they discussed where this flush could be

251
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
located so initially they had considered

252
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,480
a group of friends

253
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,600
entering the cafe and buying some drinks

254
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
getting access to the network at the

255
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
till and then sitting down at a table

256
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,360
and sharing the table and so

257
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,959
once they would be done drinking their

258
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,519
drinks or simply wanted to move on

259
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,839
they would tap out and that tapping out

260
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,160
would flush all of the data and

261
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,440
anonymity was restored the first thing

262
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,560
they realized

263
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,320
was that you know one of the friends

264
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,360
might leave earlier than others and so

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
they simply said well

266
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,279
the last person to leave the table could

267
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,320
just flush all of the data

268
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,440
when they took a second look at

269
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,959
the context sketch they also saw that

270
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,760
of course people who are not friends may

271
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
not arrive at the same time

272
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
may not want to interact with each other

273
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,360
could also

274
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,880
share the same table in the picture that

275
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,160
is shown as two people

276
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,279
working on their laptops

277
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,959
so they had a need to revise their

278
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,519
design

279
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,240
and the way they solved the situation

280
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,160
was by moving the button

281
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,920
from the table to the door so that

282
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,800
people would get their access to the

283
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,000
network individually

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,720
when buying a drink at the till or by

285
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,839
other means

286
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,720
but could also step out of the network

287
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,680
individually

288
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,680
when leaving the cafe

289
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,519
group number four designed a solution

290
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,000
and network connection solution for the

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,760
home

292
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,680
and they were asked to consider

293
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,480
different personas in in doing so so we

294
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,040
can see

295
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,560
a david messi and sarah in the solution

296
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,440
sketch on the

297
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,200
right hand side solution

298
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,680
considered um how to make the the

299
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,240
network

300
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,959
secure but also accessible for people

301
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,519
with

302
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,639
different skills and they came up with

303
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,079
a sort of connect button very similar

304
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,000
to what is available already

305
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
they then also came up with a connect

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,399
app so that the more technological able

307
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,680
person in this case

308
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,760
sarah could enable others to connect to

309
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,959
the network

310
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,880
even though she might not be at home

311
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,160
um they further considered that having

312
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,760
the bottom at the router was not

313
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680
particularly secure given that

314
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,920
guests could make use of it unsupervised

315
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,200
and that the app with sarah was

316
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,880
probably not particularly useful if

317
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,839
sarah didn't have

318
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,880
any reception or simply could not attend

319
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,639
to the issue

320
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,360
so they also wanted david and matthew to

321
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,760
be

322
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,279
more independent they considered various

323
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,160
different solutions for this

324
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,839
ultimately they realized that by

325
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,320
putting a password for the wifi network

326
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,680
into the kitchen cupboard

327
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,920
they could make use of a kind of

328
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,519
semi-public space as they described it

329
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,920
the kitchen cupboard being a space

330
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
people who would

331
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,279
live in the home could access

332
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,399
and would also know about

333
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,199
but not being a space people who would

334
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,519
not

335
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,600
live in the home or not be frequent

336
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,160
visitors and trusted friends and the

337
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,000
kitchen cupboard not being a space those

338
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
people

339
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,000
would access now i would like to offer

340
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,360
some reflections on our methodology

341
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,839
and on the findings from our pilot study

342
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,120
first of all there are some obvious

343
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
limitations here

344
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,839
the pilot study made use of students as

345
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,279
participants only

346
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,440
and of course you can say that students

347
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,480
are somewhat

348
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,199
limited in their lived experiences

349
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,160
particularly

350
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,360
particularly pertaining to the home as a

351
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,839
context

352
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,399
and of course we made a deliberate

353
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,399
choice when we choose the home

354
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,720
and the cafe as to very different

355
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,360
physical and social contexts the cafe is

356
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,639
being more public and

357
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,880
at the home as being a more private

358
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,199
space

359
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,360
insights from the design artifacts

360
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,480
though allowed participants to readjust

361
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,920
the appropriateness

362
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
of their proposed design solutions for

363
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
example

364
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,360
personal characteristics from personas

365
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
allowed them to reconsider

366
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,240
whether every

367
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,360
individual could use a particular

368
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,320
solution

369
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
and how they could accommodate for the

370
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,480
needs of individuals

371
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,880
and rules and relationships as they

372
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,639
found their way into the context

373
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,279
sketches of our groups but also as they

374
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,399
were taken by

375
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,560
our participants from the context

376
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,759
sketches for their design solutions

377
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,199
were quite relatable to them and on one

378
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,399
instance

379
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,160
a group discussed how rules and

380
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,440
relationships were

381
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,279
much more relatable than social norms

382
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,639
or social obligations so they found this

383
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,600
easier to deal with

384
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,279
we also can say then that artifacts such

385
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,040
artifacts can help surface

386
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
some of these sort of tested contextual

387
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,560
variations

388
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,480
that otherwise are known to influence

389
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,399
co-design particularly

390
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,839
for privacy so it seems

391
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,360
these artifacts can be quite useful

392
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,639
some reflections on our findings

393
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,519
the friends who shared the coffee table

394
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,480
sort of had a

395
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
common goal and maybe

396
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,440
because of that common goal they were

397
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,519
able to share data protection

398
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,040
responsibilities

399
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,079
so then there might be a potential role

400
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,040
for the use of social groupings and in

401
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,720
framing discussions around

402
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,120
design

403
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,800
and these social groupings can be

404
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
friends with common goals

405
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,000
could be families with small children

406
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,199
or any other

407
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,640
characteristics of groups

408
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,559
and then the need for individuals to

409
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
consider the abilities and

410
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,160
needs of others or draws particularly

411
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,959
attention to the kind of relationships

412
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,000
people have

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,960
in these shared spaces and of course

414
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,360
they

415
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,160
can be really complicated but also in

416
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,360
recognizing these

417
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
relationships which are maybe sometimes

418
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
dependent relationships

419
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
such as parents and their children or

420
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,559
sometimes more equal relationships

421
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,679
such as between spouses or between

422
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,960
people who share a flat there can be

423
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,679
benefit

424
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,520
in well further exploring and

425
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,559
considering these relationships

426
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,360
and something like storing a password in

427
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,600
the kitchen cupboard because it is a

428
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,200
samey private space also illustrates

429
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
the actual resourcefulness of

430
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,120
participants

431
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,760
um and and how creative they can be in

432
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,640
enabling

433
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
data protection in communal spaces so

434
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,559
this gives

435
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,520
yeah gives provides an insight as to

436
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,120
like

437
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,039
how valuable the method can be

438
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,919
um so i will conclude with a few

439
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,000
implications here um

440
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,080
it seems that communal spaces and

441
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
concomitant relationships are

442
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,160
important considerations for design of

443
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,960
internet connected technologies

444
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,280
and it seems that structured contextual

445
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,080
artifacts such as those that capture

446
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,960
social and physical aspects of these

447
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,559
communal spaces

448
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,600
can help to inform data protection can

449
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,120
help to inform design for data

450
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,160
protection

451
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,280
but it also seems that our approach

452
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
communal participatory design

453
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,799
might be useful to innovate

454
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,240
for privacy beyond the individual

455
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,559
with that i would like to conclude my

456
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,840
presentation and i'm happy to take any

457
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
questions
