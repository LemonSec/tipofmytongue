00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,840
hi folks

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,280
today we're going to be assessing

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,400
privacy risk with the ipa triad

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,800
before we begin my name's mark i could

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
describe myself as a few different

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,480
things but largely i've just worked on a

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,800
huge variety of projects

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,240
coming from a decade of software

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,640
engineering before my shift in focus to

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,720
security and privacy

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,640
today i run a small consultancy called

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,840
obscure group

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,920
and before that i was a privacy engineer

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,960
at google

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,640
providing consulting to their hardware

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,719
product teams and marketing groups

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,280
and before then i was a doing product

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,719
security at square

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,200
working with all their products before

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,039
that i was working on squares blue team

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,120
building detection tools and incident

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,640
response pipelines

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
and before then i was a founding member

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,680
of the square capital product team

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,920
now before all of that i was working at

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
a variety of small to medium-sized tech

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,480
companies building products and services

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,799
in advertising social networking

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,680
e-commerce

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
collaboration tools etc overall i built

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
up a skill set that's been really

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,479
helpful for jumping into complex new

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,439
spaces

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,360
assessing what needs to be done and

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,200
moving on to the next problem

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,040
so today i wanted to share a few tools

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,560
that will hopefully help you

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,640
when you're jumping into complex privacy

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
problems so that you can address them

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
and similarly move on

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,520
so we have a few different sections

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,840
today i'm just going to dive right into

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,320
the introduction

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
and i want to give you a different

45
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,680
perspective on privacy

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,040
but first let's learn from our

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,360
colleagues in security

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,280
what does it mean to be secure or not

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
secure well there's a concept known as

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,079
the cia triad which is considered one of

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,520
the key concepts

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,920
used to describe what qualities must be

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,600
protected in order to consider the

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,560
information

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,719
wholly secure in principle in summary

56
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,399
confidentiality is about exposure risk

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,560
integrity is about tamper risk

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,880
availability is about resource denial

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,680
risk

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
and having these different properties

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,720
has been really helpful

62
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,959
in having more nuanced risk discussions

63
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,080
and analysis

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,000
rather than just saying something is

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,239
secure or not secure

66
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,319
so great but what does it mean to be

67
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,520
private or

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,000
not private well there's a bunch of

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
different approaches to this depending

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
on where you're coming from

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,360
um you can jump into data protection

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,879
concepts like collection

73
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,599
processing transparency consent and

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,400
control

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,160
but sometimes it feels like rushing to

76
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
standard solutions when you don't really

77
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,200
have a bigger picture of what you're

78
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
trying to protect

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
you can talk about what users care about

80
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
and what they personally find

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
creepy or clearly compromising their own

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,720
privacy but these assumptions really

83
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,280
vary

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
a lot between individuals and

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
communities and user expectations are

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,200
also highly subject to their lived

87
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
experiences

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
technical literacy and access to

89
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,840
meaningful data about how their

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
information is used

91
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
we can consider the motives and means

92
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,080
various attackers would seek to

93
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
compromise others privacy

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but attack surfaces and techniques are

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,519
constantly changing

96
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,200
and that can make it really difficult to

97
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,040
maintain a collective understanding and

98
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,400
language to describe privacy this way

99
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,120
so coming from security i wanted a way

100
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,920
to describe

101
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,239
properties of privacy and what i ended

102
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,080
up with was

103
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
identity presence

104
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,200
and activity let's just dive right into

105
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,360
these

106
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,319
identity is about data that reveals who

107
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,280
it's about

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
um so things like a full name a date of

109
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
birth social security number

110
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,040
can be attributed to an individual or

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,879
when you're talking about a group

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,720
it could be a member of a household

113
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
employee of a company

114
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,040
being part of a social circle of some

115
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,239
sort

116
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,920
or whether you're talking about some

117
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,400
larger population like a nationality

118
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,000
gender age group religion

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
now for presence this is really about

120
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
data that reveals

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
um where someone has been not

122
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
necessarily who they are but just that a

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
human was there at some point

124
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
and here's an example of some things

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,120
that can return data

126
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,759
that indicate human presence at a given

127
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,160
point in time

128
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,120
now activity is about data that reveals

129
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,520
what

130
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
happened at a given point in time and so

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,479
here are some examples below

132
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,919
that show um you know data

133
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,560
about you know what somebody was doing

134
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,440
while they wore

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
an activity monitor or maybe as they

136
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,919
used an app or made a purchase what

137
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,000
behavioral data they generated

138
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,320
or what hardware can sense the

139
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,840
environment around them

140
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,240
to detect activities in some unique

141
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
interesting way

142
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,520
hmm you may have spotted something now

143
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,000
from the previous examples it's actually

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
rare to find data that doesn't involve

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
multiple properties or expose another

146
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,120
property via inferences

147
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
and that's pretty similar to how the cia

148
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,280
triad works in practice too

149
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,600
for example if an attacker subverts the

150
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,199
confidentiality of a credential

151
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,440
they could use it to log into a system

152
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
and modify and delete data

153
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,840
which could affect integrity and

154
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
availability

155
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
here's a venn diagram of various subsets

156
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,759
of how

157
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
data can be of multiple properties um

158
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,240
when you're smack dab in the middle

159
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
it kind of means that you're seen from

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,280
all sides

161
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
it's about who you are what you're doing

162
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
and where you are

163
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,360
a good example of this is a video camera

164
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,880
they're all around us these days

165
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,840
um and they're pretty high sensitivity

166
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,479
on all

167
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,560
three um scales so um

168
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,479
yeah you see them in doorbells security

169
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
cameras in your phone

170
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,000
uh all over the place authenticated

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,199
interactions

172
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,960
now before when i talked about

173
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,319
behavioral data

174
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,840
um describing um various activities you

175
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,800
might do

176
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
a lot of time they're tied to your

177
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
identity explicitly

178
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,759
via some user identifier or some session

179
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,639
that you have

180
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
in that context and in this case

181
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,639
somebody is making a payment

182
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,120
which is linked to your identity and

183
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,840
often

184
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,880
a place in the real world so this is

185
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,280
also

186
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,039
all three um at least in theory

187
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,520
badge entry systems are also an

188
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,280
authenticated interaction

189
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,639
which encompass a couple different

190
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,120
properties

191
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,800
let's dive into how we perform

192
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
risk assessments using a qualitative

193
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,080
approach

194
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,759
there's a general methodology i'm just

195
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,440
going to introduce here

196
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,400
it's about averaging three things

197
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
severity scope and likelihood

198
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,639
and the impact becomes the shorthand for

199
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,800
the overall negative privacy effect to

200
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,280
be avoided

201
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,080
severity it's informed by sensitivity or

202
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,840
the damage potential

203
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,800
i.e what is the harm experienced in this

204
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
picture a squirt gun is shown

205
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,319
and this might be considered a mild

206
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,400
annoyance to most people

207
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
maybe less so if you're replacing a

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,919
circuit breaker or operating heavy

209
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,880
machinery

210
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,080
but that's out of scope in more extreme

211
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,280
cases of severity

212
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,199
the outcome might be injury or death

213
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,360
now scope is about a pool of a

214
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
population or users or systems

215
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,520
or whatever you're trying to protect

216
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,599
and here i'm showing a drop of water but

217
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,360
to you this might mean a handful of

218
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,240
users

219
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,280
using a subset of your application

220
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,199
in more extreme examples the scope could

221
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,639
be every single user

222
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,639
past and present moving on to likelihood

223
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,720
it's informed by the number of steps or

224
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,319
the complexity for the risk to be

225
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,840
realized

226
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
the practice of threat modeling is

227
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,360
extremely useful for determining

228
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
likelihood

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
since it involves deeper knowledge of

230
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
the design the implementation or the

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
operation details

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,479
now in this example you can interpret

233
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,000
the baby puzzle metaphor

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
either way if this if solving it means

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the risk is realized then you could

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,879
consider the likelihood pretty high

237
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,479
now if you interpret the design more

238
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,639
literally and that a baby puzzle is

239
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,160
harder to lose pieces

240
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,720
break during use or accidentally swallow

241
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,440
a piece

242
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,639
then you might consider the risk

243
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,599
likelihood being low

244
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,919
in a complex system the metaphor can

245
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,479
also be taken in a couple directions

246
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,799
for example if realizing the risk

247
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,200
requires highly specialized knowledge

248
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,159
tools preconditions then the likelihood

249
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,839
might be considered low

250
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,800
alternatively if you consider to be to

251
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
have the overall system be complex

252
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,519
various prone to various types of

253
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,320
failures

254
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,720
and have a larger attack surface then

255
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
you might actually consider the

256
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,640
likelihood high

257
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,839
so what does using this methodology look

258
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,240
like

259
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,279
as a bunch of potential outcomes well

260
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,600
for those who are more visual learners

261
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,519
here is basically a table of all the

262
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,600
potential outputs

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
and if you find the intersect here with

264
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,040
low severity

265
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,760
medium scope and high likelihood we find

266
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
that we have a medium impact

267
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,120
with a little bit of practice you can

268
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
pretty much do this in your head

269
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,600
and if the impact ever feels overstated

270
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
or understated

271
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,399
it's a good indicator that one of your

272
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,200
inputs was improperly assessed

273
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,680
but sometimes risks are more complicated

274
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,360
and in those cases it's important to

275
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
contextualize your risk impact

276
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,160
and state the assumptions you've made as

277
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
a side note

278
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
if your severity scope or likelihood is

279
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,399
none

280
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,600
your impact is always none

281
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
so here's how i suggest you use the ipa

282
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,519
triad properties

283
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,160
um i suggest you use them to inform risk

284
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,120
severity

285
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,399
via the infrared data sensitivity

286
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,560
um this should be somewhat intuitive

287
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,720
here but an example of something i would

288
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
consider to be a

289
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
high identity sensitivity could be like

290
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
biometrics

291
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,959
uh video footage that sort of thing um

292
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,839
i'll move on for time's sake though

293
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,560
let's go into some exact use cases

294
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
where i found the ipa triad to be

295
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
helpful

296
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,160
developer apis so

297
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
there is a lot of different ways to

298
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
authorize users

299
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,519
i'm going to loosely describe what it

300
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,440
means to be an oauth provider

301
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,200
but i'll let you know the same

302
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,320
principles can be applied elsewhere

303
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,000
now developer apis basically provide

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,279
third-party access to user data and

305
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,839
typically through resources that allow

306
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,440
you to either create

307
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
read update or delete records

308
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,959
and historically at least from what i've

309
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,200
seen most companies usually consider

310
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
read to be the least sensitive

311
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,800
permission since create

312
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
update and delete are really the primary

313
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
targets for attackers to cause

314
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
operational disruption to you for your

315
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,079
users

316
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,760
um these would be like integrity or

317
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,680
availability attacks

318
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,640
um but this laid-back approach is how

319
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
you get yourself into a cambridge

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
analytica situation where attackers are

321
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
actually using your

322
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,680
read apis to silently slurp up user data

323
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,920
for their own malicious uses and when

324
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
you're not careful in this regard

325
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
it's really hard to walk back from

326
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,959
without thoughtful assessments and

327
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,920
long-term api deprecation roadmaps

328
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,160
where users end up at risk until the

329
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,839
apis change

330
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,079
which can take a while so it's better to

331
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,000
design it right up front

332
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,839
this is what the typical authorization

333
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,120
process looks like

334
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,880
but the important thing to note is that

335
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,440
a user can grant multiple permissions

336
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,480
in addition each permission can grant

337
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,880
access to numerous developer api

338
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,079
resources

339
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,839
each with varying sensitivity

340
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
so what i recommend you do if you're

341
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,399
building out your own developer apis

342
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,320
is that you really assess the resources

343
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,920
that you're providing

344
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
using the risk assessment methodology i

345
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,760
described to better understand the

346
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,600
privacy risk to your users

347
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
and this is a great opportunity to

348
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
review other risks as well like

349
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
financial or operational

350
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,959
or abuse and once you've done that

351
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,800
you can pretty much just generate a

352
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,959
spreadsheet formula to

353
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,279
calculate your aggregate risk

354
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,480
sensitivity

355
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,760
across resources to really tell you what

356
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,079
a permission scope's risk is

357
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,920
but i do stress that it's important to

358
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,120
take a step back

359
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
and look at the bigger picture revealed

360
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,160
by all the data

361
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,800
does one resource have a low identity

362
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,839
sensitivity

363
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,920
but another one have a high identity

364
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,040
sensitivity

365
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,200
and together do they allow really strong

366
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,399
correlations

367
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,279
that now expose a strongly identified

368
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,000
individual's presence or activities

369
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,920
these can be really useful insights as

370
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,160
well

371
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,360
then i recommend you de-risk your

372
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,519
platform by applying the principle of

373
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,760
least privilege to your users data

374
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,720
um you can take a permission scope that

375
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,399
gives you access to way too many

376
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,079
sensitive resources

377
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,480
and break it into useful sub permissions

378
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,320
and what's really important is even if

379
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
you can't meaningfully change your

380
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,959
permission structure what you should

381
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,519
really stress

382
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
to do is to make sure that you're

383
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
communicating the sensitivity of

384
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,560
permissions

385
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,360
to your users when they are granting

386
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
other parties access to them

387
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,760
because a lot of times um users just

388
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,839
click yeah sure i'll allow it i want the

389
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,040
thing to happen

390
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,000
and they don't really understand what

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,040
what data access they're providing

392
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,279
let's talk about device sensors another

393
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,480
use case

394
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,160
but before we do that let's borrow

395
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,079
another security concept

396
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,399
side channel attacks and this is where

397
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,440
you can use

398
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,680
information to make inferences about

399
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,279
sensitive data based on

400
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,480
how you understand the device to work

401
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
so let's take a look at a few examples

402
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,240
to see what kinds of information we can

403
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,680
glean from raw

404
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,959
high fidelity sensor data well

405
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,040
smart watch style heart rate monitors

406
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,120
from an identity perspective

407
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,079
they don't really return a lot of unique

408
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,399
interesting information

409
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,480
like something that would directly

410
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,440
measure the heart

411
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,279
so that you can't really tell if anybody

412
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,040
has like a heart abnormality like a

413
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
murmur etc

414
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,360
but from a presence perspective the fact

415
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
that you have a pulse is a pretty high

416
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,880
sign that there is uh

417
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,240
somebody on the other end of that device

418
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,199
and also during physical exertion heart

419
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,240
rate is known to go

420
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
up so a lot of these things are

421
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,959
advertised as activity monitors and so

422
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,680
yes you you can get the activity

423
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,839
information from these readings

424
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,279
gps um if these are on all the time

425
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,279
chances are the owner is going to return

426
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,399
to their home

427
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,720
so that's a pretty identifiable piece of

428
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,680
information

429
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,320
sometimes addresses are listed in public

430
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,680
records

431
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,079
um if the device hasn't moved in a while

432
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,519
it may not actually be

433
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,639
a good signal of whether or not there's

434
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,320
a human present

435
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,199
but if it's moving chances are there's a

436
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,079
human attached to it

437
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,959
now if the device is known to be

438
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,079
somewhere

439
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,440
like a restaurant a gym a shopping mall

440
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,920
a place of worship maybe an adult

441
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,720
bookstore

442
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
or a healthcare clinic you might be able

443
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,880
to infer some kind of activities of that

444
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,680
person

445
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
so from an activity perspective this

446
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,199
data is interesting as well

447
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,079
air quality sensors well these ones are

448
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,680
interesting because they don't tell you

449
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,160
a whole lot about someone's identity

450
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,240
maybe a stretch but maybe someone with a

451
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,519
lot of perfume

452
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,759
might trip the volatile organic compound

453
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,720
sensors

454
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,680
but i think that's you know who can say

455
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,519
without actual testing

456
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,000
um depending on placement they can

457
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,839
actually pick up human movements pretty

458
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:12,399
well

459
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
based on like an unusual disturbance of

460
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,519
patterns

461
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,320
um in what you're seeing in the ambient

462
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
environment

463
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,600
otherwise you might have to infer

464
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
presence via other activity

465
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,959
now air quality sensors are interesting

466
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,120
in that they can react significantly to

467
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
activities like

468
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,759
opening a door or window or cooking a

469
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,880
meal on the stove

470
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,959
or taking a shower or lighting a

471
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,240
cigarette so

472
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,560
they do expose some information that i

473
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
think most people wouldn't guess

474
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,079
so what do we do to protect sensor data

475
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,480
well

476
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,199
you get creative and you you think about

477
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,199
what you could possibly do with the raw

478
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,639
information

479
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,160
there's a lot of research out there

480
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,000
about how you can use

481
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,040
hardware sensors for various purposes

482
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,800
check it out even if the implications

483
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,319
haven't reached your product domain yet

484
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,359
so the most important thing i think you

485
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,839
can do

486
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,000
is to isolate processing so the data

487
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
never leaves the device

488
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
that way you fully minimize your data

489
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,160
exposure risk

490
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,720
but what's also important too is that

491
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,319
the user knows

492
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,640
under what circumstances data does leave

493
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,520
their device

494
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,839
and give them control over it i think

495
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,280
there's a lot of people who don't trust

496
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,240
microphone

497
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,720
embedded devices and perceive them to be

498
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,080
always recording

499
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,240
even if they're just keeping a local

500
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,440
stored buffer

501
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,520
and occasionally sending relevant pieces

502
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,200
to the cloud

503
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,480
i think that there's a lot of

504
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,720
expectations users have about

505
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
stuff that stays on devices that just

506
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
isn't fully there yet

507
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,280
um if you can't do everything on device

508
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,840
the

509
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,280
the next best thing you can do is

510
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,360
degrade the signals much as

511
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
usably possible to minimize inferences

512
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,799
of other activities or important

513
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,840
information

514
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
so going back to something like a radar

515
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,120
sensor like

516
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,679
wi-fi that's really interesting because

517
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,440
you can basically get a good

518
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,080
3d picture of the world around you and

519
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
so something you can do that's helpful

520
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
is you can instead of returning

521
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,600
continuous data

522
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
maybe you return information at more

523
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,880
discrete intervals

524
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,799
that make it harder to tell exact

525
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,240
movements

526
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,799
and so that can decrease your activity

527
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,799
sensitivity from that data

528
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,520
um other things you can do is you can

529
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,080
let's say

530
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,919
return less precise data so can

531
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,400
something like um a radar sensor um

532
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,320
be sent at like a lower resolution

533
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,600
or some less precise amount um and that

534
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
way you couldn't see someone's body

535
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,600
shape

536
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,120
which might be an indicator of their

537
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
identity if you already know that about

538
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,160
them

539
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,080
so yeah you can definitely minimize

540
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
identity sensitivity from that data as

541
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,960
well by

542
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,039
by obfuscating these characteristics

543
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,760
through introducing noise or removing

544
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,240
precision

545
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,960
um one example i'm just blown away with

546
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,520
uh

547
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,480
how location tracking still works today

548
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
when it comes to gps in particular

549
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
um so many people don't really need to

550
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,880
share anything beyond their zip code

551
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,200
in order for apps to localize but for

552
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,320
the most part

553
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,840
when people consent to share their

554
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,760
location it's giving very precise

555
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,600
coordinates and

556
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,520
risk has not been minimized yet in the

557
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,000
degree it should be

558
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,559
well what else can we do with this data

559
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,080
that's all the time we have for today

560
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,760
but there's probably a bunch of projects

561
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,679
where applying the ipa triad might be

562
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,880
helpful for you

563
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
if you end up doing something really

564
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
interesting let me know it would really

565
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,919
make my day

566
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,200
if you have a question about these

567
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
slides or a project you want to discuss

568
00:19:51,200 --> 00:20:04,960
feel free to reach out and thank you
