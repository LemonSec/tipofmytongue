1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,320
so i wanted to start with context

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,760
because we're talking about privacy

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,519
audits and that word is used in many

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,080
contexts and so i just want to be clear

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,640
to start off on the same page that i'm

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,480
talking about the audit of a system

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,238
process or product based on stated

8
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,160
objectives and looking at evidence to

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,920
see if controls are working

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,760
not talking about an investigation to

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,440
determine what went wrong or a

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
regulatory investigation or a code

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,399
review or a pen test

14
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,440
so

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,600
why are we talking about a privacy audit

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
well maybe you are in-house privacy

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,079
professional uh you were selected for

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,800
privacy audit maybe you are hiring a

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
service provider to do

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,520
processing on your behalf or with you

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
maybe you're subject to gdpr fulfilling

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,479
obligations as a data processor or a dpo

23
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,479
maybe you're canadian or you just like

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,240
canadians and you like to follow the

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,799
guidance of our privacy regulators

26
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,479
in the getting to accountability right

27
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,560
guidance there's lots of reasons why you

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,880
might be interested in privacy audit

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,520
maybe you are one of the many companies

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
who are subject to an ftc consent decree

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,479
that says that you have to hire a third

32
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,200
party to do annual audits for a given

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,720
number of years as part of your

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,200
settlement

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,280
so what is a privacy audit i'm going to

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,360
start out by grossly oversimplifying

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,680
this and at the end of my talk you will

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
understand why i'm working so hard to

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,479
keep it simple because it is work uh an

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,799
audit answers the question do we have

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,280
evidence that this thing was doing what

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
it said it would do so let's break that

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,560
down

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
do we have evidence

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
we being the auditor not somebody who's

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,960
qualified independent and working on

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
behalf of an organization

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
audits are done by auditors for

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,399
organizations they're not for

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,758
individuals

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,160
and evidence uh in an audit if there's

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,480
no evidence it didn't happen even if the

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
result or the outcome is correct a

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,560
hundred percent of the time if you can't

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,040
document how it came to be uh it can't

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,520
pass an audit

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,599
okay this thing do we have evidence this

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,440
thing this thing has to be narrowly

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
defined the scope could be a system a

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,080
process a product or an app it's not the

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,959
organization as a whole

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,519
audits are backward looking and cover a

63
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
defined period or point in time

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,120
and so was it doing what it said it

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,599
would do this is important audits check

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,840
against stated objectives and generally

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,760
those are not set by the auditor because

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
the auditor must be independent the

69
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
objectives could be set by the oddity or

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,920
a privacy framework and i'm going to

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,760
give you a specific and real example of

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,519
this in just a moment

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680
but just to be very clear about what an

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,239
audit doesn't doesn't say uh it does not

75
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
answer the question is this thing

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,440
trustworthy

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,000
that's neither specific nor objective

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
uh it doesn't answer the question does

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,920
this thing work because an audit is

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
backward looking so the closest we could

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
get is to have evidence that it was

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,238
working

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,560
all right so if it doesn't say all of

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,640
that what does it say i'm going to show

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,360
you an example this one is

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,239
ripped from the headlines it is uh

87
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000
it is the pwc audit of facebook in 2017

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
and i'm using this one not to pick on

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,080
either of those companies but it is a

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,319
rare example of an audit report being

91
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,959
publicly available they're restricted

92
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,799
use and they're subject to strict

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,720
confidentiality requirements so usually

94
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,640
we don't get to see them unless we're

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,799
part of the intended audience

96
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,480
this is also a great example of the

97
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,200
limitations of privacy audits given this

98
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,360
opinion was issued while facebook was

99
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,959
aware of a data leak to cambridge

100
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,680
analytica that led to a 5 billion

101
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
settlement for facebook and scrutiny

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,840
about the independence of auditors that

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,959
are hired by the oddity

104
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,079
so let's go slow

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,759
in our opinion

106
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,199
in this case pwc is the auditor um as

107
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,280
part of the ftc settlement facebook had

108
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,360
to hire a qualified independent auditor

109
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,520
and that's what pwc is

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,479
facebook's privacy controls

111
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,400
these are mostly redacted but we do have

112
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
some controls related to third-party

113
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,479
developers um and i'm going to show you

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,199
those in just a moment

115
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,199
we're operating with sufficient

116
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,919
effectiveness now we don't have pwc's

117
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,199
test procedures um but generally when

118
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,520
testing controls the auditor is going to

119
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,759
figure out the total population

120
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
choose a sample and set a tolerance and

121
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,080
there are methodologies for doing this

122
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,919
and they're going to look for evidence

123
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,720
to see if that control was working based

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
on that sample

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
so a simple example of this would be

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,160
related to data subject access requests

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,880
for dsars you'd want to test the control

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
around verifying someone's identity

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,320
before releasing data to them you would

130
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
look at the total number received say

131
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
it's a hundred

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
choose a sample say 10 and then you'd

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,160
look at evidence to see if in those 10

134
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
instances the person's identity was

135
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
verified maybe you have evidence in the

136
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,120
form of an attestation or a copy of

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
information that they provided

138
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,479
okay this next part this is where

139
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,639
lawyers get involved i'm tight on time

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,759
so i'm not going to read out the whole

141
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,400
thing

142
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
uh basically this is the what it said it

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,680
would do

144
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,759
part uh that i said earlier was it doing

145
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,919
what it said it would do um

146
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,639
we're gonna go come back to this um

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,639
this is the caveat this is what narrows

148
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,360
that scope

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,680
and um is it doing what it said it would

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,479
do based upon the privacy pro the

151
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,560
facebook privacy program

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
set forth in management's assertion and

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,199
in this case we have management's

154
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
assertion

155
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,400
okay here's what that looks like

156
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
facebook discloses covered information

157
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
to third party developers only for the

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
purposes identified and the notices and

159
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
with the implicit or explicit consent of

160
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,840
the individual so facebook wrote this

161
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,319
pwc didn't write this ftc didn't write

162
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,919
this and it didn't come from one of the

163
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,840
frameworks uh one of the privacy

164
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
frameworks that i'm going to discuss in

165
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,080
a moment um they facebook set this bar

166
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,318
for themselves

167
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
so i'm going to summarize here

168
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
but you can read this

169
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,759
the full report is available online and

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,840
the slides will also be available

171
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,479
basically controls include having

172
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,759
policies in place uh requiring the third

173
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
parties to agree to the policies in some

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,199
cases a manual review was required

175
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,160
and also obtaining consent

176
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
and limiting the disclosure based on

177
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,599
that consent pwc tested these controls

178
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,280
again we don't know how but they

179
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
determined that for that given period of

180
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,639
time that they were operating

181
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
effectively

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,680
so that's an example of where uh the

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,240
oddity sets the bar for themselves what

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,199
if

185
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,440
they had instead used a privacy

186
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,479
framework

187
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,919
so there are a number of privacy

188
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,160
frameworks i have three of my favorite

189
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
ones linked

190
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,120
here on the screen and they're all

191
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
linked

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,160
starting with the aicpa trust services

193
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,400
criteria that's my favorite one because

194
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,560
deep down in my heart i'm still an

195
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
auditor um and i worked on its

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,199
predecessor the generally accepted

197
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,160
privacy principles um i like this one

198
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,919
because it has a lot of illustrative

199
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,400
controls and it shows you how to test

200
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,280
them

201
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,479
in the associated guidance and it's free

202
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,199
i love the new nist privacy framework

203
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,720
and since we're at an engineering

204
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
conference i'm sure you love it too and

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
i saw in the chat there were some

206
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,599
questions about it with the last talk um

207
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,319
i love this one because it it really

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,000
goes further on explaining and requiring

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,800
the the company to look at

210
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,599
risk and data control and then finally

211
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,160
iso 27701

212
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,639
is also a very popular privacy audit

213
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,599
framework uh it's extremely robust it's

214
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,280
much more global in nature it's quite

215
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
well aligned with gdpr and other

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
um other privacy laws but what i don't

217
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
like about it is that it's a little bit

218
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
expensive it's proprietary you have to

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,559
pay for it

220
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
okay so what if we used one of those

221
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
frameworks instead of facebook's

222
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,279
management as insertion um

223
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
it's not my day for this okay sorry

224
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
all right um controls around the

225
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,360
policies are consistent between

226
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
facebook's management assertion and all

227
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,120
three frameworks it's what we expect

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,360
it's the foundation of pretty much um

229
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,000
any control is that it is documented and

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,959
formally defined

231
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,360
okay next up uh next next requirement um

232
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,200
in the facebook's management assertion

233
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
was around agreements and commitments

234
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
and here we start to see things a little

235
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,920
bit different so all of them require

236
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
agreements to be in place the aicpa

237
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,560
framework goes a step further

238
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,600
to require ongoing due diligence around

239
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
compliance with the contract and taking

240
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,760
corrective action if it isn't being

241
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,319
adhered to

242
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,440
consent was another control um here we

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,720
also see a difference um all three of

244
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,640
facebook trust services and nist

245
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,399
required consent to be

246
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,720
obtained and then respected you only

247
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,640
disclose data in accordance with that

248
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,240
consent but under iso 27701

249
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
we see a requirement for downstream

250
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
notification of changes so if you've

251
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,440
been working with gdpr that's not

252
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,519
unfamiliar to you and i've said before

253
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,959
iso is much more aligned with gdpr so

254
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,320
this is where we start to see the

255
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,880
differences

256
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
and then finally and i think this one's

257
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,560
really important

258
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,800
management's assertion at facebook did

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,079
not

260
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,040
cover

261
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,200
records of disclosure and that does not

262
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
mean that they don't do it it just

263
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,959
wasn't in scope for this audit

264
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,200
had they chosen to audit against one of

265
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,360
these frameworks they would have tested

266
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
controls around keeping track of who was

267
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
receiving the data

268
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,680
and so you can see how that looks in all

269
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,800
three of those frameworks

270
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
so are privacy audits effective well

271
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,320
let's ask a question about the question

272
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,000
or a meta question if you will um

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,880
do we have evidence that this thing was

274
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,519
doing what it said it would do

275
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,440
when we think about the audit did the

276
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
audit tell us whether those specific

277
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,040
controls in the management's assertion

278
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,360
were operating sufficiently not

279
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,800
perfectly

280
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,440
as they related to that specific data

281
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,839
that was in scope for that specific

282
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,519
period in time

283
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,160
um according to pwc they were they did

284
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,480
have that evidence and so i think that

285
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,200
the audits did what it said it would do

286
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,519
um audits have a purpose and they also

287
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,839
have limitations and that's clear

288
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,000
um based on the outcome which was that

289
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,640
this audit cleared the privacy practices

290
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,040
uh despite the cambridge analytical leak

291
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,480
if you look at the the the follow-up

292
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
audit which was done by a different firm

293
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
called productivity you see it being a

294
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,079
lot more critical um and you see more um

295
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,519
more robustness in the management's

296
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,880
assertion so hopefully i have done the

297
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
thing that i said i would do and

298
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
provided you with a satisfactory primer

299
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,440
on privacy audits if we've got time for

300
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
questions i would love to hear them

301
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,360
otherwise i'll communicate with you in

302
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,480
the

303
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,040
in the slack
