1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,719
all right hi everybody um so thank you

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,240
giles thank you everyone for having us

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,039
today so our team at the census bureau

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,520
has collaborated with tumult labs to

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,439
explore ways to balance the need for

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,760
accurate statistics while protecting

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
respondents confidentiality in order to

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,800
develop a proposal for producing 2020

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
census data for detailed race and

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,280
ethnicity groups and american indian and

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,960
alaska native tribe and village

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
populations in our 2020 census detailed

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
demographic and housing characteristics

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,079
file a it's a mouthful it's also known

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
as the detailed dhca

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,000
so our proposal for producing 2020

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,160
census detailed race and ethnicity group

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
population counts and characteristics

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
data focuses on tables that have been

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,920
developed in an attempt to balance

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,399
confidentiality requirements and the

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,640
programmatic legal and statistical needs

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,159
of our data users and our stakeholders

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,080
external partner feedback combined with

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,640
our review of table access rates and our

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,159
subject matter expert knowledge has

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,720
informed the development of this product

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,320
and we're planning to produce data for

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,000
more detailed recent ethnicity groups

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,640
than we ever have before but at many

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,119
fewer geographic levels as well as fewer

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,119
and less detailed tables to balance

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,000
accuracy and confidentiality

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
our highest priority at the census

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,119
bureau is to provide the most accurate

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,640
data possible for the critical

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,960
statistics needed by detailed population

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,079
groups

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,640
so what is the detailed dhca

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,240
this is the data product where data

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,640
users will be able to access data on

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,720
detailed race and ethnic groups like

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,119
chinese mexican lebanese the navajo

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
nation and many many many more

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,479
we're also planning to write statistics

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,479
on sex by age for detailed race and

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
ethnicity groups now all groups will

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,439
receive sex by age data this will also

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,439
be determined based on the size of the

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,600
detail group in a specific geographic

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
area

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
some data users have asked us to include

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
lower levels of geography for places

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,479
like cities and towns

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,038
and also for census tracts so we're

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,879
evaluating the feasibility of including

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,800
these and adding them to the list of

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
geographies we're already planning to

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
produce data for which includes nation

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
states counties an american indian

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
alaska native and native hawaiian areas

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
and through our ongoing engagement with

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,959
the public and any use cases that they

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,959
provide to us we've been able to learn

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,640
more about the critical needs for these

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
data which has led us to the decision to

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,959
prioritize this product over other some

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,800
of our other data products

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,640
and this product is planned for release

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,640
next summer in august of 2023

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,319
as i mentioned our highest priority is

72
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,239
to write the most accurate statistics

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,080
for critical data needs especially

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,519
knowing that these statistics on

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,200
detailed race ethnicity and tribes

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,640
they're not available anywhere else we

77
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
don't have any other products with these

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,959
data

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
so our research goals when developing

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,959
this product were to explore how privacy

81
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,879
and accuracy levels can be established

82
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,480
to produce statistics on our nation's

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,200
myriad population groups to find ways to

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
allow for equity across all major race

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,680
and ethnicity categories and strive to

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,519
provide the same amount or more data

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,440
than we provided from the 2010 census

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
through ongoing engagement with the

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,959
public and the use cases that many of

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,959
them have submitted we've been able to

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,480
learn more about the critical need for

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,760
these data

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
this feedback has led us to the decision

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,440
to prioritize this product over some of

95
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
our other products and we've also heard

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
from data users that's important to have

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,120
data on detailed race and ethnicity at

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,879
additional levels of geography like

99
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,959
census tracts and places

100
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,400
so as i mentioned we're beginning to

101
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,640
evaluate if it's feasible to include

102
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,799
these additional levels of geography

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
while still protecting response privacy

104
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,840
and providing accurate statistics

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
we'll have an ongoing dialogue and

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
iterative feedback loop with

107
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
stakeholders and data users about this

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,200
work as our development plans evolve

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,040
we've heard from data users and we

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
understand the critical need for these

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,519
data

112
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,519
this summer we're continuing developing

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,519
and testing to incorporate data user

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,040
feedback

115
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,879
and as part of our ongoing development

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
and testing we're examining whether

117
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,680
accuracy targets we set are being met

118
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,399
next year in january 2023

119
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
we plan to produce a prototype

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
demonstration data product using 2010

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
sensors

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
this data for the detail dhca

123
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,280
and the census data we'll use available

124
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
we'll ask for public feedback and take

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
that into consideration as we find to

126
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,840
the parameters and plans for our final

127
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,199
product and before moving into the

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,479
production phase we'll have additional

129
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,680
engagement with stakeholders and

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
partners and conduct tribal

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
consultations as we work to produce

132
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,440
these 20 20 statistics for our nation's

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
diverse communities

134
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,199
i really appreciate you having me today

135
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
and i'm going to pass in for sam to talk

136
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
about the differential of privacy

137
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,560
algorithm for how we will produce this

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,039
product

139
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
great thanks rachel

140
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,639
um hi my name is sam haney i'm a

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,639
scientist at tamalt labs

142
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,919
and in this section of the talk i'm

143
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,440
going to talk about the differential

144
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
private algorithms that we it's malt

145
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
developed for this problem in

146
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,280
collaboration with rachel's team

147
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
um so before i start i need to show you

148
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,560
this disclaimer

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
tumult has been contracted to develop an

150
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
algorithm but

151
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,240
the census has not yet chosen to use

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,120
this algorithm and any of the numbers i

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,960
present during this presentation are not

154
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
going to be used in production

155
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,759
they're just for illustration

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,840
okay so here are the two main takeaways

157
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,520
that i want you to get from this section

158
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
of the talk

159
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
first that this privacy utility

160
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
negotiation takes time and effort

161
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,639
both from the side of the dp experts to

162
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,080
understand the fitness for use

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,039
requirements and from the domain expert

164
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:53,759
so

165
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,759
rachel and her team to understand what

166
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,080
knobs are available for them to tune the

167
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,600
privacy loss fitness for use trade-off

168
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
and then second i'm going to tell you

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,479
about some of the specific tools and

170
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,120
techniques that we used that might be

171
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,680
helpful in your own applications

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
and i'll start with the former so rachel

173
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
did a good job of presenting what this

174
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,759
looked like from the census side so i'm

175
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,520
just going to briefly show you what this

176
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
looked like from our

177
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,840
perspective

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
okay so here's an overview of the design

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
process we started by understanding the

180
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
problem and some preliminary fitness for

181
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,639
use requirements

182
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
we designed a rough algorithm and we

183
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,160
identified some parameters that

184
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,319
significantly affect the privacy loss

185
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,000
fitness for use trade-off that would

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,039
need to be tuned further

187
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
next we worked with rachel's team to

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
elicit fitness for use requirements and

189
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
help them visualize and analyze the

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,680
privacy loss and fitness for use

191
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,720
trade-off

192
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
and then we iterated on this process and

193
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,440
made adjustments to the proposed

194
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
algorithm and then eventually and this

195
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
is still ongoing we finalize the

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,919
requirements and the algorithm

197
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,120
all right so

198
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,199
now let me tell you about some of the

199
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,680
specific tools and techniques that we

200
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
use

201
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
right so first let's define the problem

202
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
a bit more concretely using this example

203
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
uh so for each combination of geography

204
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
and detailed race and ethnicity group we

205
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,680
want to produce a total count and a

206
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
breakout by age and sex

207
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,560
so

208
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,440
each

209
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
record has

210
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
a geo id

211
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,280
which determines its mapping to

212
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,080
a number of geographies it has a sex an

213
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
age and a set of race and ethnicity

214
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,879
codes that together determine its

215
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,560
mapping to

216
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
a set of race and ethnicity groups

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,240
so for example

218
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,479
maybe this record is tabulated into

219
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,720
these two tables

220
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,360
and then we

221
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,520
it contributes to the appropriate counts

222
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,120
so this was a

223
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,319
female 81 to 84 so this count goes up

224
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,680
and then also contributes to the total

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
um and some just additional criteria

226
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,680
that influenced our algorithm design so

227
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,599
uh first we mainly care about relative

228
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,720
error

229
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,319
second we care about some of the

230
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,400
intermediate breakouts so not the full

231
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
age by sex breakout but we also care

232
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080
about for example the

233
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,479
just the breakout by sex

234
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,080
and then finally the statistics should

235
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,279
be integral

236
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,799
but there are no other consistency

237
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,799
requirements

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
okay so here's like the most basic

239
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,760
differential private differentially

240
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
private algorithm that you could think

241
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
of to solve this problem so for each

242
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,160
statistic we'll just add laplace noise

243
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,279
uh scaled by the sensitivity so this is

244
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,640
discrete laplace noise instead of

245
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,519
laplace noise because these uh these

246
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,440
counts need to be integral

247
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,519
but if you haven't heard of the discrete

248
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,000
laplace distribution it's uh similar to

249
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
laplace

250
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
okay so then starting with this baseline

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
algorithm

252
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
where we present a series of

253
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
modifications to get to our the the

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,800
algorithm that we have ended up

255
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,360
proposing um and so i'm only going to

256
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,040
present sort of the major changes there

257
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
are some minor things that i'm leaving

258
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,399
out

259
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,600
okay so

260
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,680
optimization one is that we want to be

261
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,519
able to adjust the privacy budget

262
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,760
separately for separate

263
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
race and ethnicity and geography levels

264
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,440
so the geographies can be divided into

265
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,200
levels the race and ethnicities can also

266
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,519
be divided into levels such that the

267
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,760
sensitivity so the contribution of one

268
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,120
record within each level is much smaller

269
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
so this by itself doesn't reduce error

270
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,080
but it allows us to tune the privacy

271
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
loss separately for separate levels

272
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
and this is good for two reasons

273
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
one

274
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
is that we care about

275
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
relative error so we can give more

276
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,320
privacy budget to smaller groups that we

277
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,800
expect to be smaller and less privacy

278
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,399
budget to groups that we expect to be

279
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,440
larger

280
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
and so this sort of optimizes the

281
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,519
relative error

282
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
second is that we can you know with

283
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,360
feedback from stakeholders identify some

284
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,079
like some groups that we want to give a

285
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,640
lot of privacy budget to so for example

286
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
if we've decided that

287
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,839
all of the counts at the nation and

288
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,760
state level are really important we can

289
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,519
give much more privacy budget to the

290
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
nation and state counts

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
okay

292
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,079
optimization two is that we adaptively

293
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,320
choose the statistics level using a

294
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,600
fraction of the privacy loss budget

295
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
so we define four statistics levels um

296
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
so total is the total count of the

297
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
of the group sex across age four buckets

298
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
is the sex cross age breakout where age

299
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,399
is grouped into just four groups etc and

300
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,640
these statistics levels are separated by

301
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,399
thresholds that determine

302
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,480
uh which statistics level we want to

303
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
compute based on the group's size

304
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
so we get

305
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,160
some group um european california size

306
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,959
21 000. uh clearly i didn't think enough

307
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,519
to make this a real realistic example

308
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,200
um

309
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
we

310
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,480
used some privacy loss budget to get a

311
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,880
noisy size of the group so maybe it's 19

312
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
000 in this case

313
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
and then based on the thresholds this

314
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,920
gets mapped into the

315
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
sex cross age four buckets and then we

316
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,839
use the remainder of the privacy loss

317
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,839
budget to calculate the statistics at

318
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,720
that statistics level

319
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,200
so we do this so that we can

320
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,959
sorry we do this so that

321
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,880
larger groups we can compute more

322
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
detailed statistics and smaller groups

323
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
we can compute less detailed statistics

324
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,880
so this is the the second idea

325
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,880
all right and

326
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,040
finally we use the discrete gaussian

327
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,639
mechanism and zcdp privacy accounting

328
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,720
so there's a lot to unpack here i'm

329
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,079
going to give you a really brief

330
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,440
overview but i don't have time to go

331
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
into details so if you want to follow up

332
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
with me feel free to do so

333
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,399
all right so first the discrete gaussian

334
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,639
mechanism this is

335
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
almost exactly what it sounds like it's

336
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,560
similar to the laplace mechanism but you

337
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,720
add noise from a discretized version of

338
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,320
the gaussian distribution rather than

339
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,560
the lapos distribution

340
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,040
now the discrete gaussian mechanism

341
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,880
doesn't satisfy pure differential

342
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,079
privacy for any epsilon

343
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,639
but it does satisfy this thing called

344
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,720
zero concentrated differential privacy

345
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,440
or

346
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,120
zcdp

347
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,560
so i won't give you the definition but

348
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,160
sort of the important takeaway here is

349
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
that this is an alternate privacy

350
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,079
definition and it can be converted into

351
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,399
approximate differential privacy

352
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,880
and second this performs really well

353
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,560
when we're composing many queries

354
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,040
all right so

355
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,519
what do we find well

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,959
if we fix

357
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,680
the margin of error

358
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,959
then the

359
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,279
privacy loss

360
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,440
under pure dp compared to the privacy

361
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,639
loss under z cdp is uh moderately better

362
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,240
uh if we use the discrete gaussian

363
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
mechanism and zcdp

364
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,560
so there are some caveats here uh number

365
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,639
one remember that these are not the

366
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,959
production values

367
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,120
as a reminder and

368
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,839
number two these aren't uh completely

369
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,839
comparable because

370
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,639
the first privacy loss the 15.3 is pure

371
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,240
differential privacy

372
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,120
and the epsilon of 12.2 is approximate

373
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
differential privacy with some small

374
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,120
delta

375
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,839
but we chose this delta to be really

376
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,560
small so we think that this is

377
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,720
fairly comparable and then another thing

378
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,160
to keep in mind is you can choose a

379
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,560
a less small a larger delta that's not

380
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,279
quite as um

381
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,839
yeah that's not quite as conservative

382
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
and then the the gap in privacy loss is

383
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,880
even larger

384
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,800
all right so this is the third idea if

385
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
you're composing many queries

386
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,279
zcdp is often a better choice than pure

387
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,320
differential privacy

388
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,800
thank you

389
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,240
you
