00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,639
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,799
my name is yashin yao i'm an assistant

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,400
professor in the department of

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,160
information systems at the university of

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,160
maryland about makani

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,160
today i'll talk about our research on

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,920
informing the design of privacy

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,160
awareness mechanisms in smart homes from

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
users and bystanders perspective

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,880
we've been seeing lots of news headlines

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,719
related to people's privacy concerns and

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,399
the privacy risks associated with smart

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,719
home devices one of the main issues that

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,040
users have to deal with is that

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,719
there are very limited ways for them to

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,840
learn about data practices of smart home

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,600
devices however what makes things the

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
worse is that the data collection in

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,879
smart home

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,559
installer homes does not stop at the

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,640
users because in a smart home setting

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
there are more people involved

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
for example

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,079
in a dorm your roommate's smart speaker

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,039
may record your voice a ups

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,440
driver may be recorded by the security

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
camera without you their awareness

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
or when you are invited to your friend's

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
place for a birthday party your data

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
might be collected by your friends smart

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
devices maybe without your awareness

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,040
in these cases it is also very difficult

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,840
for people to learn about data practices

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,640
we call these people bystanders

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,360
in our research we focus on both users

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,880
and bystanders

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,159
to make it clear

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,640
we define smart home users as those who

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,200
own smart home devices and bystanders as

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
those who do not own smart home devices

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,040
but may be subject to the data

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,240
collection by smart home devices

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,640
on prior research including some of our

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
own research has demonstrated that

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
bystanders do have privacy needs but

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
sometimes those needs conflict with the

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
needs of the users for example

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,680
bystanders may want the device to be off

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
to stop data collection while users may

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,680
want to

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,520
keep the device running for security

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
reasons

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,159
however

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
prior work does not address one of the

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,719
fundamental privacy issues that is how

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
do we make sure users and bystanders are

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,520
aware of the data practices of smart

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
home devices in the first place how do

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
we notify them so now in our research we

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,560
aim to look at this particular issue in

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,360
depth

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
in this talk

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,360
we

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
focus on the first question on the

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,959
screen

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,000
uh we proposed the concept of four

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,640
private privacy awareness mechanisms and

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,959
some prototypes and conducted a survey

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,160
study to see how people react to them

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,920
i'll skip the methodology details in

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
this talk you can find those details in

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,400
our kai 22 paper

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
instead i'll talk about some of the

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,800
findings in particular the perceived

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,959
benefits and drawbacks of four privacy

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,280
awareness mechanisms for from users and

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,920
bystanders perspectives uh more result

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
about the scenario-based comparisons and

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
some some other stuff can be found in

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,599
the paper

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
um so we prepared propose the four

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,920
privacy mechanisms awareness mechanisms

83
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
the first mechanism is a privacy

84
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
dashboard which includes details of the

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
data practice of all smart home devices

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,480
connecting this smart home

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
this is inspired by

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,440
smart hops

89
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,800
which enable

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
centralized control for all smart

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
devices connected to in a home

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,319
it is also inspired by existing smart

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,799
home network monitoring tools uh such as

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,000
the iot inspector which allows people to

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
obtain information regarding the data

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,879
flows from all devices connected to a

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,799
wi-fi network

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,120
in terms of pros and cons both users and

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,440
bystanders believe that a dashboard like

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,599
this would be able to provide detailed

101
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,599
information in a centralized location

102
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,560
however

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,959
both users and bystanders would like to

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,000
have control beyond just notice another

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
drawback as stated by the bystander is

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,360
that

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
to use the dashboard as bystanders they

108
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,519
will basically need to use other

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
people's device in their home even in

110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
some cases this is not a big issue but

111
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,400
in most cases it violates the social

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
norms and can be very awkward

113
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,480
the next mechanism is an app this is a

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,319
very similar idea as the dashboard but

115
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,720
in the format of the app uh in our study

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,040
setting to use it users need to connect

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,440
it to a wi-fi network and the app will

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
scan all devices in network uh

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,520
participants found the app to be very

120
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,199
easy to use and as they um they can

121
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,840
access the access it from their phone

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
which also helps to reduce the social

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
awkwardness it also provides detailed

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,240
information um however some users

125
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
thought the that the the app might have

126
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,600
some security concerns since bystanders

127
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,680
would need to connect to the user's home

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,479
network and scan all connected devices

129
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,280
at the user's home and at the same time

130
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,840
some bystanders believe that this is a

131
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,120
invasion to the user's privacy

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
um for the third and fourth mechanisms

133
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,680
we aim to explore something different

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,479
since we're talking about the internet

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,320
things devices things in the in the home

136
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
setting so why don't we utilize the the

137
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,960
concept of the things

138
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,800
um so we came up with the idea of an

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,639
ambient light so the ambient light is a

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
smart ball based uh product that

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,440
provides users with uh signals regarding

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
the data collection and sharing in their

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,880
smart home

144
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,440
by um changing its color

145
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
uh so this is inspired by the visual

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
cues that are currently available on

147
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,520
smart uh home devices uh such as the led

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,400
light

149
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
led status indicators on smart security

150
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,080
cameras and the led light circle on

151
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
amazon echo

152
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
we ask ourselves why don't we use the

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
visual cues for privacy related

154
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,039
notifications

155
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,039
in this case we use the green light to

156
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,280
represent encrypted traffic get a yellow

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,840
lights to represent the regular traffic

158
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,919
and red light to represent tracking

159
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,080
traffic um this is to uh to replica the

160
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
colors of the traffic light on the

161
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
street uh before i talk about the pros

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
and cons i'd like to show a quick demo

163
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,960
so in terms of the um the person counts

164
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
both the users and bystanders believe

165
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,479
that this is the easy to understand

166
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,440
mechanism uh it also provides an

167
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
unobtrusive notification experience in

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,919
certain cases such as when you are

169
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,360
watching a movie with your kids and you

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
don't really want to be interrupted at

171
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,280
the same time both users and bystanders

172
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
believe that the light is not as

173
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,680
informative and to some bystanders the

174
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,240
light especially the red light might

175
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
cause some psychological burden this is

176
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
because when you are in other people's

177
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,479
place and does not really know what to

178
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,120
expect then suddenly the room turns red

179
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,039
then it can be a little scary

180
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,479
similarly our fourth mechanism instead

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,440
of using the light we use audio cues to

182
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,520
notify users about data practices of

183
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,080
smart home devices so the inspiration

184
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
for pri the privacy speaker comes from

185
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,599
amazon echo

186
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
which use uses audio as a modality to

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
give give out package delivery

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
notifications in our prototype we have

189
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
three types of sound

190
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,319
a pleasant chime sound means encrypted

191
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,880
traffic a single beep sound means

192
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
regular traffic and a scary bus sound

193
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,440
indicates traffic to ads or tracking

194
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,360
servers

195
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,800
similarly i like to show demo key

196
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,479
uh

197
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
okay so in terms of the pros and cons uh

198
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
both users and bystanders believe that

199
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
the speaker is effortless and the

200
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,679
activity notification helps to reduce

201
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,159
social confrontation however similar to

202
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
the light the sound is not informative

203
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,559
and sometimes can be annoying or even

204
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,399
intimidating

205
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,120
uh one interesting uh comparison between

206
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,440
users and bystanders preference is that

207
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
users tend to prioritize device utility

208
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,160
over uh privacy protection well uh

209
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,839
bystanders tend to consider social

210
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,839
factors such as social relationships and

211
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
power dynamics while making decisions to

212
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,760
predict their privacy

213
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,160
this is important because it tells us

214
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,399
that when designing privacy awareness

215
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,279
mechanisms for smart homes there is not

216
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,360
a silver bullet that works for every

217
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
scenario since users and bystanders have

218
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
different priorities

219
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,800
researchers and practitioners need to

220
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
evaluate the specific needs and tension

221
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
based on the specific context we have

222
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,839
more discussion on this result in the

223
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,360
paper so if you're interested please

224
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
check out the paper

225
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,959
uh based on the findings i will

226
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,800
summarize the four implications for for

227
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
practitioners when designing privacy

228
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,959
awareness mechanisms for smart homes so

229
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,279
first uh private notification mechanisms

230
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,279
should provide easy and equal access for

231
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,320
both users and bystanders in some cases

232
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
um they should also consider an um

233
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,920
unobtrusive modality to deliver a

234
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
delivered privacy notice for users and

235
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,160
bystanders especially for those who

236
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,920
prefer to learn about data practices in

237
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
the background at the time when they

238
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
occurred

239
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
third existing privacy noticed and are

240
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,480
device

241
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,720
specific only we found that people are

242
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,279
eager to know about data practices as a

243
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,760
centralized source from all the devices

244
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,320
connecting the smart home um

245
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
so privacy notice that the smart home

246
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,839
level can be a good direction but it

247
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,640
definitely required more research

248
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,800
lastly it is uh very important to

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,959
provide not only privacy notice but also

250
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,440
choice especially for bystanders who are

251
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,519
in a less advantageous position to take

252
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,720
actions

253
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,200
with that a concluded talk thank you for

254
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,800
attention and i welcome any questions
