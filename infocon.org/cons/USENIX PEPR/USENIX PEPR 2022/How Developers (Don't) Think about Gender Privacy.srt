1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,519
i'll be presenting a talk titled how

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,880
developers don't think about gender

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
privacy before i get started i wanted to

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
acknowledge my co-author on this talk dr

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,640
yasmin akar who is at the george

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,640
washington university

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,320
so to get started with a quick overview

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,840
of the talk i'll start by sort of

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,599
describing the problem i may spend a

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,160
little longer on this point than other

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,000
research talks just because

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,039
i have a feeling it's something that

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,120
people aren't necessarily familiar with

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,719
i'll then move to talk about the study

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,600
we did

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,000
talking with developers about gender

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,280
privacy

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,879
particularly we looked at

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,600
data on reddit as well as we conducted

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
interviews with developers

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
finally i'll move to discuss some key

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,280
takeaways for the people in this room

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,160
so to get started what is gender

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,280
it's defined by the american

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,199
psychological association as one's

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,840
internal sense of being male female or

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,559
something else

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,280
sorry

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,360
sorry i have to reference this to be

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
able to see

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,560
so it's ubiquitous in society

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,840
at least

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,240
american society and users may be

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
required to provide it to service

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
providers before they can use software

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,240
so what's the problem with this well

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
there's a few issues that can arise

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,840
in asking about gender

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,680
first if you provide insufficient

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,720
options such as only male or female

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,799
people this presents an accessibility

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,240
issue where people may not be able to

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
access your service second gender

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
identity may change over time so this

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,560
can be someone who

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,759
for example

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,079
was identified at birth as male but then

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,680
transitions to identify as female

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,720
additionally for people who for example

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
maybe aren't out about their true gender

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
identity when you ask about their gender

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,920
it presents a privacy dilemma for them

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,640
if they can't opt out of that question

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,119
and finally gender data may be used in

55
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,800
unexpected or harmful ways often this

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
comes up with people being categorized

57
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,720
for advertising in ways they don't

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,680
expect or are inappropriate and i have a

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
further uh suggested reading if you want

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,120
to learn more about these issues when

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
you get the slides

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,560
so i want to give a sort of illustrative

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,680
example here from the real world uh from

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,640
a co-worker so when they uh accepted a

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,280
job at the company they were working at

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,879
they provided them with three gender

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
options they didn't really know what

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
this was going to be used for

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
they selected the option diverse which

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,519
is a third gender option

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,160
in germany

72
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
when they selected that option

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
they looked at their profile on the

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,599
employer's website and they got this

75
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,879
nice picture

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,519
on the right here which

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,720
sort of

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,319
did two things that they didn't really

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,280
like the first was

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,879
it provided with them with sort of this

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,760
gender uh representation this photo that

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
they didn't identify with but secondly

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,760
uh they weren't out about their gender

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,800
to others in the workplace so when they

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,319
saw this it sort of

86
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,159
inadvertently outed them because there

87
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,159
was no clear indication of how their

88
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,800
gender was going to be used

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
so i think this clearly illustrates two

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,760
of the points i talked about of the

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
previous slide

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,680
so in order to learn more about this

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
issue and where these sort of bad

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,840
examples come from we did a study

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,799
looking at how developers use gender

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,720
data and we started with these three

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
framing research questions here so the

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
first one is

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
how do developers use gen how do

100
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,680
developers ask about gen ask users for

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
gender data

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
second once they have the data how do

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,799
they use it

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
and then finally what advice if any do

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,080
developers receive about

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,439
asking about and using gender data

107
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
so we decided to use a mixed methodology

108
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,319
for this study first we went to just

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,560
practice on reddit

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,480
so this gave us insight into two things

111
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,360
first we could see discussions about

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,760
gender and this was really why we chose

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
reddit over other options such as other

114
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
data sources like stack overflow or

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,800
github because of its more discussion

116
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
oriented nature

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
but additionally we were also able to

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,280
see code snippets where people used or

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
asked for gender

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
second in order to get insight into some

121
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
issues that weren't covered in our

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,479
reddit data we conducted an interview

123
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,000
study with 15 developers

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,759
as i said this allowed us to probe

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,400
issues that were not uh you know present

126
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,880
in our reddit data set

127
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
so i'll start by discussing what we did

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
with reddit

129
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
so in order to collect data

130
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,320
we looked at we took search terms

131
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,199
related to gender and apply them to

132
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,440
and use the reddit api to look for them

133
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,479
on

134
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,160
programming related subreddits like

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
compute rsls computer science our slash

136
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,479
foreign programming

137
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,600
and other such subreddits so from this

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,240
we got over 900 posts with over 10 000

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
associated comments

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
um we couldn't stop there though because

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,479
of our broad search criteria

142
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,560
we had a lot of sort of unnecessary

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
posts

144
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
ones that were not really relevant they

145
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
just used one of the search terms

146
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,199
so that was the vast majority of the

147
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
posts we found

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
the next was a category where people

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,440
were using gender and from this we could

150
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,600
get sort of two data points that i

151
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,400
mentioned here which are

152
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,960
how they're using gender and also how

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,520
they encode or represent gender

154
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,360
and then finally we had a very small

155
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,800
number of posts where people were

156
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,680
actually discussing the use of gender or

157
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
sort of high level concepts about that

158
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,120
so first i'll start by discussing some

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
of the good aspects of what we found on

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
reddit

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
first while there was a small amount of

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,520
discussion about how to use gender the

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
advice that people generally received

164
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,360
when they asked about it was inclusive

165
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,000
yeah unfortunately uh the vast majority

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
of posts on reddit where we observe

167
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
gender being used in practice use

168
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
uninclusive options the most common uh

169
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
representation of gender overwhelmingly

170
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
in the post where we could identify a

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,880
representation of gender was a binary

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
representation

173
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
additionally

174
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,840
we observed

175
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,080
a variety of uses but the the most

176
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
common was for audience demographics

177
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
which

178
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
again most cases we could not identify

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,960
how they were using it just because

180
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
these are small code snippets but for

181
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
those that we could what we found was it

182
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,479
was most often being used for

183
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,039
advertising or other demographic

184
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,039
purposes

185
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,479
so now i'll move to discuss what we

186
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,120
found uh the interview study

187
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
so um there were a lot of things that

188
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,199
just were not covered on reddit because

189
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
people weren't talking about them

190
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,400
and so

191
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
we

192
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
had a broad inclusion criteria uh for

193
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,039
our interview study uh inc so basically

194
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,440
anybody with a year of work experience

195
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,319
in development or a computer science or

196
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,120
programming related degree

197
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,759
um recruitment was conducted on twitter

198
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,759
as well as on the freelancing platform

199
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,960
upwork

200
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
about two-thirds of our participants

201
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
came from upwork

202
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,800
um

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,039
and yeah data was analyzed using

204
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,039
qualitative coding after data collection

205
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,639
was complete

206
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,440
so what did we find in our interviews

207
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
perhaps somewhat surprisingly

208
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
the plurality of our interviewees

209
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,039
preferred more inclusive options so this

210
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,879
is sort of an example quote when we

211
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,400
asked about

212
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
what how they would ask for gender this

213
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,199
person stated that they would ask for it

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
using a text entry and sort of giving

215
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,560
people that free form option

216
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,400
as with reddit the most common use case

217
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
that people cited was audience

218
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,479
demographics again this sort of suggests

219
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,960
some sort of advertising purpose rather

220
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,840
than uh gender being used for some

221
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,879
centrally important task

222
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,639
moving forward um

223
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,000
another thing we noticed in our

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,919
interviews was that most developers as

225
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,599
you might expect we're not really

226
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,159
familiar with the topic area

227
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,240
so questions often had to be repeated or

228
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,719
reiterated or explained in more detail

229
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,159
one interviewee

230
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,399
and as i conclude discussing this study

231
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,480
i want to point out one interview e we

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,519
had

233
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
was specially recruited because they had

234
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,240
worked previously on a platform for

235
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,519
trans-identifying individuals

236
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,080
so this person

237
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
so the platform did not actually

238
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,399
represent gender directly rather they

239
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,560
allowed people to

240
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
represent their identity using tags on

241
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
posts and create community that way and

242
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
i think this is for social media

243
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
platforms and things like that probably

244
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,279
a better option than asking for gender

245
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,160
so to conclude i want to summarize some

246
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
key takeaways here first while we saw

247
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,480
positive signs especially in our

248
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
interviews um

249
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,519
i think that more direct

250
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,839
standards need to be set on how people

251
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,640
collect gender data in order to

252
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,760
make it uh make software more accessible

253
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,320
for everyone

254
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,480
additionally software should accommodate

255
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,880
people who

256
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,600
cannot provide their gender for privacy

257
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
reasons or

258
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
have genders which fall outside the

259
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
binary

260
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
and finally unnecessary collection of

261
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,480
genders should be eliminated as much as

262
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
possible

263
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
of course it's not always possible to

264
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
eliminate gender as something you're

265
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
collecting there may be valid reasons

266
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
why you need it so

267
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
for some quick advice on how to approach

268
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
that

269
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,519
keep in mind that gender is a social

270
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,079
construct that can't be

271
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
encapsulated into a single boolean

272
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
the purpose should be clear to people so

273
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,480
if there's a financial or legal reason

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
which you need to collect gender data

275
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
providing to that providing that to

276
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
people will give much more clarity on

277
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
how they should approach the form

278
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,240
and finally the software should

279
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
accommodate people who cannot provide

280
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,760
their gender

281
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,040
uh

282
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
oh excuse me the software should

283
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
accommodate people who need to change

284
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
their gender over time

285
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,920
either for

286
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,880
reasons

287
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,000
such as transitioning or because

288
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,360
their gender identity changes

289
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,120
and finally if you take nothing else

290
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
away from this talk

291
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,560
if your gender option is only male or

292
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,000
female you're doing it wrong
