1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,360
uh greetings from new york again my name

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
is danny huang i am an assistant

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,519
professor at nyu

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,560
so three years ago my team and i started

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,000
a project

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,240
we collected the network traffic from

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,960
iot devices from thousands of smart

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,359
homes around the world and today

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,519
i'm going to tell you about what we did

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,800
what we learned

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,680
and what challenges we faced

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
we study starts the smart home because

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,079
they're getting increasingly complex and

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,160
they're creating potential security and

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
privacy problems so

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,840
many smartphone networks include a large

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,120
number of devices both iot and non-iot

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,280
there could be devices that be listening

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
to you like this one amazon echo

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,199
or devices watching you like this one a

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,840
camera baby monitor devices that could

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,079
track your video streaming habits like

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,160
what smart tvs

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,239
devices that could you can just remotely

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,320
run on and off like light bulbs but they

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,640
could be running an old embedded linux

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,119
version that might be compromised

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,520
and on top of all these smart iot

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,479
devices there could be non-iot devices

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,799
like personal phones personal computers

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,720
and corporate phones and corporate

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,640
computers because hey

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,840
more and more people work from home

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,119
these days and all these devices are

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,520
typically housed on the same

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,759
trusted network

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,320
same trusted network

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
they can just talk to each other

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,159
no barriers we don't know if they're

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,119
passing

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,200
i don't know scientific information to

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,119
each other we don't know if malware

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,280
moves from one to another we just don't

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,159
know

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,680
and you don't know

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,439
because the security and privacy issues

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,680
of smart home devices and networks

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,960
can be rather opaque to both users and

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,240
researchers so let's start with users

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,399
let's say i'm a typical user

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,840
a bunch of iot devices they're just what

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
black boxes

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,280
i don't know what they're talking to who

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
they're talking to what they're doing i

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,800
don't know what's happening on my

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
network

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
there could be two there are tools like

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,760
wireshark pcb but i as an average user

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,120
would have no idea how wireshark works

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,640
no idea how tcp dunk works that's

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,319
that's like tools for highly uh

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,800
technical individuals so that's from a

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
user's point of view to one of the

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
researchers

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
so as a researcher

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,200
security privacy issues are opaque

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,599
because of the lack of data

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,519
i may have to purchase different iot

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,200
devices and observe their behaviors in

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,680
the lab it may not i may not have the

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920
money to buy thousands of them and this

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,840
limits the scale

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
if you want to study a large number of

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,400
real-world devices i could maybe ask

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,760
company x

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,680
in the audience to provide their data

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,280
for their private data

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,120
this approach probably works but it

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,200
makes it difficult for other researchers

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
who don't have access to replicate my

81
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,040
findings

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,239
so in short

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,599
users no friendly tools and researchers

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,239
it's hard to get large-scale open data

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,519
sets

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
and with all these problems in mind we

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
developed an open source tool called iot

88
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
inspector

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,200
tldr is a monitoring tool for smart home

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,319
users and it crowdsources real-world iot

91
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,519
traffic data set for researchers

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
on one hand it helps average users

93
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
visualize what's going on in their smart

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,319
home networks so here's how it works

95
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,360
a user turns on their computer at home

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,599
the user downloads iot inspector to the

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,640
computer

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,200
the user then runs iot inspector

99
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
iot inspector automatically captures

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,159
traffic of iot devices on the home

101
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,400
network using a technique called arp

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
spoofing arp smoothing

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,760
in other words

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,519
the user doesn't even need any

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,000
additional hardware just run iot

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
inspector and capture analyze and

107
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,319
visualize network traffic without

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,920
additional hardware without additional

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
changes to the router basically a few

110
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,000
clicks and users can see the

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,040
visualization so that's for users

112
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,439
and here's an example of iot inspectors

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,440
visualization so at the top of the

114
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,238
screen uh is actually me watching the

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,840
cbs news on roku tv using cbs news app

116
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
played at 10 times the speed

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,120
at the bottom is the real-time analytics

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
uh real-time analysis of iot inspector

119
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,080
let me just continue playing uh looking

120
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,320
back uh the horizontal axis here uh

121
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,560
shows the time and the vertical axis

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,040
is the kilobits per second uploaded so

123
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
every colored bar is an advertising and

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
tracking service

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
so remember here i'm just passively

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,639
watching the news streaming the news and

127
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,960
the tv is communicating with what three

128
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,800
or four different advertisers including

129
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,199
google and adobe marketing cloud if you

130
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
look at you know the legend really

131
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
carefully here down there

132
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,600
so that's one example of a user that's

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
me in this case running iod inspector

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,800
basically we launched iot inspector in

135
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,039
2019 april 2019

136
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
since then um inspector has collected

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
the network traffic from more than 63

138
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,360
000 devices

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,240
note that this is traffic metadata like

140
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,479
the remote ip addresses host names and

141
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,360
ports

142
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
no payload

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,560
and this data is aggregated over five

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
second windows more details in the paper

145
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,080
and these 63 000 plus devices belong to

146
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,840
some 6400 plus iot inspector users we

147
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
didn't pay them they just downloaded the

148
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,120
tool on their own

149
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,919
these users are anonymous but a few

150
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,240
individuals have come out and identified

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,000
themselves publicly including reporters

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
from npr

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,280
national public radio and washington

154
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
post

155
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,479
these folks used iot inspector to

156
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,160
investigate privacy risks of smart tvs

157
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,919
and to our knowledge

158
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,120
this is the largest open data set of

159
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
real-world iot traffic

160
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,960
and a number of ongoing research

161
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,360
projects are leveraging this large data

162
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
set that includes a study that we

163
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,520
published in ccs a few years ago on

164
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,720
smart home i'm sorry on smart tv privacy

165
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,600
uh we're building uh an iot firewall

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
based on allow lists

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
we're looking into how iot devices

168
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
encrypted network traffic with tls and

169
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
we're studying the public key

170
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,800
infrastructure of iot devices

171
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
we're studying like the software supply

172
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,680
chain

173
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,280
of vulnerable devices and we're looking

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,800
into privacy security issues and

175
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
usability issues in a smart home space

176
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,360
as usual so so this is just a tip of the

177
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,919
iceberg the current state of the iot

178
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,240
inspectors research and from both users

179
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
point of view and from a researcher's

180
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
point of view

181
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,400
it's been what three years since we

182
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,479
launched the iot inspector

183
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,800
we've been um continuously capturing

184
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
data operating infrastructure and

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
attracting users

186
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,000
and in the rest of this talk i'd like to

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,919
talk about some of the lessons learned

188
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,198
and the challenges that we face

189
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,520
challenge number one

190
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,880
identifying devices and labeling devices

191
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,520
this is um in response to the question

192
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,960
from users common question from this

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,919
user

194
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,400
like what is this device

195
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,319
so here's what i mean

196
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,080
when the user runs iot inspector for the

197
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
first time inspector typically shows a

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,080
list of devices like here on the left

199
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,759
the user can choose one or multiple

200
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,240
devices to inspect and have the traffic

201
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,639
captured and view the analysis

202
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,919
the problem is

203
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,000
which is

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,680
which

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
many users have a dozen or so like

206
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
myself have 30 devices

207
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,960
in their house

208
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,400
these devices

209
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
are typically identified by ip addresses

210
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
mac addresses

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,720
an iot inspector has some ways to guess

212
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,560
which devices which but there's

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
definitely room for

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,080
improvement in many cases we just don't

215
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
know what this device is

216
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
expressive device like what is it

217
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,759
many

218
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,240
many iot devices use expressive as the

219
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
uh the chip maker

220
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,919
so we have to use these features to

221
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,280
guest the device so far uh that includes

222
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,039
the oui basically the first three bytes

223
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
of the mac address but you know

224
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,400
this may not may or may not be the

225
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,199
actual manufacturer like google may use

226
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,840
google oei but many smaller you know

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,479
smart plugs they use expressive as a

228
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,440
generic

229
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
chip maker for the wireless chip so

230
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,240
sometimes not very helpful

231
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,440
and we look at sometimes dhcp host name

232
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,599
may be helpful when you have

233
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,519
some devices they announce themselves

234
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,120
via dhcp

235
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,760
same with hdb use user agent

236
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,279
only in cases where the traffic is

237
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
unencrypted but some cases you see

238
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,640
things like what pearl what is that

239
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,959
sometimes mdns and ssdpupnp

240
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,800
announcements where devices announce who

241
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
they are like a chromecast

242
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,399
and sometimes the host names being

243
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,080
contacted may be helpful for for

244
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,040
instance a roku tv would probably most

245
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,600
most likely contact roku.com

246
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
so in addition to

247
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,240
you know inferring all these uh devices

248
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
using all these features

249
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,720
iot inspector also asks users to label

250
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
their devices with the names and

251
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,800
manufacture of devices

252
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
this is a crowdsourcing effort

253
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
so effectively we've crowdsourced device

254
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
identities from users but the user

255
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
labels can be

256
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
messy at times

257
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,399
there are three problems basically with

258
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,920
user labels

259
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,880
missing labels inconsistent labels and

260
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,440
at the bottom wrong labels

261
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
missing labels

262
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,040
slightly less than half of the users

263
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
labeled at least one of their devices

264
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
telling us the names and manufacturers

265
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,560
of devices and of all the devices

266
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,640
roughly 25 percent

267
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
have user labels so that's missing

268
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,000
labels

269
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
and they're inconsistent labels so

270
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,160
currently users label their devices

271
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,839
through what you see uh right here on

272
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,040
the screen a

273
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
user interface

274
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,560
where you know users are showing a drop

275
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,040
down box where they select uh names and

276
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
manufacturers of devices in a drop down

277
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
box but we know that we can't possibly

278
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
list all kinds of devices and drop down

279
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
box so we let users type whatever they

280
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,519
want

281
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,959
it's a problem

282
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,519
sometimes users type amazon echo

283
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
sometimes users type amazon alexa

284
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
sometimes in this case users type amazon

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
ai system like which one of these i mean

286
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
they're the same thing but these appear

287
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,880
as three different labels in their data

288
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
set so that's a problem inconsistent

289
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,519
labels

290
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,560
and then there are the wrong labels we

291
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,200
have seen cases of what looks like a

292
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
smart fan communicating with some large

293
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,560
number of some larger domains including

294
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,880
some android specific domains and we

295
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
check this particular smartphone model

296
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,200
it does not run android so potentially

297
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,320
um the device is labeled incorrectly

298
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
so in short

299
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
we can gather a large data from real

300
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,240
world users but we need to improve the

301
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,800
label quality and quantity

302
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,560
so that's a problem challenge number one

303
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,640
challenge two

304
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
how to communicate risks to users

305
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
without sometimes spooking them

306
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
typically we answer this question from

307
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,839
user like what is my device doing

308
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,600
so earlier we showed you this particular

309
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,959
video of me watching the news on the

310
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
roku tv while running iot inspector if

311
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,440
you remember every colored bar here

312
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,120
shows an advertising and tracking

313
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,240
service

314
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,959
and

315
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,800
how do we know an advertiser

316
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,279
well we look at the dns traffic um and

317
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,120
what if and match against known

318
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,200
blacklists for advertisers

319
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
but what if certain dns packets are

320
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,279
missing or just cached

321
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,560
when it happens

322
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
inspector doesn't know what company

323
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
device is talking to

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
so here's an example if you squid hard

325
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,480
at the bottom here's an example of a

326
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,680
company that we don't know what's going

327
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,279
on like this smart tv is talking to you

328
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,760
live x dot io question mark like we

329
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
don't know what it is because we don't

330
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,320
see

331
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,160
we probably see an ip address we don't

332
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,839
know we don't have the corresponding um

333
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,560
dns packet we don't know

334
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
we haven't seen the sni in client hello

335
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,959
we don't know what the you know who the

336
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,120
the tv is talking to just one example

337
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
and even if inspector knows the remote

338
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
host name the user may not know what the

339
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
remote host name means in terms of

340
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
device's activity

341
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
so real example

342
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,639
belkin wemo smartplug

343
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,639
many of them talk to this domain

344
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,680
hostname called api.xbcs.net

345
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
what is xbcs.net

346
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,399
it doesn't bear the name of falcon or

347
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,079
wemo the company

348
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,480
and if you visit xbcs.net in browser

349
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,880
there's no web server

350
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,120
basically it's hard to tell what xbcs is

351
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
doing

352
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,079
what it is and what the device is doing

353
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,399
and the truth on the other hand could be

354
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,600
spooky

355
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,040
and sometimes so real story we had a

356
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,519
user email us they said

357
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,519
oh my god my device is communicating

358
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,120
with the military domain that's shown on

359
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,079
the screen

360
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,040
is the military uh spying on me

361
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,800
so it turns out that this domain isn't

362
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,959
an ntp time server

363
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,720
there are thousands of thousands of time

364
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
servers in the world it just so happens

365
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,680
that this person's smart device is using

366
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,240
this particular time server operated by

367
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,200
the navy so in general it's tricky how

368
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
to communicate device activities to

369
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,839
users

370
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,079
information could be missing

371
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,720
it is not missing we need to be careful

372
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,880
how to communicate it and not spook the

373
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,800
users especially if you don't have a

374
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,959
strong technical background like in this

375
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,359
particular case

376
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
third challenge incentivizing users

377
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,000
basically how do we convince more users

378
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,120
to use

379
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,839
and keep using iot inspector

380
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,160
this after all is a crowdsource study we

381
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,720
need more users and more user

382
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,120
engagements and since we don't pay them

383
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,199
we build a better product a better

384
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,519
product for them

385
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,880
so let me show you some stats first

386
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,279
our users have collectively scanned for

387
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,240
more than 200 000 devices as represented

388
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,279
by this horizontal bar

389
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,720
users inspected about a third of these

390
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,320
devices meaning that they had iot

391
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
inspector capture and analyze the

392
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,320
network traffic for about a third of

393
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
these devices

394
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,760
these devices correspond to about 6 400

395
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,959
users

396
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,120
but the median duration of running

397
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,240
inspector is about 40 minutes

398
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,480
and remember we want not just the

399
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,399
traffic we also want labeled devices in

400
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,040
particular which device

401
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,279
generated which traffic

402
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,320
flow

403
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,040
only about a quarter of the devices were

404
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,240
labeled and these correspond to about 2

405
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
900 users who label the names and

406
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,360
manufacturers of devices

407
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,160
so

408
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,800
there's definitely room for improvement

409
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,920
for instance longer duration beyond 40

410
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,320
minutes can we encourage users to run

411
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,040
inspector for days for weeks

412
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
can we get more users to inspect more

413
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,279
devices and label more devices more

414
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,839
incentives

415
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,839
and since we're not paying users we can

416
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,000
potentially attract more users and keep

417
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,959
them engaged longer by building a better

418
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,120
product one with better user interface

419
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
and better user experience for example

420
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
by offering more usable information

421
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
about what their devices are doing

422
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,480
behind the scenes and we're right now

423
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,240
partnering with consumer reports digital

424
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,040
apps

425
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,360
to create a much better user experience

426
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,279
one that is tailored toward

427
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,519
average consumers who are concerned

428
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,560
about uh securing privacy and data usage

429
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,199
in smart homes

430
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,279
we can also increase the duration use by

431
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,160
deploying inspector on raspberry pi's

432
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,120
a

433
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
similar project is pai ho which runs on

434
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,399
raspberry pi's and blocks advertising

435
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,600
traffic

436
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,519
using a known block list

437
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,440
it shows a nice you know it's nice

438
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,000
looking dashboard so this is where you

439
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,440
know we're trying to learn some lessons

440
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,680
too

441
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,759
we ran a number of focus groups users

442
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,880
and one common theme is that users want

443
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,079
not just

444
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,720
transparency information but they also

445
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,600
want

446
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,160
actions actions actions

447
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,759
and one aspect we can learn from the pi

448
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,560
whole project is blocking can we let

449
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,399
users block devices and certain

450
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
connections so let's say a user has an

451
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,279
indoor camera can the inspector block

452
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,120
the camera when users at home but

453
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,440
unblock the camera when users out

454
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
so these are some of the work in

455
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
progress for the upcoming inspector

456
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,839
version

457
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
and also some users take inspector

458
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,759
outside to the homes

459
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,079
can they do that so a few days ago i saw

460
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,600
this tweet someone checked into the

461
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,680
airbnb apartment and found this you know

462
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,240
hidden cameras disguised as sprinklers

463
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,439
can users bring iot inspector to air b's

464
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,919
airbnb to discover hidden devices or

465
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,319
some of the ethical issues so we're some

466
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,079
reasonable things that are keeping us

467
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,559
busy right now

468
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,119
so lots of questions lots of open

469
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,319
challenges

470
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,400
um the past three years have been an

471
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,000
eye-opener for us

472
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,559
we gather a large traffic data set from

473
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,120
a large number of users around the world

474
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
we faced a lot of challenges and we

475
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,039
learned a lot

476
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,720
i'm happy to take any feedback from the

477
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
audience and make our inspector even

478
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,760
better for users and researchers

479
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
my name is danny huang we can chat

480
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
offline you can find my contact

481
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,919
information down here and visit my

482
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,880
website

483
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,919
yeah q a time
