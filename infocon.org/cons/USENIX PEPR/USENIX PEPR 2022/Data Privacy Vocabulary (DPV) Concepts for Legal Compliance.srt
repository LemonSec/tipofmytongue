1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,320
hi i'm harsh a postdoctoral research

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
fellow at the adapt center trinity

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,880
college dublin in ireland and today i

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,720
will be presenting the data privacy

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,439
vocabulary

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,480
the dpv is essentially

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,640
encapsulation of knowledge and semantics

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
associated with information regarding

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,359
data privacy and data protection

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,079
what this mumbo jumbo basically means is

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,079
that it's a bunch of concepts with

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,239
relations between them or what the cool

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,320
kids call these days knowledge graphs

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,399
the core concepts within dpv

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
include things such as data controllers

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,760
data subjects recipients or entities

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
that are associated with personal data

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,039
the personal data itself what kind of

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,559
operations are happening on personal

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,520
data

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,559
for what purposes under what legal basis

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,640
how the data is secured using specific

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,720
technical and organizational measures

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
and what rights are provided in part of

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,840
this personal data handling or

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,119
processing and each of these core

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,240
concepts are expanded as taxonomies so

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,759
this allows you to express whether that

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
personal data is sensitive or belonging

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,320
to a special category including specific

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
categories of personal data such as

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,400
email

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,479
web history and so on

34
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,799
specific purposes such as service

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,040
provision selling products

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
specific processing operations such as

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
disclosure of data or sharing data legal

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,119
basis such as contract consent technical

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
organizational measures such as access

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,920
control encryption and entities such as

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
data controllers data subjects

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
representatives and so on

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
of course you don't have to use this

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
model if you don't like it because you

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
can reuse these concepts and create your

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
own data model which is applicable in

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,000
your use cases such as here we have a

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,159
service that has a purpose which has

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,880
processing and that processing defines

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
what third parties are involved what

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,399
data processors are involved what

52
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,400
personal data is involved and so on and

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,640
so forth

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,280
and to express specific jurisdictional

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
concepts such as for gdpr we extend this

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
core vocabulary with additional concepts

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
that are derived from this legal

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,319
documents

59
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,280
for example under gdpr you have specific

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,239
forms of consent such as regular consent

61
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,560
or explicit consent so if you want to

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,800
express that my data simply is based on

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,280
consent you can use the basic or core

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
model in dpv but if you want to be very

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,040
specific and explicit that i want to use

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,840
this form of consent as under gdpr you

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
can express that using the dpv gdpr

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
extension

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
this taxonomical model allows you to

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
express things such as technical

71
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,120
measures as a tree so at the top you

72
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
have the base concept the technical

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
measure then you have slightly less

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
abstract concept such as access control

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,840
methods encryption anonymization then

76
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,440
the next level has slightly more

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,000
concrete and slightly less abstract such

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
as encryption and rest encryption and

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
transfer and the three crypts growing

80
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,239
exponentially or

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,840
basically infinitely because you can

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,519
have any amount of technical measures

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,400
any amount of personal data so we focus

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
on the top concepts in dpv such as

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
access control encryption

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
and so on and so forth

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,040
same for processing you have storage

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
conditions storage duration storage

89
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,360
deletion and so on and so forth and same

90
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,599
for legal entities what this allows you

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,879
to do is express these concrete concepts

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,120
as they are required in legal

93
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,159
documents

94
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,319
and then to specialize them in your use

95
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,959
case for example you can specify that i

96
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,879
use encryption in transfer

97
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,120
annotation whatever specific method or

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
standard you use for the encryption

99
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,840
so

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,280
how to use dpv the dpv is a resource

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
that basically provides concepts and

102
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
interoperability of those concepts

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,439
across different use cases so this

104
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,599
allows you to say something like i'm

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,079
using this data to do marketing and if

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,160
someone else takes your use case they

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,880
shouldn't reinvent the term marketing so

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
you both have to agree on the term

109
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,479
marketing and this is what the dpv

110
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,120
provides a standardization of concepts

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,199
involved in data processing such as

112
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,600
technical measures personal data and so

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,840
on and you can use these concepts to

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,320
annotate your code your documents your

115
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,800
registry of processes or you can use

116
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,919
them to craft policies scripts tools and

117
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,840
systems to do variety of tasks

118
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
associated with compliance checking or

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
creating an overview or a dashboard of

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,759
your system or any other task that is

121
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,840
associated with how you use personal

122
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,800
data

123
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
it also enables to create guidance for

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
example if you use sensitive data you

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,600
should be doing xyz and if you define

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,759
that okay i use someone's

127
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
specific sensitive attribute dpv will

128
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,759
allow you to discover that that

129
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,600
sensitive attribute is a kind of

130
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
sensitive personal data and therefore

131
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,759
that guidance or legal obligation allows

132
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
to allow applies to you

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,039
so this knowledge comes from a variety

134
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,639
of sources laws iso iec standards

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,880
authoritative documents and frameworks

136
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
provided by organizations such as nist

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
and nissa

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,479
and it helps address common pain points

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,320
such as privacy impact assessments and

140
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,720
data types protection impact assessment

141
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
and data transfers where you have very

142
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
abstract requirements in laws but then

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
you have to apply them to very specific

144
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
situations in your use case dpv provides

145
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
the framework within which you can

146
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
express your use case and tie it to

147
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,960
those abstract concepts

148
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199
so this follows the principles of drive

149
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,960
drawn to yourself

150
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
and you can annotate this

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
in your own use case or you can express

152
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
legal requirements using the same

153
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,039
concepts as the law

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,800
and you can verify what your compliance

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
status is and what you need to do

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
and through this enforce good practice

157
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,759
provide guidelines and identify what are

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,600
the options and the best alternatives

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
for your specific use case

160
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,280
of course this allows you to apply dpv

161
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,520
to a wide range of applications such as

162
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,319
policies permissions access control

163
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,240
domains such as banking medicine

164
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
dialogue dashboard

165
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,120
it is

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,080
crazy how much information is usable

167
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
across these different use cases dpv is

168
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,240
not a drop in replacement it is a

169
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
starting point to enable a commonality

170
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
in all these different areas and

171
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
applications and domains

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
of course this comes with his own

173
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,720
challenges there's too much variance

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,400
across the globe there are different

175
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
concepts different terminology there is

176
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,639
no commonality for example what cell

177
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,800
means in california and in europe

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
there's no not even a concept called

179
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,960
cell in europe so dbv

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,800
you know aims to act as a base

181
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
vocabulary which is then specialized for

182
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,639
jurisdictions so this is what is

183
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,280
traditionally the role of iso standards

184
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
and now

185
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
is expanded into things that iso doesn't

186
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
really specify

187
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,240
it also

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
has the challenge of how to integrate

189
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
substandard how to address complex

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
technologies such as use of cookies and

191
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,479
database and algorithms which can vary

192
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,840
or which can be very complex to prove

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,400
and all of this requires participation

194
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
of multi-disciplinary cohorts such as

195
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,479
lawyers data protection experts

196
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,039
developers technical experts authorities

197
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,759
and so on which is why the dpvcg is a

198
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,400
community group whose members are

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,759
experts across all these different

200
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
domains and the dpv represents a sort of

201
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,319
a consensus between these different

202
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,720
cohorts

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
that is all i have to say for now be

204
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
sure to check out dpv and if you have

205
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,599
any questions or suggestions i'm happy

206
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,719
to take them thank you
