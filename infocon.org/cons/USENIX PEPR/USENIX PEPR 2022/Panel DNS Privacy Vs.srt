1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,759
so my

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,720
my co

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,960
panelists are remote actually

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,039
i'm just gonna awkwardly stay uh sit

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,199
here by myself

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
but i'm hoping they got to join mallory

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,840
grisham are you online

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,519
yep we're here

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,679
hello hey

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,920
awesome wish we were there with you but

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,000
thanks for holding it down for us for

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,520
sure um

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,040
and thanks gushybal for joining i know

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
it's like super late in india right now

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,399
but mallory do you want to kick us off

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,480
yeah so i'm going to be moderating the

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
panel um but we're all sort of going to

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,719
participate and i'm really hoping as

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,199
well for audience discussion uh we'll

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,079
leave 10 minutes for q a at the end um

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,360
because this is

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,199
presenting or discussing a work in

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,680
progress um that could really benefit

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,000
from more review and more thinking from

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,479
experts like you all on privacy and

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,520
security um and how those things can

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,720
sometimes come into tension with um

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
what's best in the public interest

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,799
and so let me back up

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
we're going um for this session to uh

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,080
sort of all present an overview

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,159
um of of what we're going to do which is

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,600
what i'm doing now siobhan's going to

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
give a little bit of background

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,759
and basics around the technologies we're

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,479
discussing particularly private dns

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,600
methods um and then generally i'll

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,680
present the outline of the paper and

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,079
what some of the private um sorry public

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,439
interest

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,159
issues come into play or can sometimes

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,720
be a conflict with these new privacy

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,680
preserving protocols then we're taking a

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
couple of those there are about five or

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,680
six um siobhan's going to do a deeper

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,520
dive into what um

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
are some of the tensions with

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,719
consolidation um and competition issues

49
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,320
um

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,360
and then

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
shabbat is going to pick up on another

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
point that's particularly interesting in

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,959
his field of work which is the

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
censorship and the backlash that can

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,879
sometimes come

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,040
as part of new privacy protocols being

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,120
rolled out and then we have a few

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
follow-up questions to sort of go a

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,959
little bit deeper on what we've been

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,280
thinking about for the last few years on

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
this topic and we'll invite you all to

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
join us um in in asking and answering

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
and discussing those questions so that's

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
generally the outline and i will go

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
ahead and ask

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,280
siobhan and gershoba to introduce

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,200
themselves when they first present and

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
i'll go ahead and do that for myself now

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
so um i am the chief technology officer

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,680
at the center for democracy and

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,480
technology here in washington dc

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
um over the past several years i've

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
participated in the internet engineering

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,959
task force and a few other internet

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,360
governance fora especially where there

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,319
are um technical considerations design

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,280
considerations that have something to do

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,440
with human rights i currently chair a

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,599
research group at the irtf internet

80
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,200
research task course on human rights

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
protocol considerations and not long ago

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,760
i was appointed to the internet

83
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
architecture board

84
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,879
so

85
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,319
with that i'm going to hand it over to

86
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,159
siobhan who's just going to go ahead and

87
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,239
do some scene setting with some of the

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,000
technologies that we're going to be

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,840
talking about um just to give everybody

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,159
a baseline understanding um of what

91
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
those are so thanks again for coming go

92
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,799
ahead siobhan thanks mallory so hi all

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,680
i'm siobhan i work on privacy at brave

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
but previously worked on dns privacy at

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,599
salesforce where we were working to

96
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,920
standardize dns zone transfers over tls

97
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,799
and

98
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
yeah i also co-chaired the dns privacy

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
workshop at ndss

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
last year remotely though so this feels

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,480
a lot better um yeah so i'll go ahead

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,319
and give an overview of dns privacy

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,599
protocols

104
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,360
so typically what you're trying to hide

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,799
when it comes to

106
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,519
dns in general is

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
who queried for what so even though the

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,720
dns the information is public it is

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,120
actually pretty sensitive

110
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,959
the fact that a particular client is

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
querying for a particular website so um

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,600
so yeah so and

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,839
that that so when i when we talk about

114
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,160
dns privacy in the session and generally

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,520
i think when people talk about dns

116
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,080
privacy that's what they're referring to

117
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
um so yeah so there are different

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,440
protocols that

119
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
um are involved in the space so there's

120
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
dns over tls and there's dns over https

121
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
and these are i guess two of the older

122
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,680
ones

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
um and more famous ones um so the main

124
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,600
difference between

125
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,919
dns over tls and do

126
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,759
is that

127
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,040
it's importantly

128
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
that dns over tls operates over a

129
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,000
specific port port 853

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,720
which means that it's extremely simple

131
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,800
for a network admin to block

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,440
all dns traffic all encrypted dns

133
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,400
traffic

134
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
and dns over https on the other hand

135
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,240
mixes in your dns traffic with your http

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,639
traffic which makes it a lot harder for

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
someone trying to block to to fine grain

138
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,600
block just the dns queries

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
and um

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
there's most major web browsers today

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,600
ship with dns of https support but they

142
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,560
differ pretty widely in how aggressively

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,360
they

144
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
switch it on by default or how

145
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,759
aggressively they look for

146
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,960
like a

147
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,199
do discovery for when it comes to door

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,240
resolvers and there's also the recent

149
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,479
dns over quick

150
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,240
mechanism which is basically pretty

151
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,320
similar but it's dns over quick and

152
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,039
quick is the the new encrypted transport

153
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,840
layer

154
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
but it's very similar to dns over tls in

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
the sense that it also operates over a

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
dedicated port so it's similarly easy to

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,120
block

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
um so and the issue in kind of these

159
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,160
protocols is that the resolver you're

160
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,759
talking to comes to know the ip address

161
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,240
and the dns query so even though my

162
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,440
query from my laptop to cloudflare or

163
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,000
google or your local isp even if that is

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,319
encrypted um

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,960
my isp or google or cloudflare still

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
come to know

167
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,039
my ip address and what

168
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,199
query i did so you kind of need to trust

169
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
your resolver here

170
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,639
um oblivious dns over https or odo

171
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,400
was kind of invented to solve this

172
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,039
problem based on academic work

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,800
previously it was developed by

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,880
cloudflare and apple and fastly a couple

175
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,400
of years ago and the approach is

176
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,479
slightly different where

177
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,880
the resolver gives a public key to the

178
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,759
client

179
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
and the client encrypts

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,039
their query and then sends it to a proxy

181
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,360
and the proxy all the proxy does is

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
forward this query to the resolver so

183
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,440
this so the two parties involved here

184
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,000
the proxy and the resolver no one party

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
comes to know both the client ip address

186
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
and the query so you're kind of

187
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,199
de-linking those two things so that's

188
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,319
how odo is is some is different

189
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,599
um from

190
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,000
from dns from the other dns proposals

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,080
and this is interesting because it also

192
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,840
kind of muddles up the trust model that

193
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,880
you need to have because now you need to

194
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,720
you're not trusting any one entity so

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,479
it's good in that sense but you're also

196
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,080
kind of hoping that these two entities

197
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
are not colluding together or cannot be

198
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,160
coerced to collude together by a

199
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,759
government or something

200
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
and odo is actually pretty widely

201
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,000
deployed because apple

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
ships it in their private relay for all

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
dns lookups

204
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,758
and yeah that was my intro

205
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,759
yeah thanks siobhan and so i guess then

206
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,240
the next question is what is it about

207
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
these privacy preserving techniques for

208
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,280
hiding dns

209
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,599
that have got people so rattled up about

210
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,440
some of these public interest issues and

211
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
i think we don't have to do a super deep

212
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,680
technical analysis to just speak at a

213
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,240
high level about how disrupting the

214
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,919
ability to

215
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,479
not just um intermediaries like your

216
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,800
resolvers or your isp but this also can

217
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,520
happen for user agents and other parts

218
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,639
of

219
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
the technology stack that now can't see

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,199
um domain lookup data um and because dns

221
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
had for a very long time been totally in

222
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,039
the clear there were a lot of things

223
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,720
that depended on that data or that

224
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
worked because of it including nefarious

225
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,759
things like censor censorship but there

226
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,440
are other things in the public interest

227
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,960
um that were actually

228
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,440
a positive um that also um worked on on

229
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
that or relied on that information and

230
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
so i wanted to just then talk about what

231
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,640
those tensions are which is in our paper

232
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,480
um we go into a lot more detail and then

233
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
of course we're going to take in turn

234
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,120
two specific issues around

235
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
consolidation of the service provision

236
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,600
and then um reactionary censorship

237
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,320
measures um with with siobhan gershwight

238
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,519
in turn

239
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
um so the slate of tensions that this

240
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,959
also the the other impetus i would just

241
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,760
say here um for why we wrote this down

242
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,519
or why we documented

243
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,600
these things was because the criticisms

244
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,360
were coming from a from a variety of

245
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,080
directions so as folks who were

246
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
interested in seeing these privacy

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
preserving protocols get wide adoption

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,399
lots of folks sort of pushing back

249
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,320
against them were saying that they were

250
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,680
doing it in the public interest but

251
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
we're not always

252
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,800
demonstrating that or we're not always

253
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519
coming actually from a civil society

254
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,120
perspective or

255
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
a sort of human rights perspective for

256
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
example governments and others who maybe

257
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,399
had

258
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,800
ulterior motives for wanting

259
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
to slow the adoption of these so we

260
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
wanted to write down what these tensions

261
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,080
are so that we could also help resolve

262
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,399
them so that we can get wider adoption

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,800
that is actually the goal um and to

264
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,880
approach them and approach the the

265
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,720
resolving of these tensions from from

266
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
the public interest so they are in turn

267
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,279
the first is around internet

268
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,839
measurements um and and internet

269
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,920
research so using the dns to understand

270
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,079
even censorship ironically and many

271
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,399
other things um relied on the dns so

272
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,279
once this sort of has has become hidden

273
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,120
from maybe browser applets or other

274
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
techniques that researchers are using

275
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,279
they had to find new techniques

276
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,760
um it as i mentioned as we're going to

277
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,360
talk about more it consolidates service

278
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,079
provision so as siobhan noted you really

279
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
have to trust your resolver for some

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,279
people that means it is not their isp

281
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,240
and as our devices move with us around

282
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,880
town around the world um

283
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,360
we then are maybe fixed to the same

284
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,200
resolver

285
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,760
always even if our isps are changing so

286
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,279
there's a bit of a consolidating effect

287
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,279
there and that ins in general

288
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,120
anti-competitive and not public's best

289
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,160
interest

290
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,279
um

291
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,760
it also makes abuse mitigation harder

292
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,640
there's a lot of sort of spam malware

293
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,800
other kinds of detection that has

294
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,040
traditionally been done at the dns level

295
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,519
and so once all that data gets hidden

296
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,160
from various intermediaries that abuse

297
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,640
mitigation becomes much harder

298
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,040
and we don't want spam or malware so

299
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,600
that's again another important tension

300
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,920
keeping that keeping users safe

301
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
um

302
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,920
this one is more recent for us to

303
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
acknowledge and we were hoping we would

304
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,519
have someone on the panel to talk about

305
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,760
it more in depth so it still remains a

306
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,440
bit of a gap for us but there are a

307
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,079
variety of third-party or

308
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,200
add-on

309
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,519
sorts of tools that often act at the

310
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,600
user agent level for the purposes of

311
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,959
accessibility or usability improvements

312
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,240
that can be disrupted by this so the

313
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,399
tension between privacy respecting

314
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,519
protocols um and accessibility tools is

315
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,720
something that we would like to learn

316
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,959
more about we document it in our paper

317
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,440
but as as i mentioned we would love to

318
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
dive a bit deeper into that

319
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,800
um and then the last one that we discuss

320
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
is around internet shutdowns and

321
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,320
censorship measures in response to these

322
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,920
protocols so it's really um important

323
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,560
work to make protocols um and the

324
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,079
internet in general more privacy

325
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,480
respecting for users and privacy and

326
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,399
censorship are often two sides of the

327
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,720
same coin if you can't tell who someone

328
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,079
is or what they're looking at it's

329
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,760
harder to disrupt

330
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,480
accessing that information and so it can

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,760
provoke

332
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,320
sufficiently motivated sensors to take

333
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,120
on even more extreme measures to keep

334
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,959
information from people or to keep

335
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,480
people from information however you want

336
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,600
to

337
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
slice that and so it means that without

338
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
a sort of clear vision for how this

339
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
might you know provoke greater action or

340
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,240
put more people actually at risk of

341
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,320
having their communications interrupted

342
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,160
this can be a consequence so it's

343
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,760
important to i think discuss this and

344
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,120
confront it so we can avoid it um better

345
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,279
than we did with private dns i'm i'm

346
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,440
sure gershwin will talk about that later

347
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,399
um

348
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,360
than we did this time so with that um i

349
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,480
want to hand it back now to siobhan um

350
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,160
to go deeper into um consolidation

351
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,040
and um this particular these two

352
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,639
particular technologies around private

353
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
dns um and and how

354
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,200
we might also resolve them thanks yeah

355
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
so i think it's interesting

356
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,959
for dns but also just generally for

357
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,160
privacy

358
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,120
tech to examine how

359
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,959
much we depend on

360
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,760
consolidation for privacy benefits so as

361
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,639
an example i mentioned oblivious dough

362
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
then oblivious dough as it's deployed

363
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
today is was inspired by

364
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
academic work um and it was called

365
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,639
oblivious dns at the time and i think

366
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,279
emily stark from google pointed out that

367
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,440
it's interesting to see how much the

368
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,760
academics

369
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
bench over backwards to

370
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,959
make sure that their scheme like fit

371
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,720
like onto the existing dns

372
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,079
infrastructure because they didn't want

373
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,360
to

374
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
they thought that was the best

375
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
chance of making sure that it achieved a

376
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,839
lot of adoption

377
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,880
but then

378
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,279
um you didn't really get a lot of get

379
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,880
get a lot of adoption but two years

380
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,839
later cloudflare was like oh like

381
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,760
inspired by this idea they just

382
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,000
changed the resolve their resolver and

383
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,760
they happened to run one of the largest

384
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,519
public dns resolvers they just changed

385
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,920
it so fundamentally added a new thing to

386
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,440
the dns and suddenly um like you know

387
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,040
most of the internet can use this

388
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
privacy respecting protocol so

389
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,440
consolidation has its benefits

390
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
um

391
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
platforms are

392
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,560
extremely are can rapidly roll out um

393
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,079
privacy features

394
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,519
so

395
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,519
so that's good in a sense if you know

396
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,600
for as privacy

397
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,800
people who care about privacy that's

398
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,440
great but also this often means that one

399
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
single provider gets all the data um and

400
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,120
even if one provider doesn't get the

401
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
data um

402
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,079
it you know the trust model is kind of

403
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,279
confusing

404
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,320
and

405
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
there's like there's um the chance of

406
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
collusion uh but you know in the if

407
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,279
let's say everyone trusted their isp

408
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,839
then you would not need any of these dns

409
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,160
privacy mechanisms um or at least like

410
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,880
the

411
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,600
stuff from the client to the resolver so

412
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,079
um so you know in an ideal world

413
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:16,959
um

414
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,560
this would be a lot more distributed and

415
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,440
you wouldn't need this kind of

416
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
consolidation

417
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,320
and

418
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,959
i think duo traffic dough is kind of the

419
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,720
sharpest example of this over the last

420
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
few years mozilla got a lot of heat when

421
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,240
they

422
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,440
tried to

423
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,199
or when they were working on dns over

424
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,320
https mainly from isps

425
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,440
who

426
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,800
you know a lot of folks don't trust

427
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,600
their isps in in the us but um

428
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
like people elsewhere often do trust

429
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,279
their isps but it was kind of

430
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,040
interesting to see that the folks the

431
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,440
isps who were most against though were

432
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
exactly the ones who were also like

433
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,880
mining user data and then selling it

434
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,800
which kind of tells you something so so

435
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,160
yeah i mean all this to say that there

436
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,800
is a tension here um and

437
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,680
we

438
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
we should be aware of that tension and

439
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,279
we should really focus on

440
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,880
when we design protocols as protocol

441
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,399
designers we should try to make it so

442
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,040
that we don't de fact or just rely on

443
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,480
consolidation um as our

444
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,399
as something crucial to

445
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,839
ensuring privacy

446
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,880
and

447
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
somewhat tangentially i think it's also

448
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,800
interesting to think about ux when it

449
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,399
comes to dns um

450
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,560
so you know it would be great if we

451
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
could say that if a browser maker could

452
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
say that oh you know what a user can

453
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,160
just go and select their own dns

454
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,639
resolver and that this solves all of

455
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,720
your problems right like now you're not

456
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,440
um you're the the user is choosing an

457
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
encrypted door resolver for themselves

458
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,199
and that's fantastic

459
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,720
but except that it's extremely hard to

460
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,959
get meaningful meaningful consent when

461
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,040
it comes to something as technical and

462
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,079
down in the weeds as dns um but i think

463
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,800
it's

464
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
it is kind of an unexplored

465
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,399
area of research like no one's really

466
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
done too many studies on this

467
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,759
so i think it'd be good to see if there

468
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,480
is some kind of metaphor that we can use

469
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,559
um or there's some user education that

470
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,400
we can do um

471
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,280
if you know to make this dns choice more

472
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,039
meaningful or we can just conclude that

473
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,720
this is impossible and give up and we

474
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,119
can all move on

475
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,240
so um because yeah because then i i

476
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,919
think another aspect of this is like no

477
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,240
one's also done too many studies about

478
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,199
um

479
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,799
you know what is like

480
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,880
if there's latency in dns like what is

481
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,520
the actual perceived um

482
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,039
delay for a user when it comes to

483
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,280
loading a website if it turns out that

484
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,000
dns is not the blocking piece

485
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,640
in a user's website experience then you

486
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,919
know we can use something even more

487
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,120
private and

488
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,720
less consolidated like dns over tor

489
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,559
which will have performance benefits but

490
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,360
um

491
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,840
is i think kind of like gets us both the

492
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,679
privacy benefit and the

493
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
decentralization benefit

494
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
um yeah so to conclude i guess there are

495
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,679
various advantages to consolidated

496
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,880
approaches but

497
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
we should really like think quite hard

498
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,320
about when we're developing these

499
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,439
protocols in the first place

500
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,840
yeah thanks a lot for

501
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,679
that presentation siobhan and i have

502
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,039
already queued up a couple questions

503
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,200
that i'm going to wait to ask you until

504
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,640
christian presents this piece so

505
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,120
gershoba i'm so glad you've joined us um

506
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,799
thanks for waiting to um to talk and if

507
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,080
you wouldn't mind just introducing

508
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,919
yourself first before you jump into

509
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,360
talking about how

510
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,080
this um creates some tension with the

511
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,640
need to uh keep the internet free from

512
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,880
censorship

513
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,919
thank you so much um yeah i'm gurshaved

514
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,520
grover i'm joining from bangalore india

515
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,600
where it's about 3 30 am so i hope you

516
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,960
will forgive me for any lapse in

517
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,080
coherence

518
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,960
um

519
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,360
i am currently an uh information

520
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,280
controls fellow supported by the open

521
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,039
tech fund i'm studying online censorship

522
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,120
specifically the legal and technical

523
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,440
architecture of censorship in currently

524
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,600
in india and pakistan

525
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
in in the past few years i've

526
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,840
i've also been an active participant at

527
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,919
the internet engineering task force and

528
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
the internet research task force

529
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
um advocating for more security and

530
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,960
privacy in in network standards

531
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,440
and uh yeah it's a it's a pleasure to be

532
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,559
here thank you so much for having me

533
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,679
uh on

534
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,640
um on on dns privacy and and censorship

535
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,039
i think uh as as as both of you have

536
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,200
already sort of uh said

537
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,840
plaintext dns queries are available to

538
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,559
the internet service provider isp even

539
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,520
if you're not using your isps dns server

540
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,000
the isp can have like middle boxes that

541
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
can keep track of these plain text

542
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,960
queries so

543
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,840
this information has been uh you know i

544
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,640
mean

545
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
across the globe like tracked by isps

546
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,799
and in some cases also

547
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,480
like user traffic patterns have been

548
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,960
sold by them for monetary profit so

549
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,120
the the link to

550
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,520
the government is also important using

551
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,440
information access and surveillance laws

552
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,200
your government has access to this

553
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,640
information and

554
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,799
though so directly or indirectly

555
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,120
governments can see a list of websites

556
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,159
or

557
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,760
web services that you have used or

558
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,039
visited

559
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,039
and um generally private dns at least

560
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,039
historically at the itf

561
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,919
um

562
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,000
the conversations also are centered

563
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
around this loss of privacy which is

564
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,440
great and the

565
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,039
direct link that

566
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,960
mallory you just mentioned is the fact

567
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,760
that

568
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,799
plaintext dnx dns queries then have not

569
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,799
been just a matter of privacy loss but

570
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,440
also directly affecting the right to

571
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,600
freedom of expression and the right to

572
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,679
access information for people in many

573
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,880
countries

574
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,640
generally anything visible to the isp

575
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
can also be used by the isp to stop

576
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,080
connections to it right and so

577
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,720
isps and state control infrastructure in

578
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,640
many countries have censored information

579
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,360
based on dns by tampering the response

580
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
so what should we expect

581
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
from

582
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,360
these countries when there is widespread

583
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,840
deployment of private dns protocols like

584
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
dot and doh

585
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
i think first is the tendency to block

586
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,000
the use of the protocol itself and um

587
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
this

588
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
tendency applies particularly to

589
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
countries which don't just block

590
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
specific content but are also keen on

591
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,720
blocking

592
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
privacy preserving technology or

593
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,840
censorship circumvention tools and um as

594
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,919
siobhan said dot works on a specific

595
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,880
port number so it's rather easy to block

596
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,000
um

597
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,120
and

598
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
in fact some

599
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,080
criticism of though was also that

600
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
it it might be actually easy to

601
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,640
fingerprint

602
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,360
um https connections that are carrying

603
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,200
the query so that may be possible we

604
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
haven't seen

605
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,880
uh particular evidence of that dot

606
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,600
blocking we've already seen um

607
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,960
uh there's a paper by uh simone basso

608
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,679
that sort of studies dot and does

609
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,320
blocking in iran and china particularly

610
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,840
where we've seen um

611
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,799
both uh so yeah the second tendency i

612
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,280
wanted to describe was blocking specific

613
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,080
endpoints so eve even when it comes to

614
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,000
doh

615
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
let's say you're using cloudflares or

616
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
google's

617
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,919
dot server the endpoint is still the

618
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,520
same and there are still privacy holes

619
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,280
in other protocols like https where uh

620
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,200
using the server name indication you can

621
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
you know block the endpoint specifically

622
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,200
even if you're not blocking blocking the

623
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,799
protocol itself

624
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,080
um

625
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,159
and again so both of these tendencies

626
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,880
we've already seen uh evidence that you

627
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,080
know the

628
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
censorship is happening at these levels

629
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,520
um

630
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,799
one

631
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,760
uh

632
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,159
uh and and uh mallory you mentioned the

633
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,400
part about you know dns privacy versus

634
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,919
internet shutdowns

635
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,200
uh

636
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,840
so so this line of thinking that when

637
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,880
um when there is an advance in privacy

638
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,679
certain countries or certain governments

639
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:14,799
might

640
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,760
take disproportionate steps right and um

641
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,640
this

642
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,039
i i think even in their calculation

643
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,600
there is attention and negative press

644
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,679
attracted if you take draconian steps

645
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,440
like internet shutdown so

646
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,320
um and i i don't know if there's like

647
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,480
a theoretical framework to say that it

648
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,520
will lean in

649
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,600
that direction but some instances

650
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,000
clearly indicate that so i i think it's

651
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
very worth exploring um

652
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,880
specifically if you look at the history

653
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,440
of lexis online censorship in general as

654
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,240
we saw more https deployment what it

655
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,559
meant is rather than the government

656
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,480
telling the isp to block

657
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,720
facebook.com

658
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,279
something they contacted facebook

659
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,799
directly and asked them to block it

660
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,080
right um even though isps are more

661
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,840
willing to comply with local law because

662
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
they're usually operating with licenses

663
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,159
and more stringent regulation

664
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,960
and in this case uh we haven't seen this

665
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,120
yet but there's no reason the government

666
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,799
cannot go to a private dns server

667
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,799
you know whether it's operating on dot

668
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,200
or doh and say tamper your response for

669
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
this country right and uh

670
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,919
this is actually easy

671
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:26,799
i mean

672
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,559
if you're in touch with that company

673
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,200
it's rather an easy request to make

674
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
which i think we will also see more of

675
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,720
now that private dns deployment is

676
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,000
increasing

677
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,960
um

678
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,320
so yeah uh

679
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,679
and and yeah

680
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,640
i think later we can also explore but

681
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,520
like

682
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,840
the trends of weather we can expect even

683
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,120
more um

684
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,279
sort of draconian responses

685
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,360
thank you

686
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,520
great so yeah so this should give um

687
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,200
folks an idea of

688
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
uh the kinds of ways we

689
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,799
approach this problem

690
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,400
actually leaning into the fact that

691
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,600
there's attention there and trying to

692
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,440
figure out how to resolve it so i know

693
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,880
that we haven't necessarily offered a

694
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,720
lot of ways to resolve it but one of the

695
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,559
first steps i think often is just

696
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,039
acknowledging that there is a real

697
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,159
problem um rather than trying to gloss

698
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,480
over it so gerschabot i want to start my

699
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
my own questions with you and then i do

700
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,080
promise to stop 10 minutes before we're

701
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,600
done so the audience can ask questions

702
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,960
but with um what like the example that

703
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,559
sticks out to me with um respect to how

704
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,400
protocol developers maybe were thinking

705
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,600
about this particular case in advance

706
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,279
was server name indication encryption so

707
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,480
in https in the handshake even for

708
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,400
encrypted http right there is a plain

709
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,039
text request for the server name

710
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,400
indicator that is often the same data in

711
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,360
dns so if you're not hiding that then

712
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,600
you know is it really working um but

713
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
then the problem with encrypting that

714
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,279
um

715
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,360
seemed like it might not go well and and

716
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,679
it is indeed what we found we saw

717
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,760
sensors um

718
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
going ahead and blocking

719
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,440
um tls 1.3 that had the encrypted

720
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
um sni extension can you just talk a

721
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,600
little bit about why

722
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,720
that happened or like you know how um

723
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,840
how you feel like it might have been

724
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,159
done better

725
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,840
yeah

726
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,559
for

727
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,760
tls and encrypted sni and now encrypted

728
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,440
client hello i think

729
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,320
um

730
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,520
i would say

731
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,760
it was almost expected like both

732
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,200
problems were called out the first

733
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,159
problem being do not stick out which was

734
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,600
how how do we make this uh

735
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,400
privacy extension

736
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
not appear not any different from

737
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
previous traffic right so that it cannot

738
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,520
be censored separately and this part of

739
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,200
the problem when it came to encrypted

740
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,840
sni hadn't been figured out and

741
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,799
then uh there was evidence that um

742
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,440
from china that

743
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,559
any uh any tls traffic that was using an

744
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,400
encrypted snipe was dropped because the

745
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,360
do not stick out problem was not solved

746
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,120
the second thing i think it relates to

747
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,640
is

748
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,679
what

749
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,960
becomes infeasible for a sensor to block

750
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
right and that

751
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,760
that's a problem about critical mass if

752
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,919
uh so for example tls

753
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,320
1.3 i think it was so quickly deployed

754
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,919
even though there were so many advances

755
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,320
from tls 1.2 not many countries actually

756
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,720
ended up blocking tls 1.3 the protocol

757
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,799
itself because there was such a rapid

758
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,240
shift there was such

759
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,640
consensus and momentum that it was

760
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,679
impossible for encrypted s we saw that

761
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,440
there was only one company i think at

762
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,760
that time that had actively posted and

763
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,279
there were reports that it was blocked

764
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,520
right so i think both the design

765
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,480
problems and i i i'm not saying that's

766
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,840
easy to do either of them which is

767
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,279
uh do not stick out if you're just

768
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,760
making an extension and the second like

769
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,520
how do you achieve critical mass so

770
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
quickly that it becomes infeasible for a

771
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,880
sensor to block that traffic

772
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,120
yeah perfect and too big to block is

773
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,520
something that we call out in the

774
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
um in the consolidation section that

775
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,840
siobhan has talked about is like

776
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,120
you know maybe it's one of one of the

777
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,279
things where you know it's like at least

778
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,440
at least you can you know you have the

779
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,720
power to to do something good so um my

780
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,480
next question is exactly on the same

781
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
point but for siobhan so

782
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,159
um the

783
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,240
the rollout question that gershwin just

784
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,399
talked about before um do and dot

785
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,799
it was a little um

786
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,880
i think i found it really interesting to

787
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,960
watch the discussion coming from isps in

788
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,039
particular who were very reticent

789
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,480
pushing back against this and then of

790
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,320
course actually the solution is that

791
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,559
they all just ended up adopting it too

792
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,399
and started resolving

793
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,360
um queries using do

794
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,440
and i and i think it was something maybe

795
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,120
you didn't quite call out or mention in

796
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,039
your intervention but we do discuss in

797
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,240
paper about the difference between um

798
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,120
using trusted resolvers which is how um

799
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
i think firefox does it with their trust

800
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,360
resolver program and then the way other

801
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,840
browsers might do it with opportunistic

802
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,720
um dough lookups meaning you know if

803
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,520
you're

804
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,200
um and maybe you can just go ahead and

805
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,799
explain i won't explain it but i want i

806
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,679
want my question around that is um what

807
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,640
are some

808
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,200
i think ways that we can try to tackle

809
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
this rollout question both to address

810
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,440
like gershabad's position but then also

811
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,840
like you know the

812
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,919
pluralism um and trying to defeat then

813
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,159
the um consolidation

814
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,520
issue

815
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,360
yeah i think um so yeah like you said

816
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,760
mozilla had a trusted resolver program

817
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,480
um and the idea was that um as long as

818
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,039
an isp um offered to

819
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,159
provide an encrypted dns service

820
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,440
and agreed to comply with um a bunch of

821
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,960
um regular like

822
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,480
principles like you know we won't store

823
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
the data beyond 24 hours

824
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,559
we will not use it we will not sell that

825
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,679
data

826
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,480
so on and so forth um

827
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,960
mozilla said that we would include

828
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,919
them as one of the available options um

829
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,360
for for a user

830
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,440
and would also i think i don't remember

831
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,159
this exactly but i think would also

832
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,200
like do a

833
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
first try to

834
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,120
first check the local isp to see if they

835
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,520
have a service and then if that service

836
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,120
also was part of the trusted resolver

837
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,640
program then would use that um

838
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,840
like that that uh dns resolver um which

839
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,120
you know is is

840
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,360
i think it's a cool idea and um i think

841
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,279
that's actually in production and

842
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,720
um it's

843
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,399
like i think the other some of the other

844
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,919
browsers are took a more opportunistic

845
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,159
view of this so like if you try on a

846
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,320
local level and if that doesn't succeed

847
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,440
then you

848
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
um

849
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,919
then you kind of

850
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,960
use the

851
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,559
the google

852
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,640
dns over https resolver so

853
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,679
i guess those are the two differences

854
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,360
like do you nail down and you say like

855
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,559
okay these are the things you have to

856
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,720
comply with before you are allowed to

857
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,679
become

858
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,200
um an accepted dns resolver or do you um

859
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
just check the local network see if

860
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,679
something exists and then

861
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,559
then

862
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,279
you roll it out so yeah i guess those

863
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,320
are the different kind of approaches

864
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,039
that browser winners took

865
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,440
grave is also

866
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,200
considering like different experiments

867
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,279
but we have to be careful about

868
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,640
like rolling it out by default i think

869
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,799
that is the question that is extremely

870
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,679
um

871
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,240
like hard to tackle on is how to tackle

872
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,440
because like where do you roll this out

873
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,279
by default um and for what regions and

874
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,240
um so on and so forth so i think and

875
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,320
when you do roll it out like do you risk

876
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,240
breaking a bunch of um websites and

877
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,360
stuff so

878
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,120
um so there's a question of like running

879
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,919
experiments and stuff and um yeah so i

880
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:58,720
think

881
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,840
those are kind of like all the different

882
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,519
approaches that browser makers have

883
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,840
taken

884
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,679
yeah and it really matters i mean it

885
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,679
isn't just about the protocol

886
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,080
it's about the implementation i found

887
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,240
almost most i would say most of the

888
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,799
discussion we've been having is you know

889
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,399
not related to the design of the

890
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,519
protocol but but it's been a really

891
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,120
useful example

892
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,360
and so i now um

893
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,679
right on the dot 10 minutes left want to

894
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,399
open it for questions i'm moderating but

895
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,559
i'm not also able to see i think the

896
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,799
room if there's a mic cue or however

897
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,640
that's handled so siobhan i might ask

898
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,480
for your help a little bit if there are

899
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,559
questions um and how to

900
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,360
so i can help out here

901
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,039
we have requested everyone to post

902
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,720
questions on the slack channel so you

903
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,799
won't see folks on the room asking

904
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,080
questions

905
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
but the intention of this panel was to

906
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,559
get people talking and discussing and

907
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,159
you achieved that and there are a lot of

908
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,760
questions on the dns panel so please

909
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,880
take a look

910
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
there and you could answer many of them

911
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
i'll take a few the first one is from

912
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,519
leah so can you talk about why folks

913
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,679
other than enterprises are blocking

914
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,799
encrypted dns in practice in a corporate

915
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,919
setting uh leah suspects that it might

916
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
be blocked so that the security team can

917
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,480
try to track command and control traffic

918
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,840
from malware

919
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
there might be other motivations in some

920
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,120
organizations but the security people

921
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,519
they know tend to think about that as a

922
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,480
primary trade-off

923
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,159
um

924
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:32,880
yeah

925
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,039
happy if anybody wants to jump in i mean

926
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,440
that was this sort of goes to the other

927
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,760
piece about you know in the end isps

928
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,240
just ended up adopting it and resolving

929
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,120
dough a lot of the intermediaries

930
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,320
including enterprise solutions also can

931
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,039
resolve dog queries they essentially

932
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,799
receive it just as siobhan is saying

933
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,320
opportunistically

934
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,720
first um at the local and because it's

935
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,519
dns lookup is hierarchical um if you're

936
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,840
if you yourself are offering dough then

937
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,799
you will receive those requests and you

938
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,679
can

939
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,519
as an enterprise then

940
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,119
do your filtering and blocking as you

941
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,440
wish so that is actually one

942
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,320
um solution is just to

943
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,239
adopt this newer protocol

944
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,918
do others have responses

945
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,159
um yeah i mean so one use case that i've

946
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,040
heard is just from people like software

947
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,760
makers who make um like child protection

948
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,918
software so if you're running often i

949
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,440
think you run this on your local router

950
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,719
and parents want to make sure that

951
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,480
their children are not talking to anyone

952
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,159
that they don't approve of so that's

953
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,719
where i think those makers of that

954
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,119
software often don't like the fact that

955
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,359
um now they can't see the dns queries at

956
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,000
all so that's another um

957
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,719
i guess use case and uh but yeah i think

958
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,560
the primary one that i've heard as well

959
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,879
is like a security versus privacy

960
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,239
trade-off you're trying to identify

961
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,000
malware and now you can't do that

962
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,440
anymore

963
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,920
and jeffrey also adds to this point that

964
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,320
they have seen organization play games

965
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,000
with subverting tls in the name of

966
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,599
security

967
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,760
they have a legitimate case for wanting

968
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,320
to know what goes on goes into and out

969
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,240
of their network but security trade-offs

970
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,480
for subverting security mechanisms are

971
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,480
enormous

972
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,960
yeah i mean this goes back to t like tls

973
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,040
and which um

974
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
would would not be standardized in the

975
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,480
ietf as enterprise tls as the ability to

976
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,119
sort of interrupt a secure tls

977
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,720
connection but it did get standardized

978
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,240
in the european

979
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,040
um standards body etsy um

980
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,119
and then had to change its name because

981
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,359
the ietf threatened to sue them for

982
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,200
calling it etls

983
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,800
but yeah i mean this is a classic

984
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,079
problem there's always going to be

985
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,200
attention um sort of ex if you're a

986
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,160
parent

987
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,599
or a boss

988
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,640
you may

989
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,079
want to

990
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:54,960
um

991
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
attack like be essentially like the

992
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
attacker you know

993
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,599
right is um certainly an architecture

994
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,280
that we deal with a lot and for some

995
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,599
that also then means government would be

996
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,079
um an acceptable attacker you know but

997
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,760
just certainly not for everyone so we're

998
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,440
trying to think about core internet

999
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,760
infrastructures versus you know sort of

1000
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,760
local realities um and i guess there's a

1001
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,800
pluralistic view there um

1002
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,520
but there's obviously balance

1003
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,200
and there's this other comment on this

1004
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,079
topic by joshua that government agencies

1005
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,400
might also have the same interest

1006
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,760
and also education filtering blocking

1007
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,440
technologies

1008
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
that company use

1009
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
sorry let me read that again

1010
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,960
joshua wouldn't be surprised if

1011
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
companies that provide educational

1012
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
filtering blocking technologies block

1013
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,160
encrypted dns too

1014
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
so the next

1015
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,560
question

1016
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,960
here

1017
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,880
is um

1018
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,280
is someone maintaining a list of isps

1019
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,320
with respect to dot blocking

1020
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,280
dot blocking

1021
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,160
it's a good question i know there's an

1022
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,480
opposite the opposite answer

1023
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,320
to the question you didn't ask is

1024
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,040
there's a group of isps um that

1025
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,200
participate in a group around

1026
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,480
encrypted

1027
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,800
um the encrypted network so there are a

1028
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,560
bunch of the large providers you would

1029
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,520
imagine

1030
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,160
um on both sides of the atlantic i don't

1031
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,440
recall if there are isps

1032
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,200
from latin america asia or africa that

1033
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,560
participate in this group but

1034
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,000
essentially yeah there are sort of cross

1035
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,079
company learning group that are actually

1036
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,040
trying to adopt as best they can

1037
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,200
encrypted technology so that

1038
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,599
many of them can maintain their own

1039
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,599
surveillance filtering and so on and so

1040
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,520
forth but i mean

1041
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,680
at the end of the day these are sort of

1042
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,800
marketing products um there are uh there

1043
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
are now alternatives for users if they

1044
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,280
don't trust their isp but i think it's a

1045
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,440
positive step um that there are some

1046
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,200
isps out there that are explicitly

1047
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,680
trying to do the right thing

1048
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,839
and hold on to their business model

1049
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,599
which their users may or may not know

1050
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,280
about or agree with um

1051
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,960
but yeah i think there must i mean maybe

1052
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,480
gersh about this question is really for

1053
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,440
you in terms of um being able to track

1054
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,960
and document um known sensors

1055
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,359
and throughout the world and how they're

1056
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,240
censoring things

1057
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,440
yeah i i mean

1058
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,240
all isps in a like in a country like

1059
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,320
india will be censoring certain traffic

1060
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,760
because they're obligated by the

1061
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,079
government to do so and i mean this is

1062
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,880
true for many countries i think

1063
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,560
um

1064
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,880
there was pushback against dns like

1065
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
private dns protocols by certain

1066
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,560
internet service providers and there

1067
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,359
will you know like i feel

1068
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,400
that the

1069
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,520
second set of conversations that uh

1070
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,040
are part of which siobhan was also

1071
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,960
describing about like discovering

1072
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,119
equivalent encrypted resolvers in your

1073
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,359
own network is is almost like a

1074
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,560
isp saying how do we sort of reconcile

1075
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,240
with this reality that

1076
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,200
duo and dot are like

1077
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,760
i mean deployed now uh

1078
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,200
i i would say

1079
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,040
uh from the censorship angle you might

1080
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,200
be happy about right like you can say oh

1081
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,760
i'm no longer actually providing dna

1082
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,440
services so i no longer have to censor

1083
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,760
them i might have other censorship

1084
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,560
infrastructure in place um

1085
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,000
yeah the

1086
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,760
uh the the uh

1087
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,599
the thing i said earlier about now

1088
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,760
private dna servers receiving censorship

1089
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
requests i think

1090
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,839
uh

1091
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,079
this uh i mean uh again this is a

1092
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,240
prediction so but i think this will

1093
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,720
happen sooner or later and

1094
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,359
uh after like a list of sensorius like

1095
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,760
isps which we now have

1096
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,680
because of like measurement databases

1097
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,720
like only etc we would also need like

1098
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,640
information about what

1099
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,119
dns servers like and i specifically mean

1100
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,960
third party which are not affiliated to

1101
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,240
any isp

1102
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,640
are censoring traffic right and in which

1103
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,040
country if you're a server you can local

1104
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,960
like you can sort of

1105
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,359
geographically scope your censorship and

1106
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,280
we will need like another

1107
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,800
tracking mechanism for that

1108
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,880
nicole is wondering uh in the oblivious

1109
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,560
dns over https https who would own or

1110
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,200
control the proxy service the same org

1111
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,440
running the resolver

1112
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,119
um so it's

1113
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,359
supposed to be a different

1114
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,359
organization

1115
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,960
and it is actually pretty crucial that

1116
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,319
the proxy is a different organization

1117
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,599
otherwise the whole thing kind of

1118
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,280
collapses

1119
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
because the whole

1120
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,000
privacy

1121
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,520
benefit here is that you're not trusting

1122
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,200
any one entity you now um i guess are

1123
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,599
trusting two entities but you are yeah

1124
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,839
you can kind of rely on the fact that

1125
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,319
uh not one party can see everything um

1126
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,880
so um so yeah so as long as

1127
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,440
those two organizations don't collude

1128
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,880
your privacy is maintained

1129
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,200
what's the biggest hurdle invited option

1130
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,400
of doh or dot um this question is by

1131
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,480
barros and he's wondering do operating

1132
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,280
system browsers have a role to play to

1133
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,040
set default dns resolvers

1134
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,240
yeah this was one um risk that we

1135
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,079
probably don't treat enough in our paper

1136
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,720
as such which is that once all

1137
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,960
applications out there start setting

1138
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,280
their own dns resolvers it gets a little

1139
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,040
bit messy

1140
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,200
and probably the best

1141
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,880
sort of and this is why we also try to

1142
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,720
make a determination

1143
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,960
in certain of these

1144
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,640
cases of tensions

1145
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,400
between do

1146
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,079
dot

1147
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,040
encrypted s and i etc etc because

1148
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,920
the

1149
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,000
the solutions are different um the

1150
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,240
technologies are different but um in

1151
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,240
general it seems that you know using um

1152
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,440
dot for example so dns over tls at the

1153
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,200
operating system level

1154
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,000
would maybe give users the most control

1155
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,480
and leverage over all of you know their

1156
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,400
entire environment you only have to set

1157
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,119
that once

1158
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,640
and so if you have a strong trust

1159
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,079
relationship with a resolver that might

1160
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,280
be your best bet but then that doesn't

1161
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,119
mean that other applications couldn't

1162
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,920
override that essentially and do dns

1163
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,839
queries differently

1164
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,040
so it is

1165
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,680
it is a thorny issue it's a very keen

1166
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,640
question

1167
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,520
um and and i don't know other than

1168
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,599
trying our best to sort of prescribe

1169
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,920
best practice and implementation of

1170
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,119
these things um exactly how to

1171
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,640
resolve it or fix it

1172
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,160
so web host

1173
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,200
so web shared

1174
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,160
document sorry whom am i speaking over

1175
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,119
please go ahead no no please go ahead

1176
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,880
uh i was going to move to the next topic

1177
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,200
that has been a lot of discussion

1178
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,560
and this is a document that webher

1179
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,160
shared about

1180
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,359
comcast

1181
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,280
certainly does not sell dns data

1182
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,680
and so please take a look at it

1183
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,000
and there are a bunch of questions and

1184
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,920
discussions about it

1185
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,720
which need a lot of context so moving to

1186
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,359
the next one is from us

1187
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,240
it

1188
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,560
how do services like icloud private

1189
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,880
relay impact the discussion around dns

1190
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,520
privacy you for icloud privately really

1191
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,119
i'm from apple and so this is one of my

1192
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,119
teams

1193
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,400
[Laughter]

1194
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,560
well i would let you take a go but yeah

1195
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,720
this icloud private relay basically

1196
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,520
protects your ip address and obfuscates

1197
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,839
your dns entry before it goes to an

1198
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,040
external resolver

1199
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,560
and so there's more details in the

1200
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,960
document but how would that affect your

1201
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,440
analysis of torque and having a secure

1202
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,599
dns or a secure and private dns

1203
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,560
so um sorry so apple does the

1204
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,400
private relay does use oblivious dough

1205
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,200
right

1206
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,640
yeah so

1207
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,240
um i think

1208
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,839
i guess yeah like i mentioned i think

1209
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,760
this is um

1210
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,160
it was developed specifically for

1211
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,040
for

1212
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,480
against the idea that you would have to

1213
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,160
trust one resolver with all your data so

1214
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,520
i think it's a

1215
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,319
step in the right direction um it's just

1216
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,720
that um yeah you know like what proxy

1217
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,960
you use and who do you trust then

1218
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,119
um i think is very interesting and kind

1219
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,040
of unexplored like what that means for

1220
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,000
user choice and user consent because

1221
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,040
you know

1222
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,119
if i use a browser let's say

1223
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,640
maybe you could argue that you know i

1224
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,800
have consented to using the browser and

1225
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,319
i have a trust relationship with that

1226
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,000
browser

1227
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,079
but if my browser then uses something

1228
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,240
else on the back end like that

1229
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,720
and not and then like not only do they

1230
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,560
use a different backend but they use two

1231
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,440
different

1232
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,640
servers that this is just getting

1233
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,280
extremely complicated now so um so i

1234
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,319
think that's what i would say to that

1235
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,079
yeah i think there's also further more

1236
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,560
instruction interesting discussions on

1237
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,800
doh over tor

1238
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,520
and lot more other interesting it's

1239
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,280
still going on

1240
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,359
so please take a look at the slack

1241
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,800
channel

1242
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,480
and someone said that they need a

1243
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,200
t-shirt called dns is not dead i

1244
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,319
completely support it

1245
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,640
so yeah we are at the end of this

1246
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,560
session thank you so much for this

1247
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,990
wonderful panel

1248
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:40,450
[Applause]
