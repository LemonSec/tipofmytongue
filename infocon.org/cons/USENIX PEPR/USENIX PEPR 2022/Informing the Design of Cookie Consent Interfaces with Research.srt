1
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,240
hello my name is laurie crainer welcome

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,119
to my kitchen today i would like to talk

3
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,320
with you about cookies

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,640
no not these yummy chocolate chip

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
cookies that just came out of my oven

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,640
today we're going to talk about those

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,480
cookies that can do useful things on

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,880
websites but can also invade your

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,280
privacy you know the ones i'm talking

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,920
about you can't see those cookies but

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,399
you've undoubtedly seen those annoying

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,120
cookie consent banners popping up all

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,559
over the place

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,640
do you ever read them

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,079
most people don't

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,399
they are supposed to offer users privacy

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,440
choices and comply with privacy laws but

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
many of them fail to do either of these

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,120
things

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,719
how can we make cookie consent

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,360
interfaces more usable that's a question

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
that i've been studying with my

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
colleagues and students in scilab at

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,000
carnegie mellon university so today i

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,760
would like to talk about some of our

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,080
research in this area and some of our

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
recommendations for better cookie

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,759
consent design

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
so let's start by looking at what we

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,560
mean by the word usable what makes a

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,960
cookie consent interface or really any

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,119
privacy choice or consent interface

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,240
usable

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,320
we've identified seven important

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
properties

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
first the interface needs to address

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,960
user needs it needs to offer a set of

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
choices that include options that users

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,920
actually want if we offer a choice of

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,000
peanut butter cookies or almond cookies

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,399
to people who have allergic reactions to

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,040
nuts we aren't meeting user needs

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,439
similarly if our users don't want

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,680
website cookies then forcing them to

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,759
accept all cookies whether they like it

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,799
or not is not meeting their needs

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,200
second the interface should require

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,840
minimal effort to use it should be easy

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,239
for users to find the choice options and

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,479
select them for cookie consent

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,120
interfaces the interface itself tends to

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,920
be easy to find as they pop up and block

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,879
your web browser but sometimes if you

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,720
want to make a choice other than

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
accepting all cookies you have to click

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
through multiple tabs to reject each

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,160
type of cookie one at a time

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,480
third users need to be aware of what

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
choices exist and where to find them

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,800
unfortunately there are a lot of

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,519
websites that offer opt-out privacy

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,840
choices but most users don't even

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,480
realize they are there even users who

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
look for these choices often have

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
trouble finding them

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
sometimes it is helpful to link to the

67
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
choices from multiple places so that

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
users will be aware of them and find

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120
them wherever they look for them whether

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,440
in the privacy policy or on the forum

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,840
where data is collected

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,720
fourth interfaces need to convey choices

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
and their implications so users

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
understand them easily

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,879
this means avoiding jargon and

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,440
convoluted sentences and making sure you

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,879
explain things so users will understand

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,440
fifth users should feel satisfied when

79
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,680
they use the interface and trust that

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,920
their choices will be honored consent

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
interfaces that just make users grumpy

82
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,239
or angry are not so good

83
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,640
six we need consent interfaces that

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,440
allow users to change their decisions

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,519
whether because they made a mistake and

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,760
click the wrong button or maybe they

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
just changed their mind

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,799
and finally we need consent interfaces

89
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,200
that don't nudge people towards the less

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,680
privacy protective options sometimes

91
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,400
referred to as dark patterns

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
let's look at some of the most common

93
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
dark patterns we see in cookie banners

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,280
all of which make me very grumpy

95
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
here we have unequal paths that is

96
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
making it easier to make the less

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,560
privacy protective choice if you want to

98
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
accept all cookies you click the big

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,959
button if you want to do something else

100
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,360
you have to click a cookie settings link

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
and then hope that when you get to the

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,440
next page you don't have to press too

103
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,000
many buttons to reject cookies this one

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,520
is very common on us websites

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,560
another common dark pattern we see is a

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,880
banner where the default setting is the

107
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,280
least privacy protective option

108
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,440
here the default setting is to accept

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
all three types of cookies required

110
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,720
functional and advertising

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
in this common dark pattern we have

112
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
confusing buttons that aren't clear

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
about what they do

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,720
in the top right corner there is an x

115
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,960
that will close the banner but which

116
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,520
cookie settings you get if you click it

117
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,759
in the bottom left is a save settings

118
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,320
button but the only choice we can see on

119
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
the screen is the choice for targeting

120
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
cookies if we want to know what the

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
choices are for the four other types of

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,639
cookies we have to click through the

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,280
four other tabs one at a time

124
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,440
then there's the ok button which might

125
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,000
do the same thing as save settings or

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,320
maybe it really means accept all i don't

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
even know

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,039
another thing we see a lot is a website

129
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,800
that has a cookie banner that doesn't

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,199
provide any choices at all you just

131
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,320
click ok or accept or got it or i'm fine

132
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
with this but you don't have any choice

133
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,720
in the manner actually i'm not fine with

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
this i'm not a lawyer but from what i

135
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,600
know about privacy law there is no good

136
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,680
reason for this sort of banner to exist

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,199
at all

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,919
finally let's look at an example of

139
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,960
confirm shaming which is wording that

140
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,680
gilts or shames users to influence their

141
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
decision

142
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
this banner talks about the quality

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,199
organic cookies that this company sells

144
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,960
which sounds great and i would love to

145
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
eat some

146
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
but that has nothing to do with whether

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
i consent to this website's use of

148
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,880
cookies

149
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,000
unfortunately there are a lot of

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,720
examples of unusable cookie banners out

151
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,919
there there's an organization in austria

152
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,600
called noi or noib which stands for none

153
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
of your business that has been searching

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
for cookie banners that are not only

155
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,199
unusable but also violate gdpr

156
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,880
they've been reaching out to hundreds of

157
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,800
companies to ask them to bring their

158
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
banners into compliance they've actually

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,759
had some success in getting websites to

160
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,680
improve their banners

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
for example you can see on this clothing

162
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
retailer's website they used to have a

163
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
big accept all cookies button and a link

164
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,199
to manage settings but now they offer

165
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
both a reject all and accept all cookies

166
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,160
button in addition to a cookie settings

167
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,800
button

168
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
noid has focused their efforts on

169
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
websites that use a consent management

170
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,080
platform or cmp from a company called

171
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,160
onetrust which seems to be the most

172
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,199
popular cmp these days there are several

173
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,080
other cmps that also have a fairly large

174
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,880
presence they all provide tools to allow

175
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,039
websites to provide consent banners and

176
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,880
control the placement of cookies

177
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,280
according to the choices users make

178
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
most of them also include tools that

179
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,680
will find all the cookies on a website

180
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,639
and put them into categories most cmps

181
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,360
offer a lot of flexibility but maybe too

182
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,240
much

183
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
you can use these tools to create

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,919
consent banners that exhibit dark

185
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,080
patterns and fail to comply with the

186
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
very regulations that are prompting

187
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,479
organizations to create consent banners

188
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
in the first place

189
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
here are two consent banners from one

190
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,639
trust the organization on the left

191
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
created this confusing interface with

192
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,879
buttons i don't understand and lots of

193
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,400
tabs to click through

194
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,479
the organization on the right has

195
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,360
toggles for all of their keys up front

196
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,840
and uses an accordion feature where you

197
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
can click on the plus sign to get more

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,199
information about each type of cookie

199
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
here is a banner from a different cmp

200
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
called cookiebot they offer a nice

201
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
checkbox format where you can see all

202
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,599
the cookie options in the banner and

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,520
check the boxes for the cookies you want

204
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
to accept

205
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,720
if you click show details you can

206
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
actually get information about each

207
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,199
cookie individually this may be more

208
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,520
than most people actually want but it is

209
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,080
an interesting option

210
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
last summer my students looked at cookie

211
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
banners on 191 websites that used one of

212
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,080
five popular cmps

213
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,919
they checked them all for five dark

214
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,399
patterns i mentioned and also looked for

215
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
other usability issues of the 191

216
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,719
websites they looked at only 23 did not

217
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,320
exhibit any dark patterns 150 of them

218
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
suffered from unequal paths

219
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,600
which was by far the most common dark

220
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,560
pattern

221
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,800
here are several examples

222
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
the other four dark patterns also showed

223
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,680
up a number of times as well

224
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
after reviewing all of these consent

225
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
banners my students realized that there

226
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
were a number of design parameters that

227
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,399
were showing up over and over again

228
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,399
probably due to the settings available

229
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,680
from the cmps we identified nine design

230
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,160
parameters and designed an online user

231
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,640
study to explore the impact of seven of

232
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,519
them

233
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,880
we presented this study at the kai 2022

234
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,959
conference in may

235
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,360
we began our research by designing an

236
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160
ecommerce website called cups and such a

237
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,040
purveyor of fine cups from stemware to

238
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,760
adult sippy cups we developed 12

239
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,839
versions of a consent banner for cups

240
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,000
and such to gain insights into the

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,279
impact of the various design parameters

242
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
this is the version that we hypothesize

243
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,680
would be the best one that we tested so

244
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,000
we called it best practices

245
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,560
it uses bulleted text rather than a big

246
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,959
dense paragraph all of the options are

247
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,839
available with nice check boxes and is

248
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,959
just as easy to accept as reject cookies

249
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,880
this banner pops up in the center of the

250
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,279
screen and requires users to make a

251
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
decision

252
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,519
this is the version that we hypothesized

253
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,760
would be the worst one we tested so we

254
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,320
called it worse practices this one sits

255
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
at the bottom of the screen and users

256
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,279
can just ignore it it is just one big

257
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,000
paragraph of text and just an ok button

258
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
if you want to select other options you

259
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,839
have to click on a cookie preferences

260
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,600
link that is embedded in that big

261
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,240
paragraph text

262
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,839
this is the version that doesn't

263
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,839
actually have a banner it just has a

264
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,920
cookie preferences button in the lower

265
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,399
right which is also something we saw on

266
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,640
websites you click on the button then

267
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,920
you get a list of your cookie choices

268
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,240
we set up the cups and such website so

269
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,560
that when someone arrived at the website

270
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
they would see one of the 12 cookie

271
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
consent banners

272
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,320
we ran the study on the prolific crowd

273
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
working platform and had over 1100

274
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,839
participants complete our study

275
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,079
we invited participants to help us test

276
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,480
the new cups and such website we paid

277
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
them each five dollars and they took

278
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,519
about 16 minutes to complete the study

279
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,760
we asked each participant to take a look

280
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
at the cups and such website select a

281
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,760
product and put it in their shopping

282
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
cart

283
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
after they did that we asked them some

284
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
questions

285
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,000
we started by asking them what product

286
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,640
they selected and how easy or difficult

287
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
they found using the website

288
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
then we asked them whether they recalled

289
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
making a privacy related decision and if

290
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
so what it was about and what decision

291
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,040
they made

292
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
we wanted to see whether they remembered

293
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,279
encountering the cookie consent banner

294
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,120
and what choice they had made in this

295
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,200
fairly realistic scenario where they

296
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,279
were not actually focused on the cookie

297
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,640
banner

298
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,000
we asked them a number of other

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,399
questions about their consent decision

300
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,320
and what they expected to happen as a

301
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,519
result

302
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,680
then we sent them back to the cups and

303
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,079
such website and asked participants to

304
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,399
revisit most of the questions this time

305
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
while looking at the website

306
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,240
this allowed us to see whether people

307
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,920
had a better understanding of the

308
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
consent banner when they focused their

309
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,399
attention on it we also asked them what

310
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,880
they would do if they changed their mind

311
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,480
and wanted to make a different cookie

312
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,360
choice

313
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
finally we asked them some demographic

314
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
questions

315
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,800
let me give you a few highlights from

316
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,399
our results

317
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
first let's look at what consent

318
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,560
decisions people actually made

319
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,800
each row represents one of our 12

320
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,839
conditions the people who accepted only

321
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,079
strictly necessary cookies are shown in

322
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,040
red the people who accepted all cookies

323
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
are shown in green and the people who

324
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,600
didn't make any selection are shown in

325
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,560
purple

326
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,320
the people who made fine-grained cookie

327
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,560
decisions are shown in blue not very

328
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
many of those

329
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,079
the first thing we see is that the

330
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,839
interfaces where you have to click

331
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,839
through a button or link to get to the

332
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,240
cookie settings hardly anyone rejected

333
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,480
any cookies there is very little red or

334
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,360
blue

335
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
without the embedded options most

336
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
participants didn't bother checking the

337
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
cookie preference options and said they

338
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,000
didn't think about it carefully and just

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,560
chose the easiest option

340
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,639
on the other hand in the interfaces

341
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,160
where all the cookie options were

342
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,560
embedded in the consent banner about a

343
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
third of the participants rejected some

344
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,800
of the cookies and these participants

345
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
were much more likely to say they

346
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,959
actually thought about the decision

347
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,200
among the interfaces that were basically

348
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
the same as the best practices condition

349
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
except for differences in some of the

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,040
wordings or whether the text was

351
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,959
formatted in bullets or one big

352
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,959
paragraph the differences in the

353
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,320
decision participants made were minimal

354
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,399
we can also see that in the corner

355
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,320
button condition not a single

356
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,399
participant made any kind of cookie

357
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,600
decision the bar is all purple in fact

358
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
in all the non-blocking interfaces there

359
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
were some participants who did not

360
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
interact with the cookie banner at all

361
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,399
and participants in these conditions had

362
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,480
much less awareness of what their cookie

363
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,040
options were

364
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,959
we also looked at whether participants

365
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,959
were able to figure out how to change

366
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,880
their decision and whether having a

367
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
persistent cookie preferences button

368
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,680
helps

369
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,720
in the best practices condition 82

370
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,639
of participants saw the button and said

371
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,560
they would use it to reverse their

372
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,639
decision

373
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,720
on the other hand those who were in the

374
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,959
condition without a cookie preferences

375
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,519
button often didn't know how to reverse

376
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,959
their decision

377
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,839
only 45 noticed the link to the cookie

378
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,160
policy and said they would click that

379
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,079
thus we see that the persistent cookie

380
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,000
preferences button is a much more

381
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,720
visible way to let participants know how

382
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,560
to change their decision

383
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
we also asked participants about the

384
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,480
four types of cookies shown in this

385
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,560
banner to see if they understood what

386
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,519
they are

387
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,680
we asked them multiple choice questions

388
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,519
and asked them to identify the correct

389
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,160
definitions of each type of cookie while

390
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
most participants correctly identified

391
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
strictly necessary and targeting cookies

392
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,959
only about 48

393
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,120
correctly identified the definition of

394
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,920
performance cookie and 16

395
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,000
correctly identified the definition of

396
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,560
functional cookies i want to point out

397
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
that these are the standard terms used

398
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,279
for cookies in the onetrust cmp

399
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,760
and some of the other cmps as well

400
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
these terms were actually put forward in

401
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,760
2012 by the uk international chamber of

402
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,000
commerce but it is not clear whether

403
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
these terms were ever tested with users

404
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
for example functional cookies are

405
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,199
cookies that are used to help

406
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,000
personalize the website but many users

407
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,240
in our study confuse them with strictly

408
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,399
necessary cookies which are needed for

409
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,560
the website to work properly

410
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,720
cookie bot actually uses different words

411
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
and calls functional cookies preferences

412
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,800
cookies my students have done some

413
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
preliminary studies to try to come up

414
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,360
with alternative cookie categories and

415
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,519
see if they make sense to users

416
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,279
we found that the terms preferences

417
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
cookies and personalized experience

418
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,639
cookies were much clearer to users than

419
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,160
functional cookies

420
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,240
hopefully we'll have more results soon

421
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,079
and a proposal for standard cookie

422
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,639
language that makes sense to more users

423
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,040
than the current categories

424
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,199
recently my students have also built a

425
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,079
new version of the cups and such website

426
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
and this time they used the one trust

427
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,199
cmp to implement 14 cookie banner

428
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
variations

429
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,680
we're trying some new variations

430
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,000
including using the one trust accordion

431
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,519
feature

432
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,600
we also implemented a three button

433
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,680
version with purple buttons for except

434
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,639
only necessary and accept all as well as

435
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,079
a button to edit cookie preferences

436
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,160
i would like to wrap things up with some

437
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,639
recommendations first of all if you

438
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,279
aren't going to offer any choices don't

439
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,480
bother users with a consent banner

440
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,199
privacy laws do not require you to offer

441
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,320
a notice and have users swatted away and

442
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
some regulators have explicitly

443
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,880
recommended against cookie banners that

444
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,199
do not offer choices

445
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,880
if you have determined that you don't

446
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,280
need to give users choices then don't

447
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,679
give them pointless cookie banners

448
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,240
if you are going to give users choices

449
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,919
don't bury them behind the cookie

450
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,559
preferences or choose cookies link or

451
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,720
anything like that

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,199
with the interface on the top left users

453
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,679
have to click the choose cookies link

454
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
and then figure out what their choices

455
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
are and our research shows that most

456
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,320
users are hesitant to do that with the

457
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,799
interface on the right users can see all

458
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,039
their choices up front and it is just as

459
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,360
easy to make any of them

460
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,080
or if you want to simplify things a bit

461
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,320
the one on the bottom left offers users

462
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
the ability to reject cookies just as

463
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,200
easily as they accept cookies and also

464
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
includes a button for those who want to

465
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,320
manage their preferences further

466
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,120
another issue is whether to have a fully

467
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
blocking cookie banner a less

468
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
conspicuous banner or button at the

469
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,600
bottom of the screen might provide a

470
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,240
better user experience except that we

471
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
know that most users will never interact

472
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,720
with it and might not even notice it

473
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,120
if the default cookie setting is to only

474
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
set strictly necessary cookies that

475
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,720
might be okay

476
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,559
but if there is a less privacy

477
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
protective default then by being

478
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,039
unobtrusive you are actually nudging

479
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,320
users to accept this low privacy default

480
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
in some jurisdictions this is actually

481
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,880
illegal but even where it is allowed

482
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,080
this is not a privacy friendly approach

483
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,880
so now we have a dilemma because we know

484
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
that users don't want to have to stop at

485
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,760
every website and make a cookie decision

486
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
but at the same time we want to give

487
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,400
users choices and make it easy for them

488
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,320
to protect their privacy

489
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
for the time being we're stuck with

490
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,200
cookie banner solutions but ultimately i

491
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
think we need to move to automated

492
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
decisions to reduce user burden we've

493
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,240
tried this with p3p and later do not

494
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,039
track and unfortunately we were not able

495
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,120
to gain the industry support for these

496
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,360
standards to catch on

497
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,280
there are some new proposals that would

498
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
allow users to set up their browsers

499
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,520
with their cookie preferences and have

500
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
their browser signal to the website

501
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
automatically as to which types of

502
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,480
cookies a user is willing to accept

503
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,559
i think the only way we are going to

504
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,799
make consent decisions scale without

505
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,919
burdening users is to adopt automated

506
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
solutions and this seems unlikely to

507
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,120
happen without a legal mandate

508
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,480
in the meantime

509
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
hopefully our research offers some

510
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,799
useful recommendations about how we can

511
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,200
make cookie consent interfaces a bit

512
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,600
more usable and useful to users

513
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
