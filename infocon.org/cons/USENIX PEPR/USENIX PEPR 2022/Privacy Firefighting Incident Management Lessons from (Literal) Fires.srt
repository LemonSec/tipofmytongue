00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,320
hi everyone my name is katie hufker and

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
i'm a software engineer on the privacy

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
infrastructure team at meta i spend a

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
lot of time working on privacy incidents

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,480
i help ensure they're handled quickly

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
and effectively and review them to

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
ensure that we're learning all we can so

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,480
we can do better in the future

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,320
during kovid after i gave up on my

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,960
sourdough starter i decided i needed a

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
reason to get out of the house and

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,960
decided to join the local volunteer fire

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,719
department

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,680
after spending some

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,640
after dealing with fires and real-life

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,800
emergencies in the physical world i

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,160
realized there are some parallels

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,079
between the two and wanted to share some

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,320
of those with all of you

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
so before we really get started what is

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,120
a privacy incident it basically means

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
that something's broken and maybe we're

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,760
violating either an internal policy or

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
an external commitment we make to our

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,480
users

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,879
two of these examples were that we had

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,680
unencrypted payroll device on a stolen

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
external storage drive

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,119
this is notable because we do care about

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,200
the privacy of our employees as well as

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
that of our end users

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
another

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,759
one that

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,439
is pretty representative is that a

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,680
non-friend could comment on a live

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
stream video that had the comments

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
restricted to only friends so we

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,320
violated one of our privacy settings

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
one notable thing about how we handle

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,600
things at meta is we treat

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
vulnerabilities largely the same as

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
active incidents from one we don't

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
always know right away if they're being

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,920
actively exploited and regardless it's

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
important that we mitigate them quickly

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
and effectively and learn from them so

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,079
we can improve going forward

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,439
so first we need to figure out that

49
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,000
there is an incident in the first place

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
so on the fire side in the u.s even very

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
young children are taught to dial 9-1-1

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
if there's an emergency

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,399
from there they reach a trained

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,320
dispatcher who's able to gather all of

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,040
the necessary information to dispatch

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,759
resources according to a pre-plan so for

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,600
example if there were fire at my house

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,758
right now i know i'd get three engines

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,920
from our local fire department one each

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,520
from three neighboring departments and

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,879
an ambulance

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,879
to dispatch these they send tones out

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,280
over the radio that activate pagers or

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
alarms and stations that are loud enough

65
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
to wake up people even if they're

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,080
sleeping

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,640
so how do we do this on the privacy side

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
first we need to ensure we have ways for

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,400
everyone to flag potential privacy

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
issues even if they're a new joiner even

71
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,640
if they're not an engineer don't work on

72
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,280
privacy even external users through

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
things like bug bounty programs

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,519
then we need calibrated people who are

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,000
able to help triage and pull to

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
determine the severity of the incident

77
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,800
as well as pull in help so it can get

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
resolved especially at a large company

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,959
like meta it's hard to know who's on

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,360
call for what at any given moment so we

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
have a helpful on-call tool where people

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
can easily look that up in addition we

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,319
have robo-dial tooling so we can call

84
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,800
people and it's set up to bypass silent

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
on their phone so ideally we can reach

86
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
them even in the middle of the night if

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,200
necessary

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,760
one other thing to note is that here

89
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
we'd rather have false positives than

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,280
false negatives

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,239
one example of this on the 911 side is

92
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,640
we had someone call about a bird stuck

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
on a telephone pole that had flown away

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,319
when we got there but they thought there

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,760
was an emergency

96
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
likewise for privacy incidents it's

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
better to

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
make sure we're

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,120
getting potential issues flagged

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
likewise we don't want to go against

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,599
issues because that might disincentivize

102
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
people from looking for privacy issues

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,200
or filing them as incidents so we can

104
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,840
handle them

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,959
appropriately so now that we have an

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,319
incident we need to figure out the

107
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
extent of the incident

108
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,480
so for a private or for actual fire the

109
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
first thing you do when you get on

110
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
when you get on scene is the officer

111
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,879
someone on the truck is gonna give a

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,120
size up to report what you have so for

113
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
this picture i might say engine one to

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,439
dispatch i have a single story building

115
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,920
with heavy smoke and fire that way both

116
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
dispatch and any incoming units know

117
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,920
what's going on and what to expect when

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,439
they arrive to help

119
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,279
next someone takes the time to do a full

120
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,798
walk around the building so they can

121
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,560
look for things like do we have

122
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
potential victims are there any

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,960
exposures that might also catch out

124
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,000
catch fire do we have downed power lines

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
that way we're able to prioritize action

126
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
so we can help

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
make sure we're protecting life safety

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,400
of both potential victims as well as our

129
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,960
responders

130
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,840
um

131
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,160
and it's very important too all of this

132
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,000
information is communicated over the

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,240
radio so again incoming units know what

134
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,800
to expect when they get there

135
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,040
so when you file a privacy incident in

136
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,199
whatever centralized place your company

137
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,680
uses make sure the initial report makes

138
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
it clear what's going on and it's not

139
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,240
just

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
generic product has generic privacy

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,440
issue

142
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
then take a few minutes to do a virtual

143
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
walk around of sorts do we know if the

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
issue is being actively exploited what's

145
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
the real world privacy impact does this

146
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
affect potentially all of our users or

147
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,039
just a very small subset

148
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,199
also as part of this consider whether it

149
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,800
might make sense to just turn off the

150
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,720
feature temporarily until you're able to

151
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,360
mitigate the privacy issue

152
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
also make sure that you're posting all

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
of this on the centralized incident to

154
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,039
keep people up to date

155
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,120
also for particularly large incidents

156
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
you might want to consider splitting

157
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
things into work streams so you might

158
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,560
have one set of people working on

159
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
mitigation while another set of people

160
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,280
are working on the forward fix

161
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
for any incident communication is

162
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,520
critical for making sure everything goes

163
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,800
smoothly

164
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,320
so when we're on scene for a fire other

165
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,479
emergency every 20 minutes we get a

166
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
status check from dispatch asking for a

167
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
status update and to ensure that

168
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,120
everyone's alive these aren't optional

169
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
if we don't respond to these they're

170
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
going to keep calling and if we still

171
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
don't respond they're going to send law

172
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
enforcement or someone else to make sure

173
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,199
everyone's okay

174
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,080
likewise we use plain language while 10

175
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,240
codes were a thing of the past in 1040

176
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
might be a slightly shorter way of

177
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
saying there's a fire there is not a

178
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
point if not everyone on scene or

179
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
listening on the radio understands what

180
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,440
it means

181
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
so on the privacy side please please

182
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,160
please make sure you're posting

183
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
regular status updates in

184
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,319
whatever centralized place you're using

185
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
for the incident while chat threads are

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,240
great for real real-time communication

187
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,919
it can be really frustrating when you

188
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,440
try and dive into help and you have to

189
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,759
read 200 messages to get up to speed on

190
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,000
what in the world is going on

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
if you think that you're too busy for

192
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,280
this it probably means that you need to

193
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,199
pull in more people to help

194
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,680
also avoid acronyms and abbreviations

195
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
particularly if they're team specific

196
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
because again it can make people from

197
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,199
other teams who are coming to help have

198
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,440
a harder time getting up to speed

199
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
and finally especially for larger

200
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
incidents you might need to work with

201
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
non-engineering teams such as

202
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,160
potentially com so make sure you have

203
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,319
people who are adept at communicating

204
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,160
between engineer and non-engineer is

205
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
necessary

206
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,560
and finally after an incident is over we

207
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
need to ensure that we're doing better

208
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,000
next time

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,599
this is something where the fire service

210
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,919
side could honestly do a lot better

211
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,080
we have reports that we file after every

212
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,039
incident

213
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,120
but other than maybe a really really

214
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
large incident any formal review is

215
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
probably going to be limited to some

216
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
conversation while we're trying to get

217
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,000
the hose back on the fire truck

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,160
for privacy incidents we also use

219
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,960
reports we then have experienced

220
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
engineers look over the report for a few

221
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,680
key things namely detection or whether

222
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
we're able to find similar issues in an

223
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,160
automated fashion escalation or whether

224
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,840
we were able to quickly pull in the

225
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,160
people we needed remediation or whether

226
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
the issue was thoroughly handled and

227
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,919
prevention or whether we can prevent

228
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,000
this and similar issues from reoccurring

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,120
in the future

230
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
if we realize that we're lacking in one

231
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,039
of these areas we pull all of the

232
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,919
stakeholders into a formal review where

233
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,599
we can determine what the necessary

234
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,840
follow-ups are and come up with a plan

235
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
for ensuring that those get completed

236
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,840
even after an issue is mitigated we need

237
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
to ensure that we're doing everything

238
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
necessary to prevent similar issues from

239
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
happening and leave our systems and

240
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
processes in a better state

241
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,840
so to sum things up incidents are going

242
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
to happen so make sure you have a plan

243
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,919
beforehand know what your centralized

244
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,399
place for communication is going to be

245
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,000
know how you're going to get a hold of

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
people

247
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,279
then during an incident make sure you're

248
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,279
communicating effectively throughout and

249
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,679
posting status updates frequently and

250
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,519
finally when the incident is finally

251
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
over it's not really over until you've

252
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,080
taken the time to reflect on it and

253
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
realize what other things can be

254
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,160
improved so you can do better in the

255
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
future

256
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,680
thank you
