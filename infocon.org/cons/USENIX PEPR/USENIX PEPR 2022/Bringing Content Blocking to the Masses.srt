1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
hey all um

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,880
i'm siobhan i'm anton and we're here to

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
talk about how we ship content blocking

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,359
to 50 million users actually 60 million

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,520
users um as of this month

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,320
at brave and we do a lot of privacy

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,640
focused stuff at brave so this is it's

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,480
really cool to be here to be around

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
like-minded uh people

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
so just a quick note before we get into

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
it when we talk about content blocking

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
we mean ad blocking or tracker blocking

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
as people call it um it's more

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
kind of you use these terms

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
interchangeably

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
so the talk in a slide um we're going to

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,440
go we're going to talk about why ad

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
blocking is important for privacy in

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,320
particular and not just cosmetic

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
filtering um and and also talk about why

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,039
um

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,480
it's hard to maintain

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
the engine that powers us and also we'll

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,520
talk about

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
um the challenges that we ran into while

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
shipping this to millions of users and

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
how kind of a unique thing in the ad

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,720
blocking community uh and also mentioned

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,760
and also we had to do a bunch of

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,200
research because a lot of these problems

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,240
were novel

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,680
um and

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
yeah also talk about

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
how it was really great to be able to

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,680
leverage a community project for this

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,240
cool um so who uses ad blockers a lot of

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,479
people and this was an imc study in

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,640
2016. i'm sure this number is even

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,479
higher now

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,880
and not just for ad blocking like i said

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,200
also for privacy a lot of people have

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,640
acknowledged this

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
including the nsa and um

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
the us cyber security infrastructure

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,200
security agency mainly because um yeah

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
with an app blocker you get um network

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
traffic filtering abilities on your on

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
your own client so you can block a lot

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,720
of

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,040
tracking scripts and just prevent a lot

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,840
of

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,240
network exfiltration but importantly

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,399
from a client point of view and not a

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,240
you know network admin point of view so

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,200
just quickly step through what it means

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,639
what it would talk what we're talking

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,520
about when we

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
talk about ad blocking and what that

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
looks like in practice so you go to a

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,760
random website and you see an ad down

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,959
there

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
and you would like to not see that ad

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
and it turns out that that ad is

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,239
inserted by a script and that script has

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,040
a name called exp ads dash blocked dot

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,920
js

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,319
so this would be a filter rule you would

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,400
add a filter rule like this to your ad

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,879
blocker engine

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,879
so basically saying that if you load a

71
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,800
script that matches this name

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
then you should block it

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,879
um and then

74
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,720
that's how the ad is blocked and in

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
brave if you look at dev tools you'll

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
see that that script actually shows up

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,720
as blocked

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,959
by the by the ad blocker

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,400
so this kind of brings us to the

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
question what are filter lists

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,159
they're simply collections collections

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,720
of rules um the same kind of rules that

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
i talked about in the previous slide

84
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
and the two biggest examples are easy

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,200
list and easy privacy um the two i guess

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,840
most most actively maintained over like

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
decades

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,879
and this is kind of like

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,480
this is kind of what it looks like just

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
like thousands of rules

91
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
um an easy list and easy privacy and

92
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,159
these are fed into

93
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,920
basically every single ad blocker that

94
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
exists so brave

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,959
abp adblock pro or ublock origin

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,680
chromium also uses easylist for

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
figuring out which ads are acceptable

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,720
and ad guard so yes if you've used an ad

99
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
blocker you've used your filter list

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,879
um so this brings us to the question why

101
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,040
are they hard to maintain

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,560
and the biggest problem that we face is

103
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,440
that

104
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,200
or the community faces is that rules go

105
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,640
obsolete like all the time um so sim

106
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,799
very simple example of this is that the

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,319
name will just change so instead of

108
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,360
being called

109
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
exp ads dash blocked it's now called exp

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,040
ads

111
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
dash date time

112
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,640
this could be

113
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,239
benign because

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,439
you know the let's say the website

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,200
operator just changed their ad library

116
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,760
or it could also be malicious because

117
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
they're trying to actively get around ad

118
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,799
blockers but the point is that

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
our adblocking engine has no way of

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,199
figuring out what thing to block now

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,639
so yeah so the ad now exists again

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,160
and

123
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,800
this is problematic and if you think

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,320
about the ad that we saw in the previous

125
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,160
slide like that's kind of obvious a user

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
can see oh my ad blocker is not working

127
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,040
which is not great um but it's i think

128
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,280
it's a much more serious problem that

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
a lot of the invisible tracking scripts

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,960
are now running even though the user

131
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
thought that they're safe so they're

132
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
kind of worse off at this point

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
and you can't just block

134
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,000
like you know add star.js because you

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,360
will end up breaking

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
most of the web

137
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,479
so an ad blocker can't really do that we

138
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,280
have to be extremely particular to the

139
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
specific to the script or resource that

140
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,280
we're blocking

141
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,800
it's also kind of uniquely bad for a

142
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
privacy focused product to

143
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
you know face this problem because we're

144
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,560
shipping ad blocking and if the ads

145
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,759
don't get blocked that's kind of a

146
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,440
problem

147
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
so so the question is and the problem

148
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,639
that we were facing was how do we

149
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,440
identify ad block evasion

150
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,759
and this is this was an open problem and

151
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,520
the solution that we kind of came up

152
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
with was

153
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
what we're really looking for

154
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,639
is not names is it's actually how the

155
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,240
script executes

156
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
so what we ended up doing was

157
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,639
we create a signature of the tracker

158
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
script as it executes on the v8

159
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,800
javascript engine

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,039
on a on a loop-by-loop basis

161
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,120
and from that signature we can then run

162
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
a web crawl or a web measurement study

163
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
and you can use that to catch similar

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,680
uh scripts that were just you know

165
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,720
obfuscated or renamed or inlined

166
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,280
this was pretty successful we presented

167
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,479
it at ieee snp last year

168
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,319
and we also shipped new filter-less

169
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,680
rules based on the measurement study

170
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,199
that we carried out

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,199
i contributed this back to easy list and

172
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,120
easy privacy

173
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,720
so yeah so we come to the second problem

174
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
which i think is a much harder problem

175
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
to fix just generally for i think all

176
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
web browsers

177
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,199
is um that care about privacy

178
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,440
is like how do you prevent website

179
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,120
breakage across the web

180
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,479
because these rules can actually break

181
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,919
websites

182
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,360
and now let's

183
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
step through some code which is always

184
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,759
fun in a live presentation but this is

185
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,560
this is a simple a simple web page so it

186
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,000
should not be too bad

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,120
um so it's an html page um and it loads

188
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
an evil.comtrack.js

189
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
script

190
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,600
which

191
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,199
we want to block

192
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,520
and um but what's the way it's set up

193
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,639
it's interesting

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,520
is that it calls track user which is the

195
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,199
privacy harmful

196
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,160
function that we want to block

197
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,599
but it passes in a benign and a good

198
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,759
function called setup page

199
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,240
as a callback so this is a problem

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,440
because

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
what happens if you just block

202
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
a track user you will actually

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,319
break the page because set a body in

204
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
this example will now no longer be

205
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,880
set up so

206
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,160
it's not as simple as just blocking

207
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,240
track.js you're going to get a reference

208
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
error and the whole page breaks so you

209
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
blocked the ad but you also blocked the

210
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
website

211
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
so so this is also extremely bad as you

212
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,080
can imagine for a browser if we break

213
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,919
web pages that's kind of the thing that

214
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,560
people use a browser for so retaining

215
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,840
and acquiring users is crucial

216
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,680
especially as a young privacy focused

217
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,039
project

218
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:35,840
and

219
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
also i think how

220
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,960
we differ from

221
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
other ad blocking projects is that we

222
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,960
don't expect users to be technical we

223
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,120
would definitely not scale to millions

224
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
of hundreds of millions of users if that

225
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,919
was the case so ad blocking and

226
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,280
generally like all of our privacy

227
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
protect protecting mechanisms should

228
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
work out of the box

229
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,160
you should not be able to you should not

230
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,759
be expected to know what a filter list

231
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,080
rule is or what easy list is or what any

232
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,680
of these things mean it should just you

233
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,479
should be protected by default

234
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,000
and also we

235
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
have a lot of users and this is true for

236
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,319
a lot of the folks here

237
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,160
we have lot we have users and places

238
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,759
where folks don't have the latest

239
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,800
hardware

240
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,879
and we can't just say you know we don't

241
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,000
care we actually actively care because

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,960
um

243
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,479
that's you know that's where our users

244
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,440
are so we have to think about compat

245
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,879
across

246
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,960
and across the scale across the scale of

247
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,720
the web

248
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,479
so the solution to this problem was

249
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,240
creating privacy preserving script

250
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,919
replacements

251
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,360
and what that means is that we generate

252
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,519
again based on javascript execution we

253
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,599
generate a privacy preserving version of

254
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,959
the bad script

255
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,480
and in this way we kind of solve for the

256
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,200
privacy versus compatibility trade-off

257
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
um or privacy versus utility as it's

258
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
called

259
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
generally so we solve for that trade-off

260
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,680
by automating the creation of um the

261
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,640
like the privacy of the bad script

262
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,880
and what that looks like is

263
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,080
that the previous example

264
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,399
now instead of loading track.js

265
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,600
we load a sugarcoated track.js which is

266
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,279
essentially all the privacy harmful

267
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,080
accesses such as you know cookie setting

268
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
or

269
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,279
any kind of like bad thing that we might

270
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,880
want to block

271
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
we now create a stub version of that

272
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,000
script

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,080
so now when you call the tracking

274
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,040
function

275
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,519
um all the api accesses for that script

276
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,959
look the same so the website still

277
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,800
thinks it's calling track user on

278
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,600
track.js but actually it's calling a

279
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
local resource that has been

280
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
sugar-coated

281
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
and that's actually not harmful for the

282
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,959
user and we don't break the callback and

283
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,640
all of that stuff so the page actually

284
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
would get set up correctly

285
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,519
and this paper was presented at ccs last

286
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,040
year

287
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,880
and we shipped it

288
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
but we did ran into some issues which

289
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,160
was kind of interesting

290
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
because you know the research prototype

291
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
exists and we were like great fantastic

292
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
let's ship it um we did some browser

293
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
engineering ship created a bunch of

294
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
resources and we were we were careful

295
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,320
about the fact that we knew that we

296
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,000
couldn't just ship like 1 000 megabytes

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
in every single browser instance but

298
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,880
we

299
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,480
rolled out slowly

300
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,600
but it turned out that um

301
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,760
on devices with low ram

302
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,160
a low available ram um

303
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
the browser still ended up crashing when

304
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
it was trying to load like hundreds of

305
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
scripts um

306
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,399
like at runtime

307
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,920
and um this we you know we tested on

308
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,399
local beefy i guess devices and ci but

309
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,360
we never

310
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
uh ended up testing on devices with like

311
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
you know where the browser is not the

312
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
only thing running

313
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,480
there's other stuff running as well so

314
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,279
um

315
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,560
this was a problem and we ended up

316
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,920
having to roll back

317
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,240
but now we know that we have to our perv

318
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,040
testing has to be a lot more robust

319
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,440
for you know the use for like making

320
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
sure that we

321
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
scale across like a lot of different

322
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
devices and hardware

323
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,079
so yeah so that's

324
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,839
kind of what we do from a from a

325
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,440
research and development point of view

326
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,160
anton's going to talk about how

327
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,519
you know we support the filterless

328
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
community we have taken an essentially a

329
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,839
open source community project which was

330
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,600
easy-less and easy privacy and we're

331
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,040
using it but we also want to make sure

332
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,120
that we build trust with that community

333
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,959
and give back um and that's actually a

334
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,680
superpower i think so over to you anton

335
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,480
yeah thank you siobhan so yeah obviously

336
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,440
there's a lot of research and

337
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
engineering that goes into

338
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,120
building a product like this

339
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,000
um

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,240
but again we're building on top of ad

341
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,839
blocking which is

342
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,560
very much a crowdsourced uh

343
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,040
thing so there's a lot of work that goes

344
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,480
into the community

345
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
um and so one thing that we do at brave

346
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
which is awesome is uh i don't know if

347
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,000
anyone here has been looking into ad

348
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,680
blocking at all but if you have you've

349
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,920
probably heard of ryan brown

350
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,839
uh he's kind of a legend in the ad

351
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,360
blocking community uh he basically

352
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,720
maintains uh easy list and easy privacy

353
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,639
and um

354
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,959
so he's been doing that since basically

355
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,519
before github indexes contributions so i

356
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,839
don't even know how long he's been doing

357
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,880
it um

358
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,560
we we ended up hiring him in 2019 and

359
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,720
that's just a great way to

360
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,240
kind of give back to the community we're

361
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,760
we're sustaining

362
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,480
uh the efforts of filterless maintainers

363
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
and making sure that

364
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,279
some weird circumstance isn't going to

365
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,560
bring this whole

366
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,480
uh community crashing down of course

367
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,680
there's plenty of other filter list

368
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,600
maintainers and we're extremely grateful

369
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,959
for what they do and we try to support

370
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,880
them as best as we can

371
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,839
at all times

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and another thing that we do at brave is

373
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,800
uh

374
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,440
we're very

375
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,519
we keep a very close watch on uh

376
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,839
feedback channels so we look at github

377
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,440
and twitter and reddit

378
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
and our own community forums

379
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,839
and uh every now and then somebody will

380
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,440
post a

381
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
notification saying that hey look

382
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
something is uh broken on this website

383
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,880
in brave

384
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,760
and

385
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,680
we do our very best to go ahead and try

386
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,399
to get a fix for those within a day

387
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,480
we can push new filter list rules to

388
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
everyone and

389
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
basically

390
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,480
if we can get that fixed in a day

391
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,959
they're usually extremely happy about it

392
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,600
and uh that's great for us because uh

393
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,800
they might come back and support and uh

394
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,399
give us another report of something

395
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,279
broken

396
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,600
so that really helps us to stay on top

397
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,839
of web compatibility fixes um because

398
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,959
that's

399
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,200
one of our quickest ways of finding

400
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,399
something across the entire internet

401
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,000
of course there's also our nightly and

402
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,560
beta channels so

403
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
that's where we actually ship new

404
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
browser features before they make it to

405
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,720
the release channel and we have a few

406
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,199
power users who are on there and

407
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,440
they really like to see this kind of

408
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
first sneak peek of new

409
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,480
privacy features that are coming up so

410
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,920
they often are pretty technical and

411
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,279
we'll post on github if something's

412
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,880
broken there too so that's great to have

413
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,279
uh of course as a privacy company we

414
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,120
don't want to force users to post on

415
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
social media if they're having an issue

416
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
with their website

417
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,480
so we actually ended up building out

418
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,600
this in-browser reporting system where

419
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,079
it'll send the url of the page you're on

420
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,680
if you choose to use it

421
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,240
um but otherwise all this data is like

422
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
completely opt-in so you can add as much

423
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
or as little information about the page

424
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,959
breakage as you want you can add an

425
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,800
optional follow-up

426
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,399
either email address or twitter address

427
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,720
or anything it's just a free form

428
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,680
field

429
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,959
and

430
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,959
we we do our best to stay on top of

431
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,959
those we get actually about 2000 reports

432
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,040
per day through this system

433
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,839
but

434
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,680
ryan and a couple others do a great job

435
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,839
of staying on top of this and building

436
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,360
out nice dashboards and things so that

437
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,800
we can actually filter through this data

438
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,680
in a meaningful way

439
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,800
um

440
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,440
so yeah okay ad blocking works using an

441
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
ad blocking engine uh basically code

442
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,639
that will parse filter rules and be able

443
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,160
to match on them and really efficiently

444
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,519
at runtime

445
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,560
um

446
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,639
and so i personally maintain adblock

447
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,440
rust which is brave's ad blocking engine

448
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,720
but just because i maintain

449
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,639
our ad blocking engine and other ad

450
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,720
blockers use different engines

451
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,480
doesn't mean that we are competitors or

452
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
working against each other it's really a

453
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
community effort

454
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,480
and so like i've personally filed issues

455
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,320
against ublock origin and

456
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
klix's ad blocker and ad guard and

457
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
being able to get

458
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,839
minor incompatibilities between engines

459
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,800
fixed

460
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
and fixing security issues and things

461
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,600
like that

462
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,440
overall just really helps the ecosystem

463
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,360
as a whole because if you have a

464
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
fragmented space

465
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,199
and every ad blocker is doing something

466
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
slightly different with the same set of

467
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,240
rules

468
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,040
you're going to create a lot of

469
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,360
fragmentation and

470
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,959
there's only so much effort that can go

471
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,199
into filter list maintenance so making

472
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,040
sure that that's all working the same

473
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,279
way is really useful

474
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,279
and another awesome thing about brave is

475
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,720
that we have a really strong open source

476
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,880
culture so everything from our adblock

477
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,040
engine to the lists we use to the

478
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,880
resources that we ship as replacements

479
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
for things

480
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,680
uh for scripts and images and things

481
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,600
like that and of course the whole

482
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,160
browser itself that's all open source

483
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,959
and free the freely licensed so

484
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,920
uh

485
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
what's awesome is that we've actually

486
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,920
had third-party browser projects coming

487
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,600
in and using our adblock engine in their

488
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,839
own browser uh so you might have heard

489
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,079
of cute browser which is a kind of

490
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,959
vim focused uh key binding

491
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,680
browser very minimal and then angelfish

492
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,880
browser is a

493
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
android

494
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,040
browser replacement so those both use

495
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,320
adblock rust

496
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,680
developers from those projects have

497
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
filed issues and pr's on adblock rust

498
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
and that's just really helped to make it

499
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
more robust and

500
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,839
having the development in the open kind

501
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
of helps everyone there

502
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,199
and again with the the sugarcoat

503
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,680
resources that siobhan mentioned

504
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
we weren't ready to ship those in the

505
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,240
browser immediately but

506
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,039
we

507
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,799
we basically open sourced them as soon

508
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,799
as we publish the paper just to make

509
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,319
them available to the broader privacy

510
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,160
community

511
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
and and even now we're not using all of

512
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,959
them quite yet but they're all available

513
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,319
for people to use

514
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,160
um

515
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,319
so yeah i'll give it back to siobhan to

516
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,480
kind of close it up here sure yeah

517
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
basically just wanted to have this light

518
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,880
up while people ask questions

519
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,960
yeah so privacy is meaningless without

520
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
compatibility it doesn't matter if your

521
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
if your product is the most privacy

522
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
preserving if it doesn't work so um it's

523
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,640
and i think the interesting thing is

524
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,320
that like we talked a lot about

525
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
trade-offs but i think

526
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,440
there's often

527
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,360
like this low hanging fruit and maybe

528
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
not so low hanging fruit in research to

529
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,600
get best of both worlds so i think we

530
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,720
should be investing in that research

531
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,919
and research shipping research is hard

532
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,200
make sure that you have a real black

533
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,720
roll back plan and make sure that you

534
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,640
perf test um

535
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,160
and yeah it's really important like

536
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,919
anton said to set up

537
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,440
feedback channels so that you get quick

538
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,039
feedback on especially when you're

539
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,400
shipping like a little bit more

540
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,080
sensitive or a little bit more

541
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,160
um you know cutting edge privacy stuff

542
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
then it's really important to hear from

543
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080
users if that is actually breaking their

544
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,679
use cases um and they love it when you

545
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,720
you know

546
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
fix something really fast as opposed to

547
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
saying that it'll be in the next release

548
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,600
which is three months from now

549
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
you know good luck

550
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,160
and

551
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,840
and and also i think this is really

552
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,880
important i think it's really important

553
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,720
to build trust with the community

554
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,080
by hiring and supporting and

555
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
contributing back and it's ultimately

556
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,559
better for everyone

557
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,080
if you know there's more privacy on the

558
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,960
web

559
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,520
and that is it those are our socials

560
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,240
happy to take any questions

561
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
you
