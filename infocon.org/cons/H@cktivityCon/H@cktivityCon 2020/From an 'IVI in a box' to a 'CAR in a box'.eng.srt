[Music]

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,919
good morning good afternoon good evening

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,440
depending which time zone you're in

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,799
i i'm ian tabor uh or internet and this

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,160
is my car hacking talk

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,880
from an ivy in a box to a car in a box

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,640
where i go into a car hack i did on one

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,560
of my vehicles previously

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,039
and how i then built a car in a box

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,320
first things first

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,800
who am i you could say i'm the ultimate

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,439
car hacker

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,800
i built this kit car 15 years ago now um

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
it's based on the mid 90's rear wheel

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,399
drive um

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
ford uh running gear and has

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,680
a 2004 ford focus engine up front

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,600
it's got quite a bit of power doesn't

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,920
need too much but not a lot of weight

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,320
goes pretty quick it's complete opposite

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
of the vehicle i hacked

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
um and it only has three ecu's

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,000
and two of those i built myself first

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,559
which is a mega square ecu

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,760
which does the ignition and spark

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,559
for the engine the second is the little

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,479
box as you can see in the top right hand

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,200
corner

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,240
it's a arduino mega based gps data

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,200
logger

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,400
which talks over the can bus to the mega

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,439
square

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,479
gets real-time data from the vehicle to

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,119
see what's happening so i can

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
play with the settings etcetera at a

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,479
later time

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,720
a little disclaimer um car hacking is

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
done at your own risk if you break your

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,799
car

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,520
and you will if you try too hard um

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,640
please don't blame me

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
um i've done it once i made my gearbox

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,240
disappear but managed to get it back by

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,040
turn

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,320
disconnecting the battery for a long

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,280
period of time however

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,200
did have to um take three and a half

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,759
weeks to learn how to change gear again

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,119
so on to my car hiking history

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,240
um in 2018 i did a talk at

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,280
um dc 4420 besides

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,159
rookie track and def con 26 car hanging

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,960
village

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,320
we're browsing from a car what's the

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
worst that can happen that went into

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
more details about this hack

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
the disclosure process the fun that i

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,758
had with manufacturer

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,319
um i will be touching it on it slightly

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,560
but not going into as much detail

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
um 2018

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,239
i was invited by buck crowd to a live

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,280
car hanging event

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
one of 12 researchers there i then

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,040
returned again in 2019 being one of 20

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,280
researchers

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,080
um that was interesting uh come on to

68
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,400
that

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,160
in a bit last year at defcon i was part

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,800
of a

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
car hiking panel with cybergibbons and

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
specters

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
um that's quite interesting general chat

74
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,879
about

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,000
um how we got into it what we've found

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,319
what things we've done um also in 2019

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,840
um i went to the auto isaac

78
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,040
event in texas for hacker one

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,879
as part of a car hacking vulnerability

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,720
disclosure policy

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840
panel um to try and explain

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
that car hackers are actually good for

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,159
the automotive industry um

84
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159
it's quite an interesting time meeting

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,640
manufacturers finding out what their

86
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,239
issues and things are for my sins now i

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,840
also run the car hacking village in the

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,319
uk

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,200
and help out with um the team at defcon

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
i will be bringing my

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
car in the box virtually to defcon this

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,959
year um

93
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,599
so last year i did 12 or 13 events i

94
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,560
think it was

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,400
um this year there was many more planned

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,440
but however corona rs has broken it and

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,959
i've done a couple of virtual ones

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,080
including this one um

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,920
i have been asked to go to almost every

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,280
continent in the world with my current

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,319
box

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,360
india australia brazil

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,560
defcon most of europe egypt

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
um logistically

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
i'd love to but um it's

106
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,000
absolute pain to try and get it anywhere

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,720
so

108
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,239
not going to be happening anytime soon

109
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
unless i can drive there

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,799
so onto the car in question in 2015

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,760
i purchased this ds5 1955 limited

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,320
edition

113
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
it had all the bells and whistles top of

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,839
the range all the toys

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
including a 7-inch touchscreen in the

116
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,199
middle of the dashboard

117
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
which you could surf the internet on if

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
you

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,360
tethered to your mobile phone using

120
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,840
either wi-fi or bluetooth

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
great idea wonderful why you'd want to

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
do it i don't know the ui was absolutely

123
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
useless

124
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,160
but you could tether through um to get

125
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,600
internet access

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
so at the time i was doing lots of long

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,320
journeys up down the country for work

128
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
but being bored one evening i decided to

129
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,440
have a

130
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
little sniff around run map while

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
connected to my phone

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,000
and managed to find four ports open

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,040
twenty three

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
one one one three three three three and

135
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,199
twenty thousand

136
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,759
um my day my day job at the time was

137
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,800
network architects

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,840
so uh everyone knows what 23 does so

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,639
telnet

140
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,160
straight into the head unit no

141
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
credentials requested

142
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
no nothing full access to the file

143
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,199
system

144
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,960
which included the usb socket in the

145
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,639
middle of the dashboard so you could

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
copy data off

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
um having a look around the file system

148
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,680
um

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
there are some folders with some sql

150
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,199
like databases

151
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,440
both system and user ones most of the

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,199
system ones contained

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,919
settings and things for the vehicle um

154
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,840
the user ones

155
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,160
however um those three interesting files

156
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,639
which contained your navigation history

157
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,440
your phone book

158
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,120
and your telephone history um

159
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
and you could also get out all of the

160
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,320
details of every phone that's ever been

161
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,280
connected to the head unit

162
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,440
so um at the time when i first found out

163
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
i didn't really do much with it because

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
um didn't really want to break my car

165
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
it's my daily driver

166
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
but in 2017 i decided to sell it so i

167
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
had a week to find

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
any major vulnerability any other

169
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
releases i could

170
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
so um reading up on the vx works command

171
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
reference guide

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,479
i found out you could map an ftp server

173
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,440
to a file

174
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
file path and extricate the data over

175
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,520
ftp

176
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,120
so you wouldn't even have to be inside

177
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,560
the vehicle to hack the vehicle

178
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
so at this point i wrote up my findings

179
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
contacted the manufacturer psa to which

180
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
their comment was well it's up to the

181
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,639
user to secure their wi-fi

182
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
which is not really right because

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
i'm not saying the wi-fi isn't secure

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
i'm saying the actual device is insecure

185
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,680
by having done it available

186
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,560
so little scenario posed to the people

187
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,199
at

188
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
citron um your mobile phone's dead

189
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,680
you have no internet access so you pull

190
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
into mcdonald's tether your car onto

191
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
mcdonald's wi-fi

192
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,919
um that then gives you internet access

193
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,520
however at the same time

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
someone on the same wi-fi can then run

195
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,840
nmap find out where

196
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
find that port 23 open

197
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,639
go through your file system find out

198
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,400
where you are and potentially rob you

199
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,960
and they're like ooh that's a bad idea

200
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,039
so i know what the fix will be it will

201
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,840
be disable the wi-fi

202
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,599
um problem with that is um the um

203
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,440
the actual exploit is also available

204
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,720
over the bluetooth stack

205
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
using the personal area network so that

206
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,400
didn't really work

207
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,319
but um not really a problem

208
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
so sold the vehicle but then

209
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
i was told by someone one of the

210
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,360
conferences i went to that

211
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
20 000 was actually direct access to the

212
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,440
can bus using dmp3 which is an

213
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,840
industrial control system

214
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,199
protocol still haven't found out how to

215
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,080
generate those packets correctly but i'm

216
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,199
working on it

217
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
slowly so what i did was

218
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,039
purchase the parts to try and get it

219
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
working off of the car

220
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,360
so i went to scrap yard purchased the

221
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
head unit

222
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
which definitely had the wi-fi chipset

223
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,080
because there's a little sticker on the

224
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,919
top that says wi-fi

225
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,280
um and this purchased the screen went to

226
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,039
the bloke in the

227
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,560
scrap yard and said can i have the wires

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,039
with it because um i don't have them in

229
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,400
the car i'm putting it in and they're

230
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,360
like well

231
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
if you're not putting it in the original

232
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
car i'll give you the wires but you've

233
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
not got no warranty

234
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,279
so um basically there you go

235
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,958
there's head unit for about 300 quid

236
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,519
um but however if you just plug a head

237
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,920
unit into 12 volts these days

238
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,519
most of them don't even have buttons on

239
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,920
to turn it on and you don't get anything

240
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,959
out of it

241
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,120
what you need to do is purchase most of

242
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,680
those things on the floor there

243
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,560
had to purchase the ignition key initial

244
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,519
barrel

245
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,519
body control module engine ecu because

246
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,279
they're all coated together

247
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,040
steering switches they can come off any

248
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,600
vehicle instrument crusts again can come

249
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,959
off any vehicle

250
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,200
and the wiring room and get myself a 12

251
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
volt-ish power supply

252
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
plug it all in managed to get the head

253
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,200
unit working outside of the car

254
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,160
however that's not really portable so

255
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
what i did was do a bit of reverse

256
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,399
engineering um using um

257
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,600
some can bus software can utils

258
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
on a raspberry pi kicked up the canvas

259
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
listened to the messages coming through

260
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,839
worked out there was five messages

261
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,360
required

262
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,399
to um

263
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,480
basically start the head unit up without

264
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,240
the rest of the car being there

265
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,959
so i made myself this in little bottom

266
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,839
left-hand corner there's a little blue

267
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
box um which has an arduino nano and a

268
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,279
can transceiver um that then generates

269
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
those five messages so you can run the

270
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
head unit outside the car

271
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,000
in the case that is shown there um

272
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
when i actually got the head unit

273
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,360
working even though it said wi-fi on the

274
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,120
outside of the head unit

275
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,279
somewhat uh the wi-fi had already been

276
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,959
disabled but the bluetooth

277
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,640
um personal error network's still

278
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
available um

279
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,519
i've recently managed to find a russian

280
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,320
website

281
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
that tells you how to re-enable your

282
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,399
wi-fi as you can see there there's a

283
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,560
bluetooth symbol for bluetooth terrain

284
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
wi-fi symbol for wi-fi covering that's

285
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,839
quite handy

286
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,240
it's much easier to actually do the

287
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,519
attack via wi-fi

288
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
that is via bluetooth because bluetooth

289
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,720
just takes so long to do enable

290
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,640
the only saving grace on the head unit

291
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,839
regarding the exploit

292
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,959
is that it isn't automatically enabled

293
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,560
every time you get in the vehicle

294
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
you have to manually go in and turn on

295
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,160
either bluetooth tethering or wi-fi

296
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,360
television

297
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
um so at this point i was probably in it

298
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,040
for about

299
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,360
500 pounds so the head unit and the

300
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,160
wiring loom and

301
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,279
the other other pitch you saw previously

302
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,839
i parked it for a bit uh because i had

303
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
defcon and things to go to

304
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,880
uh however i wanted to make a um karna

305
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,680
bench

306
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
the inspiration for my car on the bench

307
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,959
is here

308
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,800
this is grim cybers um 3po

309
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,399
which has all the ecu's from a 2012 ford

310
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,120
focus

311
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,720
in the us it's probably identical to the

312
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
2012 focus in the uk but the steering

313
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,760
wheel's on the wrong side

314
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,240
but whatever however this doesn't

315
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
actually think it's a fully working car

316
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
it has all these to use you can play

317
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,279
with the data going around

318
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
you can make it do things by injecting

319
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,519
data as as you wish

320
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,440
however um it doesn't actually think

321
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
it's a working car

322
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,240
so um at the time i then went off to the

323
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,279
bug bash

324
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
me and a couple of other people found a

325
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,720
major vulnerability in the vehicle we

326
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,639
were testing

327
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,399
um we then got a payout of a five

328
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
share of payout of a five figure some

329
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
between the three of us

330
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,959
um which gave me a bit of spare cash to

331
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,720
actually build the rest of my car on the

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
box

333
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,600
or in this case car on the floor so i

334
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
had to then purchase

335
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,920
all these other extra bits um

336
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,399
so on the left you've got steering rack

337
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,160
um with its associated ecu

338
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
throttle body main fuse box which also

339
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,279
has an ecu in it

340
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,560
engine ecu already had abs ecu for the

341
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,279
brakes

342
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,360
throttle pedal because it's an

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
electronic throttle plate all uh body

344
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,959
control model i already had

345
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,320
there were some other switches and

346
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
things that i need to purchase to get

347
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,079
the lights and stuff working

348
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,720
some of the lights um switch cluster

349
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,360
already had

350
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
instrument cluster yes already had i

351
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
also had to buy all the sensors

352
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
and all the electronic components that

353
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,440
are attached to the engine

354
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,600
apart from the big things like

355
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
alternator and

356
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,440
start motor because they're just motors

357
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
and they're triggered by three wires

358
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
don't really need to emulate one of them

359
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
um

360
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,120
but so at that point i then had a car on

361
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,760
the floor

362
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,480
which is a bit messy and yeah great it's

363
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,920
not the easiest thing to get out

364
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
set up and play around with so i then

365
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
had to

366
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,279
see if i could get rid of some of this

367
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,800
wiring

368
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,839
onto wiring looms um so this is the

369
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,160
wiring diagram for my kick guards ecu

370
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,320
it's a mega squirt 3.0 it has a db37

371
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,800
of which 26 wires are connected i

372
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,839
believe

373
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,079
six of those of which are ground it's

374
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,360
not the

375
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
most complex engine in the world it uses

376
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,360
batch injection

377
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,560
wasted spark ignition

378
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,518
single fuel pump

379
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
crank sensor throttle position sensor

380
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,399
heat single oxygen sensor

381
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,839
coolant temperature and intake

382
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,920
temperature and that's quite a bit of

383
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
uh wiring especially when you have to

384
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
build it from scratch

385
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,279
however on the peugeot 208 that i had

386
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,240
um there's the wire wiring diagram for

387
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,120
the

388
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,839
main engine ecu in the middle and the

389
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,000
associated parts are actually

390
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,279
needed to make that work um the main

391
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,000
engine ecu has two 53-way connectors one

392
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
goes off to the engine compartment

393
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,680
one goes off back to the body and

394
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
there's another 32-way connector which

395
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,800
also goes off the body

396
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,000
so that's 138 possible pins that could

397
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,199
actually be used

398
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,440
um quite a few of them are most of them

399
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,480
are actually

400
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
um this is because the engine in

401
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
question is a cylinder with sequential

402
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,959
injection

403
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,120
coil on plug dual o2 sensor dual

404
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,079
variable time

405
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,040
valve timing including dual cam sensors

406
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,360
it

407
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
also had um

408
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
air temperature whatever manifold air

409
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
pressure sensor electronic throttle

410
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,360
body and electronic pedal

411
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
this is just the single wiring diagram

412
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,880
for that one function every wiring

413
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,240
diagram for every function

414
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
is different there is no wiring diagram

415
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,279
that says

416
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,120
here is everything on that vehicle it's

417
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
an absolute pain

418
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,720
um when you're trying to build something

419
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,959
with all the bits of the wiring diagram

420
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,920
but

421
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
so we've got the engine ecu wired up but

422
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,440
we need to make the engine think it's

423
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
actually rotating

424
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,480
so what you need to do is you need to

425
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,079
spoof the crank and cam signals

426
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
um the way you do that

427
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,800
is the crank sensor on this

428
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,079
particular petrol engine um uses what

429
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,480
they call 60-1

430
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,959
pattern in which there's 59 holes

431
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,560
drilled in the back of the flywheel

432
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,440
there is a magnetic sensor pointing at

433
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
it and as as the 59 holes go around it

434
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,560
makes a waveform and the 60th hole is a

435
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,320
space that it knows where it is

436
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
and that can give its waveform for

437
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,040
the um crankshaft the camshafts

438
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,000
themselves

439
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
there are two camshafts in this vehicle

440
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,639
both have variable valve timing

441
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,360
um the cat one of the camp sensors is

442
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,759
here

443
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,560
the other cam center is over here and

444
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,519
there is a

445
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,759
profile on the end that also again has a

446
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,959
sensor pointed at it

447
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,040
and creates a waveform just so that the

448
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
engine knows where it is in the

449
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,639
um cycle depending on where it's put

450
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,759
the where it wants to put the variable

451
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,120
valve timing

452
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
so i had to find a bit of hardware and

453
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,839
or software that could do this

454
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,000
arduino comes to rescue a bit of

455
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
software called argustim

456
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,040
here is a trace from a

457
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
protocol analyzer top row

458
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
is the crank sensor first second row

459
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,440
is the inlet sensor and the third one is

460
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,800
the exhaust sensor

461
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
as you can see the crank sensor it

462
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,440
repeats twice for every one turn of the

463
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,320
cam

464
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,399
that's because it's a four-stroke engine

465
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,079
and you've got the suck squeeze pan

466
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,600
below

467
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,000
down in the bottom corner is a pcb i had

468
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
built

469
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,959
after i'd originally built it just so

470
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,639
that if anyone else wants to try and

471
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,040
build

472
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,600
a car in a box they can then generate

473
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
these signals quite easily

474
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,119
um there is space on that pcb for both

475
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,199
surface mount and through-hole versions

476
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,240
of the transistors

477
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,119
and resistors there's also a third spot

478
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,119
for one of the transistors to be a very

479
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,160
large one for slightly heavier

480
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,919
duty um slightly heavier duty

481
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,520
transistor load

482
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,799
so that was the cranking cam sensor

483
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,559
sorted

484
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,160
some of the other sensors on the vehicle

485
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
you can get away with just a

486
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,480
potentiometer

487
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
fuel gauge being one water temperature

488
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
being another

489
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,280
you can also use something to create a

490
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,440
vacuum on the manifold air pressure

491
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,960
sensor i tried to use a

492
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
syringe a large syringe attached to a

493
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
pipe it doesn't always work

494
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,600
but most of the time it gives you enough

495
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
of an it will

496
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
actually fall center enough to think

497
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
it's doing it

498
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,880
um there are some other things you need

499
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
to for when building a car in a box

500
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,640
um things like indicators you have to

501
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
have the correct load

502
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
for the indicators otherwise they'll

503
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,720
flash fast

504
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,039
onto the next sensor that was had to be

505
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,120
simulated in some way shape or form

506
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,600
um most cars nowadays have lambda

507
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,799
sensors

508
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,200
which are used to to check how the

509
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,000
fuel is burnt within the engine um

510
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
there's one pre

511
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
and post the catalytic converter they

512
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,919
basically create

513
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,360
a ac waveform on a dc offset

514
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
which basically says i'm going lean i'm

515
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,559
going rich i'm going to lean i'm going

516
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,360
rich

517
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,320
this is the circuit it uses a 555 timer

518
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,280
and those

519
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,840
values of um visitors and batteries as

520
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,799
shown

521
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,720
there are two of these inside my car in

522
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,880
the box one for the pre-cat one for the

523
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,559
post cap

524
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,799
the lambda sensor also has a separate

525
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,080
part that you also need

526
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,559
for in that there are heater circuits

527
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,559
within the sensors

528
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,840
they draw about an er one amp all the

529
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,720
time

530
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,840
so you need a um suitably sized and

531
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,440
high wattage resistor to be able to

532
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,400
fall the lambda heater sensor and the

533
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,840
sensor heater even

534
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,760
to think the vehicle is working

535
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,640
otherwise you'll throw an error message

536
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
the last of the sensors that was an

537
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
absolute pain to fool

538
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,120
i originally tried to do it

539
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,600
electronically by trying to monitor the

540
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,960
waveform

541
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,000
when spinning

542
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,679
the disc in front of a

543
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,880
sensor using a drill wasn't fast enough

544
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,679
and i couldn't work it out but what i

545
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,360
have done here is there is a motor in

546
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,160
the middle there

547
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,400
attached to a disc around that disc is

548
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,160
the reluctor wheel which would normally

549
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,960
be on your

550
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,919
um axle on the vehicle and there are

551
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,440
four sensors around that um

552
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,679
relaxed wheel one for each of the four

553
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,840
corners of the car

554
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,400
that then tells the abs ecu that your

555
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,159
wheels are rotating

556
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,559
what you need to then do is pulse using

557
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,000
that arduino nano

558
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,120
and here and the

559
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,120
rg stim with a larger transistor

560
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,760
you can then possibly modulate that

561
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,919
motor to speed up or slow down depending

562
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,320
on

563
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
where how fast or slow you want the

564
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
engine to think it's uh

565
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,320
this wheels to think it's going around

566
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
um that was a challenge but it's now

567
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,720
working

568
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,840
works quite well doesn't fail

569
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,600
too often sometimes it ends up going 170

570
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,120
odd mile an hour which is just a bit

571
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,480
weird but

572
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,320
oops whatever onto the car in the box

573
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,039
itself

574
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,919
um there are here is a map of the can

575
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,240
networks inside the car

576
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,600
and there are four canvases and the red

577
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
and orange one on the left hand side is

578
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
what you would call your main canvas

579
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
the one you can actually normally access

580
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,240
in the vehicle

581
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,559
there is your obd2 port on the bottom

582
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,520
left-hand corner

583
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,000
that bus then goes to the body control

584
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,960
module

585
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,159
the abs esp ecu power steering engine

586
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:12,880
ecu

587
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,600
and the main fuel fuse box that is a

588
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,000
high speed

589
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,640
bus at 500k there are two other low

590
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
speed buses at 125k

591
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,799
there's the yellow and green one which

592
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,320
goes from the body control module

593
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,720
which acts as a gateway to the steering

594
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,760
control ecu

595
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,039
so the one where all your switches for

596
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,400
your lights and the indicators and

597
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,360
things

598
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,520
the airbag ecu which i haven't put in

599
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
the car in a box because i really don't

600
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,280
want someone to try and set an airbag

601
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,159
off

602
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,080
at a conference and me having to fill a

603
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,200
form in

604
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,520
and then again there is an additional

605
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,720
obd2 port on that bus

606
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
so you can see what's going on on the

607
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,480
bus or inject messages if you want to

608
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,960
make it do something nefarious

609
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,440
the second blue and darker blue

610
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,280
low speed bus comes from the body

611
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,480
control module

612
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,880
and is for the instrument cluster and

613
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,640
the matrix within the instrument cluster

614
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,440
which gives you

615
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,640
gps commands on things and the ivi

616
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,360
again i've got an additional obd2 port

617
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,159
on this

618
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,720
bus too for reasons for

619
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,919
monitoring and or injecting data finally

620
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,559
there is a

621
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,679
fourth bus which is a high speed bus

622
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,440
between the ivi screen

623
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,400
and the head unit itself which i believe

624
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,159
is for the touch panel

625
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,200
so you can see what's going on

626
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,320
if it works might as well

627
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,159
so what does the car in the box look

628
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,000
like my current box is called

629
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
pdo p for peugeot d0 is 208

630
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,600
in hex which is what the vehicle has

631
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,280
come from

632
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,559
there is the main box at the bottom

633
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,520
there the box in the middle at the top

634
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,480
is a record box for 12 inch records

635
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
which is where the um

636
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
abs simulator is and then there is the

637
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,960
case for the iv in the box

638
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,200
um this all sort of fits in the back of

639
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,120
my car quite well

640
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,799
um i used to take up the whole boot and

641
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,799
all the back seat on my previous vehicle

642
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
not fun when going to a conference and

643
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,159
you have to try and stick around and

644
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,039
leave your car

645
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,360
exposed but yes

646
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
some of you are probably wondering how

647
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,919
much this has actually cost me to build

648
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,840
the ibi in a box was probably

649
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,120
a total of about 500 pound the rest of

650
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
the components probably cost me about

651
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
another 1500 pounds that's probably

652
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,360
about

653
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,720
2 grand in it um i could have probably

654
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,559
done it a bit cheaper by buying a whole

655
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,520
car

656
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,200
and then stripping everything out and

657
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
then selling the bits i didn't want

658
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,159
but that's just grief and don't really

659
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,400
have anywhere to store the other bits

660
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,640
um but yeah two thousand pounds that was

661
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,440
all paid for

662
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,320
thanks to the finding that we had on the

663
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
vehicle at the bug bash

664
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,840
so here again are the pictures of the

665
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,440
abs sensor simulator and the head unit

666
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,799
in a box

667
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,000
here is um a picture of my car in the

668
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
box

669
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,559
as you can see um the control

670
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,919
most of the control parts on the right

671
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,360
hand side so you've got the steering

672
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,320
switches

673
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,480
your dashboard switches your ignition

674
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,840
key instrument cluster

675
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
there's also the washer bottle attached

676
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,200
there

677
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
message me afterwards i'll tell you a

678
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,120
story about that one

679
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,559
on the left-hand side you've got all the

680
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,600
engine components so the engine ecu

681
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,760
audio stim on the left there you've got

682
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,679
um variable resistor for the water

683
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,320
water temperature the o2 simulator at

684
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,039
the top

685
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,320
pedals throttle body etc

686
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,240
there's also a board that allows you to

687
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,320
see what lights are going on

688
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,000
uh under that board are the very large

689
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,159
resistors for the um

690
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,400
indicators so you can they flash

691
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
correctly

692
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,679
so they don't flash fast um

693
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,799
so that is it in its um

694
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,919
exposed form so we think so

695
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,400
here here's a little video of my car in

696
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,840
the box

697
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,320
so that's argue stim burying the rev

698
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,919
counter

699
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,360
and it's currently doing about 2 000 rpm

700
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,760
and now i'm going to turn on the abs

701
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,039
simulator

702
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,679
and vary the speed you can hear the

703
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,039
motor going

704
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,679
it's currently doing 100

705
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,480
143 mile an hour

706
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,039
i'd like to like to see you do 143 mile

707
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,720
an hour and a purge of toy it probably

708
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,799
um shake itself to bits

709
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,919
there you go it's gone back down to

710
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,320
nothing

711
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,240
that is just an example of what you can

712
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,159
do you can also do

713
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,400
can injection and make those things do

714
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,159
itself

715
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,440
so um here is a little thing i produced

716
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
when i first started the car hiking

717
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
village in the uk

718
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,840
it's a nano can adapter i give out these

719
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,720
pcbs

720
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,760
as my business card this is last year's

721
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,400
one

722
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
so 2019 still got a load left anyone

723
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,279
wants one message me afterwards

724
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,360
i will send it to you if you cover the

725
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,880
postage

726
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,760
um what this allows you to do is build a

727
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,200
canvas adapter

728
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,000
for probably less than five dollars it

729
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,559
uses

730
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,760
a cheap arduino nano from china which is

731
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,880
a couple of dollars and a

732
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,919
mcp2515 can controller module

733
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,799
um again another couple of dollars from

734
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,360
china

735
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,279
it's easier if you buy the components

736
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,120
yourself

737
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,520
because getting one through customs is

738
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,240
quite easy

739
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,120
getting a box of 50 through customs

740
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,039
slightly harder i get them

741
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,720
charged for import tax etc

742
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,080
this in its default form if you load

743
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,919
them receive all sketch

744
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,240
shown here um you can use with the

745
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,279
arduino

746
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,880
ide on the serial console

747
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,279
and see all the messages going through

748
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,799
can bus

749
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,720
here is the same messages going through

750
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,159
putty

751
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,000
just use it as a 500k serial port

752
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,279
the github repository is there there are

753
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,399
some other ones for

754
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,320
other microcontrollers as well tnt the

755
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,320
sp32

756
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,720
but if anyone does want one give me a

757
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,000
shout

758
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,320
um here is another video of

759
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,200
what i call disco mode one of my little

760
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,960
um can adapters is programmed

761
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,559
to um randomly generate messages

762
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,840
for the light switch module um which

763
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,679
then basically calls it go

764
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,720
cause it to go into an epileptic fit and

765
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,679
do the flashy lights for you uh it's

766
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,880
quite interesting

767
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,000
um a friend of mine has a peugeot 208

768
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and we were going to put it in his car

769
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,159
so when he got to a certain speed

770
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,720
um the lights would go mental and he'd

771
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
get worried but he wouldn't let us

772
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,240
so yeah swell sport um

773
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,799
so it's amazing what you can do by just

774
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,240
injecting messages

775
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,880
but don't play with your own car unless

776
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
you know what you're doing

777
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,320
that is why i have the car in the box

778
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
that is why i bring it to conferences

779
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,279
because if you it's if you break this

780
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,039
it's not going to kill someone i can

781
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,039
just replace one part might cost me

782
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,039
a small amount of money but not

783
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,039
excessive amount of money

784
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,840
um but that is me done i'd like to say

785
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,559
thank you

786
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,799
a to the grim cyber team for their

787
