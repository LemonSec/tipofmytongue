00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,279
hey hackers

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,960
thank you for a wonderful day of

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,320
disclosure learning

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,360
and community it's days like these that

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,200
give me a reason to celebrate everyone

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
who has decided to join us on this

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,279
journey

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,920
hackers co-workers customers investors

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,640
and partners

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,080
and how far we've truly come together

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,760
many of you know me but for those who

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519
don't i'm yoburt atma one of the

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,640
co-founders of hackerone we started out

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,399
as a couple hackers in the netherlands

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,480
with this crazy belief that people like

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:34,800
us

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
could make organizations safer and do it

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
more efficiently and cost effectively

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,520
than traditional approaches

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
after hearing from you all today and

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,120
getting to know just a handful of the

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,000
more than 10

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,039
000 registrants for today maybe this

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,760
idea isn't so crazy after all

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
when my co-founders and i first set out

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,760
on this journey we had a vision

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,000
a vision of a future where vulnerability

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,160
disclosure will be ubiquitous and where

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,520
hackers become essential

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,119
for all who build and deploy software

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
from william bowling we saw evidence of

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,560
the immense value

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
hackers provide to organizations and

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,080
from justin gardner

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,159
we saw how creative perspectives can

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,360
escalate the severity of a vulnerability

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,280
we also envision cyber security becoming

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,759
more collaborative

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,759
security through obscurity is the last

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,080
vestige of a failed industry

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,119
working in a silo is destined to fail

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,520
we all face an asymmetric threat and the

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,880
most trusted companies

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
understand that this fight cannot be won

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,200
alone

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
over time we've seen hackers and

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,799
security teams running bug bounty

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
programs were forming bonds that

50
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,880
transcended a single report

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,640
we've seen security teams realize that

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,560
hackers are an extension of their own

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,399
team

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,560
from heath adams we heard stories of his

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,320
favorite findings and how he turns us

56
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,479
into educational content for others to

57
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,079
learn

58
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,240
the concept that secrecy and security go

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,200
hand in hand

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
is falling apart and so finally we

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,640
envision transparency breeding trust

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
and you all today have helped deliver on

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,239
this

64
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,239
thanks to talks from folks like georgia

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,000
whiteman and jason haddocks and the

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
stories of insider phd

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,040
yura zebu swordfish and alyssa herrera

68
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,640
on the panel we've been able to

69
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,879
collaborate across time zones and

70
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,840
cultures

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,720
sharing insights tools and techniques to

72
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,280
make

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,920
us all better hackers it means

74
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,959
everything to me

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,879
that our promise of transparency has

76
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,720
helped promote a culture of knowledge

77
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,519
sharing and community

78
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,280
as a community of hackers we are

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,879
breaking the mold of traditional

80
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,040
secrecy-based security in the spirit of

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,599
learning

82
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,800
openness and collaboration

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
earlier today in the opening address

84
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,800
martin mentioned a few predictions of

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,319
his own

86
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,879
this year you crossed over 100 million

87
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,599
dollars

88
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,840
in bounties earned he predicted you'll

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
earn one billion dollars in bug bounties

90
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,560
within the next five years

91
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,879
within the next 15 years he predicted

92
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,360
500 csos will come out of our hacker

93
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,640
ranks

94
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,720
i can't wait to see you all blow this

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
out of the water

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
if what we saw here today is any

97
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
evidence then together

98
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:25,760
we will hit harder happy hacking
