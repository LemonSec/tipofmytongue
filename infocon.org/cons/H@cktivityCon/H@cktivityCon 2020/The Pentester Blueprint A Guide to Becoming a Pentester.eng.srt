00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,279
hello and thank you thank you for

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,280
joining my talk the pentester blueprint

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,240
a guide to

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,280
becoming a pen tester

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,960
for those of you that know me i'm philip

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,199
wiley i'm a red team

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,039
lead for a global consumer products

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,880
company the adjunct professor

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,920
at richland college now dallas college

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
and i'm also the phone school project

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,039
founder

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,800
i created the poneschool project as a

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,720
way for my students to continue their

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,640
education

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,160
my very first semester a lot of students

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,680
were finishing up class

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,040
and they were wanting to know what to go

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,440
do from here and also had some other

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,559
people in the community

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,920
wanting education and defensive security

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
practices so i started the home school

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
project as a way to

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,120
extend education so on my my this slide

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,239
you see

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,199
my career broken down so i've been in

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,800
iot and infosec for

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
over 22 years uh spent six

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,879
my first six years as a system

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,000
administrator

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,159
16 plus years total in network security

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,680
knapsack

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
this is including the pen test career

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,960
out of that eight and a half years i

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,600
spent

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,040
as a pen tester in the first first

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,920
five years as a consultant i break this

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,280
down because if you're wanting to become

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
a pen tester you kind of see what i did

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,080
to get in

41
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,320
into it and i'm also the co-host of the

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,720
podcast the uncommon common journey

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,119
hosted on itsp magazine with chloe

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:29,840
mustaghi

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,520
and alissa miller so kind of go back

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,040
even further in my career before i even

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
got into

48
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,720
it when i graduated high school i didn't

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,280
know what i wanted to do for a living so

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
friends recommended me being a pro

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,399
wrestler so i did pro wrestling for a

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,600
couple years

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,000
had to get a job to support uh

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,240
my family so i didn't have you know

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
skills to that would really provide for

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,320
that

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,159
so pro wrestling i wasn't getting being

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,680
able to wrestle enough and it's not

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,320
a lifestyle conducive to to family so i

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,079
went to trade school to be an autocad

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,439
draftsman

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,439
and during my autocad career i found out

63
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,038
about system administration

64
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,959
seemed a lot more interesting to me than

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,200
than autocad so i made the switch to

66
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,760
system administration and eventually

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,959
moved into infosec

68
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,280
spending the first part of my first year

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,640
and a half

70
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,120
doing uh network security and then moved

71
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,080
into appsec

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,520
is where i found out about penetration

73
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
testing and then moved into penetration

74
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,840
testing

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
so each semester i share the slide my

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,959
students with great power comes great

77
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,319
responsibility

78
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,080
only hack if you have permission to hack

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
and even better with written permission

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
hacking without permission is illegal so

81
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
make sure if you're going to do any kind

82
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
of hacking

83
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
pin testing make sure it's in your home

84
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,480
lab

85
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,319
or either through bug bounties bug

86
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,480
bounties are a great way to get

87
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
experience in live production

88
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,680
environments this is

89
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
experience that you can use on your

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
interviews you can

91
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
explain how you were able to find

92
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
certain vulnerabilities and how you're

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,599
able to exploit them

94
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,360
and explain that during during the

95
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,120
interview process so this is a

96
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,519
great place to learn and get experience

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,840
so what is pen testing so pen testing is

98
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,959
uh

99
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,040
assessing security from an adversary's

100
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
perspective

101
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
kind of assessing things the way a cyber

102
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,760
criminal would

103
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,120
and so that's in you know in hopes of

104
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,519
discovering what a malicious actor might

105
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,840
find to be able to to remediate those

106
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,640
and protest

107
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,798
protect against those vulnerabilities

108
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,200
and white pen testing if you understand

109
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,879
the adversarial perspective

110
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,440
of your security posture then you're

111
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,400
able to

112
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,159
better protect it you're able to better

113
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,720
justify uh remediation sometimes

114
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,480
remediation is more than just making a

115
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,840
configuration change

116
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,760
sometimes remediation could be mean

117
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,319
adding a web application firewall

118
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,439
to your network it could entail a

119
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
firewall in general endpoint protection

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
other types of devices

121
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
that could be costly so if you have a

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,560
pen test

123
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
and vulnerabilities that prove that that

124
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,680
need to be

125
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
remediated then that's a way to justify

126
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,799
the cost

127
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,959
and even better yet if you're able to

128
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
exploit those vulnerabilities

129
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,279
it shows you know a higher need to get

130
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,040
that remediated as well as justifying

131
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,519
the budget

132
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,320
and also uh pen testing is very popular

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,600
due to compliance regulatory compliance

134
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
especially psi dss payment card industry

135
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
data security standard a lot of jobs

136
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
popped up from that

137
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
whenever i was getting started in pen

138
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,360
testing it was mainly consultants

139
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
and contractors back in 2012

140
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,240
and now due to pci and companies

141
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,919
that are processing a certain number of

142
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,000
credit cards have to go through pci

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
then they have to go they have to be pci

144
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,919
compliant so this brought about the need

145
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,680
for a lot more pen testing

146
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
and companies couldn't afford to pay pen

147
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,800
testers you know

148
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
contract-wise or consulting to do all

149
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,120
these tests so it made more sense to

150
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
bring this in-house that way they could

151
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
get pen tests done quicker

152
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,560
and even from that on you know even bug

153
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,520
bounties to

154
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,800
help assist in that other reasons

155
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
for pen testing it's a fun job and

156
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,400
there's a lot of career opportunities i

157
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,759
mean this is one of the areas

158
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,600
one of the areas that's not totally new

159
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
but it's gained popularity and a lot

160
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,039
more companies are realizing the need

161
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,280
for pen testers

162
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,000
pen testing jobs uh formerly it's

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
penetration testing

164
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,320
more commonly you know most more common

165
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,080
term is pentester

166
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,160
security consultants analyst engineers

167
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
are usually the the roles that

168
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,360
these positions fill there may not be a

169
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,840
it

170
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,120
a hr description as ethical hacker or

171
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,080
pen tester

172
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,240
but those are typical some of the hr

173
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,080
roles some other synonymous terms

174
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,479
ethical hacker offensive security

175
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,240
uh adversarial security threat and

176
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
vulnerability management threatened

177
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
vulnerability management is a very

178
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,960
popular

179
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,199
department that pen testers usually fall

180
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,560
under

181
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
so when you're looking for a job then

182
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
you you may look may need to look at the

183
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
descriptions because it could be a

184
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,199
security analyst

185
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,919
or a security engineer and you just have

186
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,199
to look at the description to see the

187
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,479
type of tools and duties you're

188
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,919
performing to see that it's a pen

189
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,360
testing job

190
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,440
pen testing is is uh valuable in other

191
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,520
areas sock analysts

192
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
uh digital forensics incident response

193
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,759
network security engineers

194
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,160
uh purple teams this is where the

195
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
offensive security works with the

196
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,120
defenders to be able to

197
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,160
to detect the the activities and block

198
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,199
those and be able to respond to those uh

199
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:41,600
also

200
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
application security where a lot of you

201
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,720
that are viewing

202
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,919
today you're you're either a bug hunter

203
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,599
you're into bug bounties or you're just

204
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,800
wanting or you're someone that's wanting

205
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,240
to get into it

206
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,080
so the skills you build through bug

207
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
bounty and application security kind of

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,319
go hand in hand

209
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
so understanding the malicious traffic

210
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
as a sock analyst

211
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,240
is very important security analyst and

212
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,319
engineers understanding that traffic is

213
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,400
also good and then digital forensics and

214
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,080
instant response if you understand the

215
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,919
attacks then it's going to make

216
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,880
you know it's going to give you some

217
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,800
insight into your investigations that

218
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
you may not otherwise have

219
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,639
different types of pen test targets so

220
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
network application

221
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
hardware transportation your different

222
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,960
vehicles

223
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,400
autonomous driving vehicles are very

224
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,160
important to you to be secure so we need

225
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,199
to test those

226
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,599
uh people in buildings be able to test

227
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
the security of buildings

228
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,639
as well as the people that are employees

229
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,039
of the

230
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,960
of the company they they're go they got

231
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,479
badges they go to the building

232
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,879
people can tailgate behind them so those

233
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,319
need to be tested you can have the most

234
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,360
secure network

235
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,520
most secure applications but if someone

236
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,560
can get past

237
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,039
security into the building into the data

238
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
center then it's gonna be a lot easier

239
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,360
for them to

240
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,160
to breach a system so it's important to

241
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,199
test those

242
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,840
and then your hardware devices your your

243
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
routers and switches even your soho

244
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,400
routers

245
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,560
and switches as well as internet of

246
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,039
things and medical devices

247
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,960
it's interesting because during my

248
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,720
consulting career i did some pin testing

249
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,440
of

250
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,680
some hospitals and you could see like

251
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,039
during wireless pen tests you could see

252
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,319
medical devices like

253
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,319
insulin pumps and different life support

254
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:22,960
devices

255
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
connected to the network so those need

256
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
to be secure and need to be tested

257
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
and this is where pen testers come into

258
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080
play be able to think like the bad guy

259
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
to be able to find those

260
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,958
vulnerabilities and protect against it

261
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,599
different types of pen test knowledge so

262
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
traditionally you hear of a black box

263
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,760
pen test

264
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,559
white box in gray box your black box is

265
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,519
going to be more

266
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,279
similar to what an adversary would

267
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,120
attack so you're seeing more of what a

268
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
real world attack would be like

269
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680
so this is very limited information

270
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,040
maybe an ip address

271
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,800
maybe urls i did a black box pen test

272
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
more of a full scope pen test back in

273
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
2008 and

274
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,600
all we had for the client we knew the

275
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,920
name of the client we knew the address

276
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,320
because we

277
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,920
we need to test physical security and be

278
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,839
able to get there to do internal network

279
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,839
pen testing

280
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,160
so we were able to do recon and i was

281
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,000
able to find information on the company

282
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,519
through like showdown

283
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,120
that uh was not we weren't able to find

284
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,600
devices in the network blocks so that

285
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
limited information we were able to

286
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,800
find ip addresses to test and then we

287
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,560
actually came on site

288
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
got into the building unauthorized into

289
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
the the office of the

290
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,880
cons the client and was able to test in

291
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,320
one of their conference rooms

292
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
so this was we had limited information

293
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
so with this type of testing it takes

294
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
more time to collect information

295
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,839
now the opposite end of the spectrum is

296
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,000
your white box or crystal box testing

297
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
and this is very common in your web app

298
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
pen testing and really a needed

299
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,480
uh type of test level because that way

300
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
you've got more information you can more

301
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
thoroughly test the system

302
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
so with this you typically special in

303
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,680
application you have accounts

304
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,640
sometimes diagrams prior to the kickoff

305
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
of the pentest you will work with

306
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
the developers to get a walk through the

307
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,160
application to understand how the

308
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,680
application works to be able to more

309
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,040
thoroughly test it

310
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
and graybox is some as kind of partial

311
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,720
knowledge it's limited amount of

312
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,519
ip address the ip addresses you

313
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,480
basically don't get

314
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
your accounts and that sort of stuff but

315
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
you have

316
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,079
the ips that are in scope and then it's

317
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:26,880
up to you to test

318
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
this is what you more commonly see like

319
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
on your network pen test just to

320
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
you know just the scope items to test

321
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,959
without more information than that

322
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,720
and like going back to say these are all

323
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,279
based on time the more time you have

324
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,279
then the less information you need you

325
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
you need for the test

326
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,040
and the more time then you've got

327
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
you know you can perform the black box

328
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
type testing

329
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
and and with more limited time you need

330
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,920
more information to build thoroughly

331
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,640
test it

332
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,399
and definitely on web application you

333
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,519
really want to test that because you

334
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,160
need to test all levels

335
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
of access administrator just regular

336
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,240
users of the system to make sure you

337
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,839
can't elevate your privileges

338
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,440
and even administrators don't need to be

339
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,120
able to see account information or

340
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,320
social security numbers

341
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,640
so be able to test and make sure certain

342
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
data can't be accessed

343
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,399
and certain levels of privilege can be

344
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,279
escalated too

345
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
and so different types these are

346
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,680
actually testing depth they're actually

347
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,120
different steps some of these are part

348
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
of a pentest but as you notice

349
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,680
the items that says in red not a pen

350
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,800
test

351
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
these first two items although they're

352
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
included as steps in a pen test

353
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
they're not a pen test vulnerability

354
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,240
scanning is just running nessus or

355
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,360
nexpose

356
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,279
or running the vulnerability scanner

357
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,200
within burp suite you're looking for

358
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,279
vulnerabilities this is a way as a pen

359
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
tester to pick those vulnerabilities up

360
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
quickly and spend your time on more

361
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
important stuff but also

362
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,639
vulnerability scans are routinely done

363
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,079
by

364
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,839
a group within organizations that do

365
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,839
just vulnerability scanning

366
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,760
and so you do is they run the scans

367
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,959
periodically

368
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,680
you know every two weeks to a month

369
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,360
maybe even weekly if you

370
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
have the bandwidth to be able to test

371
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,399
that many systems

372
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,000
and you're able to find the low hanging

373
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
fruit and get those remediated

374
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,440
but in a pen test this would be like one

375
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
of the first steps you do in a pen test

376
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,519
so vulnerability assessments is the next

377
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,760
level after your

378
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,600
your vulnerability scam on your

379
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,040
vulnerability assessment

380
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,000
you're going through and looking at

381
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,959
those vulnerabilities and you're

382
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,399
validating them to make sure they're not

383
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,440
false positives

384
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
sometimes your vulnerability scanners

385
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,639
are going to find false positives so you

386
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
want to make sure you rule those out

387
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
and you can also run other other tools

388
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,160
do more manual testing during the

389
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
vulnerability assessment phase this is

390
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,839
still my pen test but this is just a

391
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,279
vulnerability assessment sometimes

392
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,639
clients will request

393
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,000
a vulnerability assessment they don't

394
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
want you to do a pen test because they

395
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,440
don't want you to exploit the systems

396
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
because they're worried about

397
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,839
taking the systems down making them

398
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,320
unavailable and

399
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,399
uh so this is kind of to lighten the

400
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,000
risk i've done web app

401
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,240
actually wireless pen tests before of

402
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,279
hospitals

403
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
and the concern by the cso was that

404
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
they're worried that something would get

405
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,399
taken down so we

406
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,720
kind of revised what we were going to do

407
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,240
on the pen test and went to

408
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
an assessment so we're just running

409
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,839
vulnerability scans but not actually

410
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,720
going through

411
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
and trying to exploit the systems so the

412
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,880
next step

413
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
of this process after you've done your

414
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,800
vulnerability assessment

415
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
you validate your vulnerabilities found

416
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
anything manually or using other tools

417
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,399
then you come to the pen test phase the

418
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,079
pen test level this is

419
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,839
actually going through and exploiting

420
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,120
the vulnerabilities that you found

421
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,480
during the pen test

422
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,079
and once you exploit those you see if

423
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,839
you can escalate privileges

424
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,760
if you're able to to get lateral

425
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,199
movement take accounts and

426
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,760
and connect to other systems so that's

427
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,320
what

428
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
what you test during this process and

429
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,760
then you have like your red

430
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
red team and adversarial test this more

431
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
simulates a cyber

432
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
cyber criminal or a nation state you're

433
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,199
going in

434
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,000
and it's not the importance of finding

435
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
every single vulnerability it's just

436
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,839
finding how those can be exploited

437
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,120
to do serious uh

438
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,240
damage to the company as far as uh

439
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,600
collecting information or uh

440
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,839
actually gaining access to you know

441
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,440
possibly if it's a banking system you

442
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,920
know just

443
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
going through in this you're really

444
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,199
focused on

445
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,440
uh getting the important stuff not

446
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,399
wasting your stuff with

447
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,160
just just vulnerabilities you want to

448
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,240
focus on exploitable vulnerabilities

449
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,680
you're also wanting to during this

450
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,360
process test the blue team

451
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,880
see if they're seeing you on the network

452
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
see if they're responding

453
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,000
and so then after you wrap up this type

454
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
of engagement then you can work with

455
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
the blue team to show them corrective

456
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,360
measures because when this activity is

457
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
going on you want your defenders to be

458
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,920
detecting it

459
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
so this is one way to detect to actually

460
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,120
test the blue team

461
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
test the people processes and technology

462
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,320
and not just

463
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,480
test for vulnerabilities this has become

464
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,680
more popular

465
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,480
due to pci pen testing more narrowing

466
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,120
the scope

467
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,279
of pen tests and a lot of things getting

468
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,560
overlooked so this is

469
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,639
starting to become more popular you're

470
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,199
seeing more red team jobs out there

471
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
this is a very exciting and interesting

472
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,639
area if you're into more of the network

473
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,160
type pen testing although your web

474
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,839
application pin testing skills are very

475
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,600
important

476
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,800
sometimes the the network

477
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
be able to exploit the network as well

478
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
as active directory

479
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,720
very important in that phase of that

480
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
type of assessment

481
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,199
there are specializations you have your

482
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
generalists which just

483
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,279
do the basic type of pen testing and

484
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,279
cover a range of things

485
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,320
your wireless your network and your

486
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
application some light application and

487
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,920
then you have application

488
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
so this is web app mobile the client

489
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,360
cloud

490
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,199
and people that specialize in that area

491
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,040
sometimes come from development as far

492
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
and also like the

493
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,600
the generalists a lot of people like

494
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,279
myself that's where i started as a

495
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,320
journalist

496
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,560
and i got my start because my sysadmin

497
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,000
background understand networking and

498
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,279
operating systems

499
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,440
so this was easier for me to learn and

500
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
so your social engineering

501
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,639
testing the the buildings the you know

502
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,680
in

503
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,079
uh through the physical security this is

504
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,680
also a lot of times part of a red team

505
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,480
engagement

506
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
so those are very important skills and

507
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
then transportation specialization

508
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,360
they're people that are just dedicated

509
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,639
car hackers

510
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,240
so they they do that so you can

511
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
specialize in these or you can learn a

512
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,639
little bit

513
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,880
a little bit of all of it so if you the

514
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,480
nice thing about pen testing is if you

515
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,759
get bored in one area

516
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
you can learn other things during my

517
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,600
consulting career

518
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
i was fortunate enough to work for an

519
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
employer that allowed me to

520
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,480
to learn other types of pen testing when

521
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,560
i went to work for them i had never done

522
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
wi-fi pen tests but i got to do learn

523
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,399
how to do wi-fi pen tests so

524
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,480
there's a lot of different areas to work

525
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
in a lot of people like to specialize in

526
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,759
the hardware and iot stuff which is a

527
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,880
very important

528
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,160
and more newer part of pen testing

529
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,680
and a lot of skills are very

530
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,519
transferable to uh

531
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,720
security research and bug bounty so this

532
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,759
is the this is the

533
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,120
the part of the talk most people are

534
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,880
interested in how do i become a pen

535
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,759
tester

536
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,480
so to become a pen tester you need the

537
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,000
technological knowledge you need to

538
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,880
understand the talk

539
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,439
the technology before you can secure it

540
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,640
before you can

541
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,280
break into it so you need to understand

542
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
networking

543
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,199
and operating systems windows and linux

544
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,480
and you need to understand these at a

545
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,880
sys admin level if you get a shell to

546
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,240
the system you

547
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,480
and if you have the right privileges you

548
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,799
can shut down firewalls start and stop

549
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,240
services

550
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
do several other things so once you get

551
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,280
a shell

552
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
you need to understand that command line

553
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,000
otherwise you're going to spend a lot of

554
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,720
time googling

555
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
you're not going to and not effectively

556
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,520
spend your time on the pen test

557
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,600
then understanding security application

558
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,360
hardware is also important

559
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,960
knowing the security of how windows or

560
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
linux works

561
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,640
is a good advantage to be able to test

562
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
for misconfigurations and see how you

563
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
can possibly bypass those

564
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,439
and exploit the system

565
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,600
and so uh also once you have the

566
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
technology

567
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
part of that that foundation then you're

568
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,240
going to need to

569
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,720
the hacking experience so hacking

570
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
knowledge through classes

571
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,799
conferences and virtual conferences like

572
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,440
this meetings meetups

573
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,840
self-study through your home labs videos

574
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,200
tutorials

575
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,280
uh blogs and articles on twitter there's

576
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
a lot of good people out there that are

577
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,559
uh sharing some great information on

578
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,320
on twitch you know for their streaming

579
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
or on

580
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,280
or on youtube a lot of good information

581
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,360
out there in twitter

582
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,600
infosec twitter there's a lot of good

583
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
research security researchers and bug

584
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,320
hunters on twitter

585
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,000
and pen testers red teamers that you can

586
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,520
follow that you can pick up information

587
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,400
from

588
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,960
when i was getting started on security

589
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,320
prior to twitter

590
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,520
you know we would go to blogs and

591
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
articles to get our information

592
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,320
or magazines and now we have with the

593
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
luxury of the researchers when they

594
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
create a new tool it's out there quicker

595
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,360
we're able to get that information

596
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,799
sooner this way

597
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,880
and so to become a pen tester you also

598
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,440
need to develop the hacker mindset

599
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,760
and so the hacker mindset out of a lot

600
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,480
of other areas in security

601
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,200
is one of the areas that that really

602
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,000
requires more

603
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
creativity it's a a combination of

604
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,600
creativity

605
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
and analytical thinking it's kind of

606
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,360
similar to troubleshooting so if you

607
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,039
ever think about if you installed an

608
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,640
operating system you installed linux for

609
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,919
the first time

610
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,840
and everything went well then you go

611
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,360
back and install another time

612
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
and you have a problem with it then you

613
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,960
have to troubleshoot it's more difficult

614
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,200
but after you've installed something and

615
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,640
learn how to troubleshoot it

616
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
then you know what to do next if you run

617
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,240
into this problem and that's the same

618
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,760
thing with the hacker mindset

619
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,559
you find a vulnerability maybe it's like

620
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,160
an unrestricted upload

621
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,679
then you know that you can next you can

622
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,000
upload some type of uh

623
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,559
shell to that system and possibly get

624
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,400
you know command on access get a shell

625
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,760
to that system so

626
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,520
you're able to chain together those type

627
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,280
attacks and the more you practice

628
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,640
the more you're able to chain these

629
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
different types of vulnerabilities and

630
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,440
attacks together to

631
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,159
to be able to exploit a system so the

632
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,760
more time you do over and over again you

633
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,120
build up that base knowledge and you

634
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,600
just

635
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,720
come up and you see a certain

636
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,159
vulnerability you know i can do this

637
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,120
next

638
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,200
so and the best way to develop the

639
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,240
hacker mindset

640
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,960
is through repetition and hands-on

641
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,720
hacking experience spending your time in

642
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,440
your lab

643
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,919
ctfs and that sort of thing bug bounties

644
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,799
going through

645
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,000
and after you you'll see some

646
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,159
vulnerabilities that are very common

647
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,919
and then you know how to exploit those

648
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,000
so that way you just you know

649
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,919
constantly practicing this is the way

650
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,039
you develop that mindset

651
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,080
and the pentester blueprint formula is

652
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,799
technology

653
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,880
knowledge plus security knowledge plus

654
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,320
the hacker mindset

655
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
with these things combined you have

656
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,120
you'll have what it takes to be a

657
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
penetration tester

658
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,360
and where to start where do you start in

659
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
this journey

660
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,000
you need to develop a plan and do like a

661
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
gap analysis on

662
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,400
what you're missing so you go through

663
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
and look at the skills you have that are

664
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,799
needed

665
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
like your your networking operating

666
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
systems

667
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,080
you also look at like linux you know

668
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
linux is very important as a pen tester

669
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,520
there's a lot of good tools

670
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
although there's tools on windows 2 that

671
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,200
can be leveraged and i recommend

672
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,240
knowing both of those but go through and

673
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,919
fill in gaps on the things you don't

674
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,720
know so if you're starting from new

675
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,559
from scratch a good example of where to

676
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,799
start would be follow like

677
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,000
the pen say start with a plus

678
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,799
level certification knowledge you don't

679
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,600
necessarily have to get those

680
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
certifications

681
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
but learn the materials from the a plus

682
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,559
certification

683
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,000
learn the items from the network plus

684
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,919
in the security plus and now there's the

685
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,240
pentas plus learn those items

686
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
and that will give you a good base for

687
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,840
pen testing

688
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,039
if you're wanting to do bug hunting then

689
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,960
maybe even spending some time learning

690
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,640
some some web development

691
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,240
learning how to do web developments can

692
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,080
help you be a better bug hunter

693
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,320
so basically when you're developing that

694
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,120
plan

695
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
look at the pieces you're missing and

696
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,559
you know if you're needing to build that

697
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,640
hacking experience do capture the flags

698
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,320
bug bounties and build labs

699
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,159
and no matter what level you're at build

700
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,480
a lab if you're an i.t

701
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,240
then you know you're going to have some

702
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,840
basic skills

703
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,880
so gain your linux skills your set your

704
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,159
security skills

705
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,360
if you're in infosec and you haven't

706
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
worked for linux learn linux or say like

707
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,159
you've got a good

708
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,080
base knowledge but you're lacking the

709
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
hacking piece then that's really what

710
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,399
you're going to want to focus on

711
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
in some labs so you need a lab when

712
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
you're doing you know learning a bit

713
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,640
pentester

714
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,400
and even when you're an experienced pen

715
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
tester security researcher you

716
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,240
need a home lab so you can test your

717
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,280
pocs or your proof of concept code

718
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,960
so if you have an exploit and you're

719
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,039
doing a pen test on a production network

720
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,559
it's good to have a lab to be able to

721
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,159
test these exploits in

722
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,000
because sometimes exploits have adverse

723
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,559
reactions and they could take down a

724
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,240
network take down a system make it

725
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,520
unresponsive

726
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,799
and you want to make sure during your

727
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,480
pin testing you're not crashing systems

728
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,080
that's very important

729
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,919
so having a lab to be able to test that

730
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,520
end is important as an experienced

731
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
pen tester on all levels i do still do

732
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,360
that as well if you find

733
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,840
and you hack out there some new exploit

734
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,679
set it up in your lab and test it out

735
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,200
and see if it works

736
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,120
so the different levels of labs that

737
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,400
i've got listed here

738
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,919
and this can vary these are just kind of

739
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,720
three areas that i've kind of

740
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,760
kind of limited down to but the

741
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,520
minimalist lab is one of my favorites

742
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,159
so you have your laptop or your your

743
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,400
desktop that you use at home

744
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,120
you install like an attack vm as well as

745
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,000
your targets

746
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,240
so this is very basic if you've got like

747
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,000
a mobile device like a laptop

748
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
then you're able to put this your lab

749
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,039
you know

750
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,960
set it up on that system if you get

751
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,720
bored studying at home then you can go

752
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
to a coffee shop or somewhere else and

753
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,400
and study if you're traveling then you

754
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
can still practice

755
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,840
hacking in your labs and then your

756
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,039
dedicated lab

757
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,320
you can have like a dedicated system

758
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,640
with your your vulnerable vms on it

759
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
and then just have your attack system

760
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,760
set up your

761
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
your system you normally use on a daily

762
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,200
basis that could be your tax system

763
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,320
and that way you're going across a

764
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
network so that simulates

765
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,960
you know they go across a network piece

766
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,520
of it

767
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,559
and then you can get more and more

768
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,480
advanced and you can have your separate

769
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,080
systems you can

770
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,480
have like separate desktops or build

771
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
servers on your

772
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,840
on your network you can set up routers

773
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
and switches and firewalls

774
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,480
and get as elaborate as if you want and

775
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,000
even this prior to hacking

776
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,760
just building a home network is good

777
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,840
experience one of my very first pen

778
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,679
testing jobs

779
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,760
my manager who had been pen testing for

780
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,880
quite some while

781
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,159
i always recommend a team he really

782
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,600
wasn't telling us to go out take pen

783
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
testing courses or go to the conferences

784
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,159
and stuff

785
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,799
he said build something you know if you

786
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,640
understand how to install apache web

787
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,279
server

788
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,120
and you understand the directories where

789
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,799
things are contained understand the

790
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,919
security

791
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,840
and what happens if it's not set up

792
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,520
right you understand how to breach that

793
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,720
so learning how to build stuff is a good

794
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,080
way to learn

795
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,480
as well

796
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,120
and one thing to keep in mind with your

797
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,039
home labs

798
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,720
if there's something your priority is to

799
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,880
learn the hacking piece

800
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,799
learning the tools then you may want to

801
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,200
be more simplistic with your lab because

802
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,720
i've run into things in the past where i

803
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,039
had my lab

804
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,039
and i had a hard drive go go bad that

805
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,960
could happen on any level of lab

806
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,360
but the thing here is too is the more

807
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,480
elaborate is

808
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,039
the more chance that you're gonna have

809
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,400
uh system failures

810
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,919
and you're having to rebuild that so

811
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,720
keep that in mind

812
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,120
and so when you you build this your home

813
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,559
lab you're going to need a attack

814
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,679
platform and so kali linux perito s are

815
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,360
really two options that are that are

816
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,840
great from a linux standpoint as well as

817
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,520
ubuntu you can use

818
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,960
trusted sex uh pentester framework

819
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,559
and it's a script that will install all

820
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
the tools that are like in kali linux or

821
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,679
paired os

822
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,559
so if you like ubuntu and that's the way

823
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,320
you want to go this is a great way to go

824
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,279
i've done that before in the past

825
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,679
i would run like ubuntu as my host os

826
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,279
with the pentester framework tool so i

827
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,720
had the pen testing tools on there

828
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,960
and i still have like a kali linux vm as

829
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,559
well as like a windows vm

830
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,080
with some administrative tools and some

831
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,240
hacking tools on that

832
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
and so with windows you have uh commando

833
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
vm scripts by fireeye

834
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,480
you can install those that's set of

835
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,919
scripts and what that does is that

836
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,799
contains

837
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,799
a lot of the different pen testing tools

838
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,480
that you use during a pen test that run

839
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:34,960
on

840
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,760
run on windows and then also that

841
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,159
there's

842
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,039
the flare vm which is fireeye scripts

843
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,799
for reverse engineering so you set that

844
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,200
up on

845
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,279
windows vm you can do so all sorts of

846
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,320
reversing

847
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
on that system and then you have like a

848
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,840
windows device to test with

849
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,520
and i recommend learning how to pen test

850
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,360
with both there's times that

851
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,000
that using windows uh may be more

852
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
conducive and have tools and stuff that

853
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,120
run natively that would be a better

854
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,159
choice at times

855
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,679
so having both of those are a great

856
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,360
option

857
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,760
and paired os i've really gotten to like

858
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,039
compared os

859
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,320
up until recently i hadn't worked with

860
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
paired os but paired os works really

861
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
great for wireless pen testing

862
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
with some of the recent updates to kali

863
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,320
linux some of the tools broke with

864
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,960
and also with going to a lot of things

865
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,159
going to uh

866
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,960
python 3 the dependencies and stuff were

867
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,159
hard to get running so

868
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,399
i was doing a pen test for my employer a

869
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,919
wireless pen test

870
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,880
and so i've used parrot os and i was

871
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,320
able to get a certain alpha driver to

872
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,000
work that i could get working on

873
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,080
kali linux as well as all the tools

874
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
worked there wasn't any

875
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,000
uh things i really had to add extra to

876
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
that as well as any extra tools that i

877
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,240
was

878
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,840
needed to add i was able to add easily

879
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,080
so parrot is really good for

880
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,720
for wireless and also to the just it

881
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,000
makes a good

882
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,559
daily driver linux because security and

883
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,279
privacy

884
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,559
are kept in mind there's some really

885
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,120
good privacy plugins built into

886
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,600
into parrot os2 so it's a really great

887
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,240
product

888
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,880
as well as the support i was installing

889
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,000
something the other day

890
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,559
and oh yes my my work test laptop

891
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,080
i was trying to get the video drivers to

892
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,840
work with hashcat

893
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,080
and so fortunately their website had

894
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,919
good documentation on how to install the

895
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,000
drivers and get it to work so that's

896
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
that's really great sometimes other

897
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,679
distributions it's hard to find

898
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,720
the documents to install drivers and

899
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,240
and software properly

900
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,000
and so the home lab targets you need a

901
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,520
target to attack

902
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,000
so you want to create your your your

903
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,039
vulnerable vms

904
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,799
so you can go to vault hub and download

905
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,159
some vms

906
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,840
uh there's a lot of great vms on there a

907
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,360
lot of them are retired

908
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,960
ctf vms people build ctfs for

909
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,840
different conferences and they'll later

910
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,760
on go up and upload those to

911
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,159
for to vault hook share those with the

912
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,520
community so you can download those and

913
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,440
use those for practice targets

914
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,279
i've used some of those in my home lab

915
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,480
and it's been a really good choice

916
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,960
and metasploit two and three those are

917
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,360
two

918
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,080
vms i highly recommend i would make sure

919
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,039
to install

920
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,960
those two because the thing about those

921
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,720
two uh

922
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,039
you can install version three on windows

923
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,320
which you need practice in a windows

924
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,960
environment

925
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,039
most of your corporate environments are

926
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,640
going to be mainly windows

927
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
so you need practice with that there's a

928
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
lot of vulnerable vms on

929
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,240
on linux due to linux being free

930
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,000
metasploitable 3 uses a

931
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,880
the free version of or a limited time

932
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,039
version of windows because windows

933
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,679
microsoft will post up vms for

934
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,200
developers to test their web apps in

935
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
different browsers

936
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,440
so that vm of windows certain windows

937
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,320
versions

938
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,640
is available for download for free trial

939
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
so that that's used in metasploitable 3.

940
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
wasp has a lot of good red resources web

941
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,799
goats just one of them there's a couple

942
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,399
different versions of web goat

943
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,480
as well as juice shop on their site a

944
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,399
lot of vulnerable vms

945
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,919
a lot of vulnerable apps and some of

946
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,240
those apps are online

947
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,919
and then you can create your own targets

948
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,159
exploit db is a good place for exploits

949
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,080
but it also has vulnerable software

950
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,360
so you can go out there and download the

951
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,679
vulnerable versions of the software

952
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,880
and and uh actually use those to use the

953
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,559
exploits against so that's a really good

954
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,559
way to build a lab and you can kind of

955
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,760
get together with some friends and you

956
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
can do like ctfs you can build a

957
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,960
vulnerable vm

958
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,480
that you know you know what's on it but

959
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,919
your friends don't and you can challenge

960
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,480
each other

961
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,000
so that's a good way to to learn as well

962
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,159
and recommended wheat reading here uh

963
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,039
actually one of the

964
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,880
presenters of the conference the the

965
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,679
very well-known georgia weedman in her

966
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,279
book the penetration testing

967
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,320
a hands-on guide to hacking this was the

968
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,399
book i was using for my my

969
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,399
the first year of teaching at richland

970
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,600
college i was teaching my ethical

971
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,559
hacking class

972
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,320
and the thing i liked about this book is

973
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,600
it shows you how to build a lab and

974
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,399
that's what my

975
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,840
class lab was based off of

976
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,399
i later went on to the pentes plus to

977
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,840
give students

978
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,200
certifications to to uh prepare for

979
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,640
since you know certifications can help

980
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,799
you sometimes in your job

981
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,240
search so we switched that

982
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,240
the hackers playbook two and three is

983
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,279
what i go to next

984
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,200
after after george's book you're going

985
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,360
to learn the basics of pen testing and

986
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,840
so

987
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,120
the hacker playbook gets into more uh

988
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,480
types of techniques and stuff that

989
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,799
you're going to use in an actual real

990
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,640
world pen test

991
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
version two and three are slightly

992
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,320
different version three gets into more

993
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,760
red teaming so you definitely want both

994
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,559
of these books

995
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,480
start with version two and then go to

996
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,760
version three you learn more the red

997
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,039
team techniques

998
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,039
and the web application hackers handbook

999
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,559
the second edition

1000
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,559
that is a really great place to start

1001
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,640
for web app pen testing

1002
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,799
and also the red red team field manual

1003
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,919
is also a good

1004
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,159
little handy reference for different

1005
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,840
commands and

1006
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,720
single liners for different technologies

1007
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,159
that you'll run into during a pen test

1008
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,720
and learning resources so this slide

1009
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,360
here i've got to kind of split up if you

1010
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,679
look

1011
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,760
at there's a top section you see there's

1012
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,120
kind of a space between

1013
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,919
the top section or paid resources

1014
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,600
starting with the most expensive to the

1015
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,880
least expensive

1016
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,679
and the bottom portion are resources

1017
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,120
that are free

1018
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,200
so we have this sans training where sans

1019
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
training is really great it's created by

1020
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,039
some of the industry experts

1021
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,519
most these people work in consulting and

1022
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,200
they teach for sans they develop this

1023
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,919
content

1024
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,080
and it's really great stuff of taking

1025
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,440
taking their

1026
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,840
web application pen testing course one

1027
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,000
of the their ics pen testing course as

1028
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,120
well as

1029
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,480
the advanced pen testing and

1030
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,960
exploitation development course

1031
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,720
which are really good but these are

1032
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,480
typically uh

1033
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
items that you're going to have to have

1034
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
your employer to pay for because it's

1035
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,120
like 7 200

1036
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,360
per course unless you do one of the two

1037
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,200
day courses which is like thirty eight

1038
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,600
hundred

1039
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,159
hundred dollars and then the next level

1040
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:02,720
down

1041
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,399
in a drastic job drop in in prices you

1042
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,480
learn security and offensive security

1043
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,320
you learn security i really like because

1044
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,399
it really gets into good detail

1045
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,559
and actually uh if you're wanting to

1046
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,799
learn web app pen testing

1047
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,159
they have a really good web app pen

1048
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,600
testing course i've taken that in their

1049
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,240
mobile pin testing course

1050
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,840
and so with with them as well as

1051
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,600
offensive security you have to perform

1052
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,880
pen tests

1053
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,760
to pass the certification exam and then

1054
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,720
virtual hacking labs is a nice one for

1055
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,840
uh preparing for the oscp doing network

1056
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,880
pen testing

1057
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,120
there's like windows and linux systems

1058
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,240
set up in an android

1059
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,039
system that you're able to hack they

1060
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,640
give you hints on the easier systems the

1061
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,360
more difficult

1062
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,360
systems they give you less experience so

1063
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,519
they start out easy and build you up

1064
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,360
to where you you you're starting to

1065
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,519
build that mindset and you don't need

1066
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,120
the help and then you're getting the

1067
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,399
point where you're on your own which is

1068
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,039
good

1069
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,960
compared to like offensive security that

1070
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,320
there's no hints there you have to just

1071
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,360
go in

1072
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,200
and do it all on your own that's a good

1073
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,799
way to learn but with the virtual

1074
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,559
hacking labs they kind of gradually help

1075
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,519
you

1076
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,440
learn those skills in advance to more

1077
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,560
difficult systems

1078
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,000
pentester lab and pentester academy are

1079
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,839
great resources

1080
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,480
pentester lab is mostly web application

1081
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,159
pin testing but they also have some

1082
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,399
linux security stuff in there so you can

1083
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,560
learn how to breach

1084
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,359
and exploit linux vulnerabilities if

1085
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,440
there is a possibility to get a shell on

1086
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,719
a system they show you that

1087
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,480
some of the other courses really don't

1088
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,159
go into details about going

1089
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,159
be able to get a shell to a system but

1090
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,239
they do that that's a really good

1091
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,399
good resource there and then practical

1092
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,440
pentester labs

1093
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,199
pentest labs is 64 for lifetime access

1094
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,320
i believe it's mainly if not all

1095
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
linux systems you have a vpn access to

1096
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
that environment

1097
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,239
and there's probably about 12 to 20

1098
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,839
systems

1099
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,160
and it's a really good resource to learn

1100
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,680
there

1101
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,400
then also you got your resources from

1102
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,960
from your

1103
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,000
uh bug bounty companies like hacker one

1104
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,599
and bug crowd blood crowd university has

1105
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,800
some videos

1106
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,960
and some tutorials on there and hacker

1107
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,359
one has hacker 101 this is a great

1108
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,680
resource there's an online ctf

1109
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,119
so you're actually getting something to

1110
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,960
practice those skills again so that's a

1111
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,480
really great way to learn

1112
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,800
uh the sans pen testing blog they have a

1113
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,079
lot of cheat sheets out there

1114
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,079
and a little tutorials on how to use

1115
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,040
certain tools

1116
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,920
and hackingtutorials.org is created by

1117
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,520
the creators of virtual hacking labs

1118
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,800
there's different tutorials on how to

1119
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,079
use nmap

1120
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,440
metasploit different tools and

1121
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,280
techniques that's a great place

1122

sibury has some free content web

1123
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,359

the portsworker.net the web security

1127
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,440
academy on there

1128
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,079
is a real good place to learn uh web app

1129
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,960
pen testing

1130
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,680
they put their the instead of updating

1131
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,079
the

1132
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,160

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,440
advanced

1139
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,560
pen testers and then you have owasp.org

1140
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,119
you have the oasis testing guide as well

1141
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,800
as the os top 10

1142
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,160
and other great resources on their

1143
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
vulnerable vms and then hack the box is

1144
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,839
a good

1145
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,680
resource as well as over the wire ctf

1146
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,839
and under the wire ctf

1147
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,400
uh over the wire is linux based and

1148
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,040
under the wire

1149
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,000
is windows and powershell based and to

1150
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,720
get access

1151
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,480
to these resources if you go to my

1152
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,240
website the hackermaker.com

1153
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,400
forward slash learning dash resources

1154
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,520
you can find

1155
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,440
these links there and certifications

1156
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,599
so certifications are important make

1157
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,200
sure you understand

1158
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,599
the technology make sure you understand

1159
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,400
the context

1160
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,040
content the content don't just memorize

1161
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,440
it

1162
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,640
because this information is going to be

1163
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,079
important on an interview the more you

1164
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,200
know this stuff

1165
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,320
the better you're going to fare in a pen

1166
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,480
tester interview your entry level certs

1167
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,599
or your ceh

1168
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,440
and pen test plus hr

1169
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,920
people that do work with the government

1170
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,599
ch is a dod cert

1171
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,440
so that one's a good one to have with

1172
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,400
companies that do work for the

1173
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,640
government or working for the government

1174
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
and then you get into your intermediate

1175
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,920
and advanced certifications and these

1176
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,880
are ones that are really going to help

1177
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,440
you

1178
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,640
with pen testing jobs

1179
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,599
the sans g pin defensive security oscp

1180
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,040
are two of the most popular search

1181
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,800
you'll see for pen testing jobs along

1182
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,960
with the web application pen testing

1183

cert from

1184
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,480
from sans and then your advanced certs

1185
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,839
the gxpn

1186
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,160
from sans and then osce from offensive

1187
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,200
security

1188
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,839
and as far as the osc oscp and g-pin

1189
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,280
these are similar certs

1190
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,640
but there's hands-on labs where you

1191
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,800
actually have to perform a pen test and

1192
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,440
hack systems to pass those exams

1193
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,960
and that one's pretty good because that

1194
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,880
kind of shows a little more

1195
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,320
technical competency and not just

1196
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,520
knowing the knowledge but knowing how to

1197
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,280
apply the knowledge

1198
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,880
and all the offensive security

1199
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,280
certifications are are that way

1200
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,839
