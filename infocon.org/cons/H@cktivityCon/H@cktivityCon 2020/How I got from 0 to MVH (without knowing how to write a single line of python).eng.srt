[Music]

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,879
so it's

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,440
three o'clock in the morning on the 21st

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,639
of august 2018.

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,560
i'm lying in my bed and i can't sleep

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,279
and the reason why i can't get any sleep

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,960
is because i've been running on one of

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,680
the

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,199
biggest adrenaline brushes i ever had in

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,760
my life leading up to that date

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,880
hi my name is sturk and this is my talk

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,160
from xero to mvh without knowing how to

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,840
write a single line

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,960
of python code so the reason why this

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,280
whole thing happened has nothing to do

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
with me or my skill set

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,680
it had all to do with me being at the

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,719
right place

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,039
at the right time and understanding what

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,160
to do with it

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,199
as a profile in the bounty community i

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,239
get asked on

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,800
multiple locations every day on

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,120
different social media platforms

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,399
stick how do you get started in bug

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,920
bounties

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,799
and it's been like that since i released

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,000
my first vlog

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,479
and started my own journey about two

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,439
years ago

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,960
in the beginning i would say something

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
like go repeat works

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
yvorsky's book or buy the web hacking

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
hack or buy the web application hackers

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,439
handbook

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,920
but to be honest those were good

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,159
recommendations at that time

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,119
but today the more i learned about this

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,240
space

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,320
is that i don't have any simple answer

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,280
anymore

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
it's 20 20 and there are so many

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,479
different

44
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,600
paths to shoes and it can

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
literally be overwhelming just even to

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,920
choose your path

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,119
how do you as a seasoned pen tester

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,479
looking to get some side cash or

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,200
absolute beginner that's wanting to

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,719
change their life

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,200
break into the hacking space that we all

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,079
know

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,119
as bug montes i don't have a universal

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,719
answer for this

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,759
but i have my own experience both good

56
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,959
and bad

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,920
and i'll do my best to share that

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
experience

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
with you one of the first questions that

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,480
usually get

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,599
asked is what program language

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,599
should i learn and my answer would be

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,720
select one that resonates with you

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
a language that you like it's just like

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,200
learning any kind of other language

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,920
right

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
yes because a huge part of the world's

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,120
population

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,879
speaks mandarin chinese maybe

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,680
spanish is a better fit for you learning

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,080
is

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,599
so much easier when you're having fun

73
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,120
and not forcing yourself so

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
choose a language that you like and then

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,239
you

76
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,519
stick with it it could be javascript go

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,720
bash rust ruby

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,040
or even python the choice is yours

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,239
so what choice did i do i didn't do any

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,519
of that

81
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
i focused on what i did is the opposite

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
instead of learning any programming

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,480
language i focused on

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,000
um business logic so i spent a lot of

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
time trying to identify and understand

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,879
file upload vulnerabilities

87
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,400
and business logic because that

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
was something i was more comfortable

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,239
with with i don't have a developer's

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,680
background so for me

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,519
starting to learn a language before i

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,040
started hacking

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
was going to be a very steep uphill ride

94
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,239
for me

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,239
so i'd rather go for something that i

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,760
understood

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,040
and that is the reason why i couldn't

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,159
sleep that night

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,440
because on the 21st of august

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,120
tavis dropped the ghost script bug

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,439
and in 24 hours i made more money

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
than i did in a whole year leading up to

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,840
that

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,599
and it's an honest statement to say that

105
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,080
i got bitten by the bounty bug that

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
night

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,280
because i spent 20 hours writing the poc

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,400
getting that payload to work

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
eventually smuggling things over dns to

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,440
show impact and

111
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,240
and i learned so much during those hours

112
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,680
and the most important

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
takeaway of that was that i realized at

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
that time

115
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,080
that it was possible i could find

116
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,280
chris and i've been continuing doing

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,680
that

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,840
ever since for me it was a mindset

119
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,520
i can do this and that is possible for

120
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,080
you

121
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,560
too because they are out there we just

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
need to look for them

123
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,280
or understand how to train ourselves

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,320
to look for them all this comes from

125
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,600
luck and experience because you see

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
something you recognize it

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,960
and you know what to do with it one of

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
the other questions that i usually get

129
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,240
is stuck do you know any

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,280
easy programs for beginners

131
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,880
the short answer here is sadly

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,240
no because i i have no idea what your

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,199
background is

134
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,560
or what's your skill set maybe

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,039
you will into mobile app development for

136
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,639
the last five years to know

137
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,520
everything about mobile apps then

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,400
definitely that's an area for you

139
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,720
maybe you never even open chrome dev

140
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,680
tools and

141
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,080
have no understanding of the basics of

142
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
networking at all

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
then there's going to be another path

144
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,800
for you

145
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
the thing is that there is actually no

146
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,280
easy programs

147
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,560
this is bug bounties and you're hacking

148
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,960
on

149
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
some of the most hardened targets on the

150
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,960
market

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
and if you find easy bugs then you can

152
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,280
bet your ass it's gonna be dupe but

153
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,000
setting it

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,240
anyway practice writing that report

155
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,919
a bug is a bug a dupe or not a dupe

156
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,319
and it will help you with your scoring

157
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,160
and your self-esteem

158
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,440
the concept here is simple celebrate

159
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,639
all your wins found a bug

160
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,000
yes triatha says he's a dupe

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
found a bug but how do you then practice

162
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,319
how do you build a skill set if you're

163
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
not able to find bugs or if you don't

164
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,720
even know what a bug looks like

165
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,840
well there's a lot of different stuff

166
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,199
and places where you can practice on

167
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,160
today

168
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,880
there's os views lab there's sportswear

169
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
gears web application academy

170
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,039
and there's platforms dedicated to this

171
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
kind of stuff like try hack me

172
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,720
hack the box and painters the labs

173
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
all of these are amazing and super fun

174
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,039
platforms

175
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,840
but they aren't hard and live targets

176
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,039
these are designed to have

177
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,319
vulnerabilities

178
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,120
they're good practice rounds but they

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,039
will really differ

180
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,759
from the real world unless it's a

181
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,199
defined one to

182
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,479
look really much like a real world one

183
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,599
ability

184
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,039
and to be honest i didn't do any of that

185
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,080
because i what i did is i created a

186
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,800
habit of always having burp running

187
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
no matter what i did i turned up

188
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
turned off all the active scanners and i

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,199
enable as many passive ones that i could

190
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,400
sure burp ate almost all my ram

191
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,720
all the time but that was a sacrifice i

192
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
was willing to make

193
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,599
and then i put that on my secondary

194
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,479
screen

195
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,400
where i had flower logic plus plus

196
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,759
always running

197
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,199
so i got used to see the traffic

198
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,160
that flew flowed through my browser and

199
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,039
i

200
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,039
without really knowing in the beginning

201
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,319
what i was looking at

202
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
i can see how my browser communicated

203
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,759
with the servers

204
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,039
and i learned how web apps communicated

205
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
now i know most of the hdb status codes

206
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,599
by heart and

207
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,360
the things that i miss the passive

208
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
scanners will eventually show up

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,319
like misconfiguration or maybe some

210
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,599
information leakage

211
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,599
because i've been adapting some things

212
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,120
that i learned along the way to

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,400
alert me for that and

214
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,199
just like tank in the matrix i got used

215
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
to identify the anomalies

216
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
so inside the request flow maybe the

217
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
reply was a bit too big

218
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,000
or maybe there was this weird error code

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
coming back

220
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
maybe there's a 500 we're not supposed

221
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,120
to be and i

222
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
trained myself to ignore everything that

223
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,560
was normal

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,959
and to look for the stuff that stood out

225
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,600
i kind of built that mentality and just

226
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,000
like

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,160
clc would say hmm that's interesting

228
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,720
and i would dig into that sometimes it

229
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
was nothing

230
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,480
but sometimes it turning turned out to

231
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,360
be something

232
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,640
really really interesting just like the

233
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,800
tumblr bug that i found in 2018 that was

234
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,000
identified and fixed within

235
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,480
12 hours and that was primarily due to

236
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,200
watching the responses okay okay okay i

237
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,920
get it

238
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,200
but seriously how do i start

239
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,160
to look for security bugs the simple

240
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
answer here

241
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,839
is that you start because taking action

242
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,320
is everything that matters

243
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,839
one of the most important things that

244
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,360
i've learned in life

245
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,640
is not to compare yourself with others

246
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,360
this has been especially proven useful

247
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
at live hacking events

248
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,360
you're surrounded by some of the best

249
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,959
brains in the community

250
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,000
in a highly competitive environment it's

251
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,040
a first-come

252
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,079
first-served kind of situation

253
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,839
and you're all looking at the same

254
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,760
target that's been

255
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,519
a public program for a couple of years

256
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,680
what are the chances there will be any

257
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
bugs there

258
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,000
there surely can't be any bugs there

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,760
right

260
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,160
but if 30 to 40 hackers that spend

261
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,000
everything from a few weeks to a couple

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,800
of days

263
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,399
can make 500 000 almost a million

264
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
dollars in one evening

265
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,600
the limitation isn't the availability of

266
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,959
bugs

267
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,640
it's the mindset of the participants

268
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,680
so if you decided to be

269
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,720
one of the few that actually do want to

270
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,279
start

271
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,320
and not just redissold the write-up

272
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,600
and do the doom scrolling on the infosec

273
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,959
on twitter and just waiting and waiting

274
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,040
waiting for that perfect moment when to

275
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,439
begin

276
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,800
then the key is to always approach the

277
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,440
target

278
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,640
like you're the first one there

279
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,240
imagine that just seconds before

280
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,279
you hit that url in the browser

281
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,480
boom the devs just pushed a

282
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,519
fresh commit it's all yours and it's

283
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,720
bugs

284
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,000
everywhere all you have to do is to use

285
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,279
your methodology

286
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,240
and look for them now that sets the

287
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,600
intention

288
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,399
and that's the way how you will find the

289
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,279
bugs

290
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,560
i'm a vivid burp user and i realize

291
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,480
that tools um i don't i don't need to

292
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,120
understand

293
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
how to build them how to use them like i

294
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,800
i don't know how to build microsoft

295
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
office word

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
but i can use that to write stuff

297
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,360
later on that would be helpful to

298
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,760
understand how scripts work or maybe you

299
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,320
know

300
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
how tools work but in the beginning all

301
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,519
you need to do is to

302
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,880
master the tools that are out there so

303
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
learn how to use nmap or learn how to

304
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,800
use burp or

305
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,360
your browser or dev tools you don't need

306
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,000
to understand

307
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,639
fully how they work you need to

308
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,120
understand

309
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
how to run them so if your recon game

310
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,680
isn't that strong or you're a non-deaf

311
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
person

312
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,320
instead of just going for the breath and

313
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,880
building your massive recon automation

314
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,639
infrastructure

315
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,920
maybe going for depth will work for you

316
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
then it doesn't hurt to have that mega

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,680
automation so you can

318
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,240
feed the bugs you find into that and

319
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,560
then eventually

320
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,040
find the bugs automatically to download

321
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,079
your recon

322
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,639
you have all these great sub domains and

323
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,560
you have this main app

324
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,240
and you're ready to get started but

325
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,200
where do you begin how do you how do you

326
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,399
sign up for it

327
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,279
is there any third party involved any

328
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,639
single sign-on

329
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,320
oh wow is there any emails coming out

330
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,519
is there two-factor enable

331
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,480
what kind of services does it use where

332
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,440
is it hosted

333
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,720
is it running on windows or nginx

334
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,760
does it live in aws google cloud

335
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,880
azure or is it self-hosted all these

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,040
things plays a big role

337
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
in what you can extract later on if you

338
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,600
find things like ssr frcs and similar

339
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,240
bugs

340
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,880
is there any file uploads within this

341
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,600
application

342
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
maybe there's a profile page with an

343
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,959
avatar on it

344
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,560
does that app also support imports and

345
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,399
exports of user data

346
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,920
can you play around with that what

347
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,040
happens if you're on the avatar page

348
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,320
and you upload and you change the

349
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,920
content of the file

350
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,480
how does the app deal with that how does

351
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,519
it deal with

352
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,560
getting a png file with the contents of

353
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,160
a tiff file but has

354
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,720
pdf as the content type i've found some

355
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,360
really

356
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
interesting stack traces using this

357
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,639
technique

358
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,360
sometimes even hidden within the file

359
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,079
itself

360
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,399
after the file has been uploaded is

361
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,440
there any

362
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,480
api on the application if so

363
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,120
how does it work is there version one

364
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
two three and so on and what happens if

365
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,279
you take a request from version three

366
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:21,680
and

367
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,600
run it through version one does it have

368
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,760
any mobile app that you can use and

369
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,800
interact with

370
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,440
maybe it talks directly to the api maybe

371
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,800
it uses

372
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,600
some other endpoints that your web app

373
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,240
can't see

374
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,600
that's juicy and not really secured

375
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,160
and it's always good to check if there's

376
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,079
any kind of user levels within the app

377
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,360
you know

378
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,160
hey sign up two user accounts one that's

379
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,800
gonna be admin and one is gonna be user

380
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
then take the cookies from the low

381
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
privileged user and

382
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,639
smash them into authorize and walk the

383
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,079
website as admin

384
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,079
if user can do the same thing as admin

385
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,120
problem is there maybe some weird

386
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
business logic there maybe some parsers

387
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,720
maybe some pdf exports printouts

388
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,399
is there any internal pesky squid

389
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,440
process that stops you from getting that

390
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,480
iframe working in your pdf export

391
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
all these things are

392
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,199
possible for you to test for and

393
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,040
identify without

394
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,759
having to know a single line of code or

395
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,759
write any scripts

396
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,560
it's just right there in the traffic

397
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,959
between your browser

398
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,040
and the server collaboration

399
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
most of the things that i've learned

400
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,639
during the last years

401
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
i picked up by collaborating with

402
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
friends

403
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,279
in the beginning i was trying to learn

404
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,560
verb together with my friend lon and

405
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,279
as soon as i learn some of the stuff and

406
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,000
new

407
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
concepts and techniques i try to share

408
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,759
them

409
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,480
with others because teaching others

410
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,440
forces you in to really deeply

411
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
understand the concept

412
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,519
because it's really really hard to

413
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,040
explain something super technical

414
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,560
in simple terms for somebody that

415
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,399
has no understand what you're talking

416
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,040
about i've always stated that i

417
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,240
love people more than i love computers

418
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,839
and believe me i love computers a lot

419
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,880
so i really love people

420
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,680
so when there wasn't the word lockdown i

421
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,160
spent

422
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,800
most of my spare cash to travel to

423
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,240
conferences

424
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,800
to network and meet people and learn

425
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,639
from others and

426
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,399
eventually get to the stage where i get

427
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,160
to share what i have learned

428
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,759
i joined forums slack channels and

429
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,320
hey now we got discords and and all

430
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,480
these places where people can meet they

431
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,440
just

432
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,759
at least start to collaborate but to be

433
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,800
honest i've

434
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,799
really never been a pure team player

435
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,959
all my interest when it comes to sports

436
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,880
has always been

437
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,359
tilted towards the kind of soul

438
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,799
activities

439
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,880
so i wasn't the big soccer guy

440
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,679
but i really really enjoyed doing things

441
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,160
in a

442
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
group setting like skateboarding

443
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,559
skeet and marksmanship shooting cooking

444
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,120
and hey even competitive speed cubing

445
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,039
that's things that you're doing as an

446
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,880
individual but you're doing it

447
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,200
together the same thing goes for hacking

448
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,559
the thing is that we don't exactly do

449
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,480
the same thing

450
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
but we're doing it together and

451
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,280
so when you're collaborating with

452
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,960
someone you're

453
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
also kind of learning from each other

454
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,039
because you're seeing different kind of

455
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,400
views

456
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,760
and i really enjoy collaborative hacking

457
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,919
hacking with friends and winning with

458
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:04,799
friends is

459
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,600
something that i value more than doing

460
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,720
it on my own

461
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,840
and i've been really really blessed

462
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,679
to win not only one belt

463
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,760
for the most valuable team award with

464
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,480
the 1993 karate gala whackers

465
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,120
but also win the best team award with

466
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,400
disturbance

467
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,919
and if you're deciding to collaborate

468
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,080
with someone

469
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,280
while doing bounties just make sure that

470
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,840
you

471
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
set a couple of clear goals or create

472
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
clear rules

473
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,160
before you begin because when

474
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,600
money is involved things get tough

475
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,039
and believe me it's never worth

476
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
losing a friend over a bounty so before

477
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,640
you begin

478
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,840
to do a full collaboration just

479
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,160
define should we do a 50 50 split

480
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,280
or even a 60 40 where the

481
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720
finder gets the bigger cut

482
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
or how do we deal with the aftermath

483
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,760
cvs and additional stuff if a bug

484
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
surfaces at a later stage

485
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,039
do the original finder get that extra

486
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,000
finers bonus

487
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,799
because they kind of created the payload

488
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,320
that the rest of the

489
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
group gets to share well these are

490
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,080
things that are

491
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,200
super important to have defined before

492
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,640
you begin

493
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,320
because if you don't it can become

494
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,120
extremely

495
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,480
salty afterwards

496
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,679
and like i said it's not

497
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,120
worth losing friends over making money

498
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
is easy

499
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,480
but maintaining long-term relationships

500
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,520
that's hard

501
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,880
thank you for uh listening to my talk

502
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,919
it's been a pleasure presenting here

503
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,840
i hope to see you again in the future um

504
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,840
stay curious
