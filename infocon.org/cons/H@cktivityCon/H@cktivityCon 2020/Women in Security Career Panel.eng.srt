00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:06,960
hi

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,840
everyone and welcome to this panel about

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,280
women in security

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,960
career panel my name is carolyn sulhwar

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,400
and i will be the moderator i work as a

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,800
community manager at detectify

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,640
and specifically at detectified

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,840
crowdsource

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,800
and detective crowdsource is kind of a

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,000
bug bounty program

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,400
but with a little bit of a twist so

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,320
instead of targeting

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,200
specific companies we are targeting

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,160
commonly used technologies instead

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,239
and my background i actually started as

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,640
a sailor when i was 14 years old and did

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
that for nine years

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,719
but after doing that for a while i

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,399
realized it was time to do something new

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,920
so i started to study business and

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,199
computer science

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,280
and after that i've been working in the

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,199
tech industry

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,520
and for all of these years i always been

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
very

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,920
interested in working with questions

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,719
around

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,879
diversity and inclusiveness in the tech

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,760
industry

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
and done a lot of work around that so be

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,760
leading this panel today feels

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
really great but we're not here to talk

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,760
about me

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
i'm joined with four amazing women aspen

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,680
linbloom

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,240
katie paxton fear chrissy morgan and

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,880
alisa

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,840
herrera i'm really honored to have you

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,560
guys here

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
and i thought we could start with just a

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
short presentation where you can tell a

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
little bit about yourself

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
and maybe also why you

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
started with hacking and i thought maybe

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
aspen you could start

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,079
sure hey i'm massa limbloom i currently

48
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
work at crowdstrike as a threat analyst

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,759
and before crowdstrike i was working in

50
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,079
i.t for a couple years like eight years

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,119
and i got started into um i got i got

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,880
interested into security there

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,000
because i was around for ransomware it

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
was like a big deal back then

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,119
it still is and uh we had customers who

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,240
were just getting hacked

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
and being in it i had no idea how they

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,399
were getting hacked and there was

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,399
respect that curiosity of like

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
how is this happening that eventually

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,720
led me to switching to cyber security

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,280
and that's

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,760
a very short story of how i got into

64
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,480
cyber security

65
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,800
amazing and uh katie how about you um so

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,239
i've been doing it for around 18 years i

67
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,120
started

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
in helpdesk when i was quite young um

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,080
but it's only like the last seven years

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,280
that i've actually really taken an

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,000
interest into security research

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
so i've taken part in ctfs which have

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
been really useful

74
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,480
massive learning curve and now i spend

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
my personal time developing my skills

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,440
further

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
i just really like to figure things out

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,640
how they work

79
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
can i make them do things they're not

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
supposed to that sort of thing

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,519
um it's just a real interest and a

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,239
passion for me really

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,879
i now work as an information security

84
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,440
officer

85
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
in the daytime but i do a lot of

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,840
security research in the evenings

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,760
how about you uh

88
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,680
i am a phd student at cranfield

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,200
university um

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
which is really how i got started in

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,239
security

92
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,360
former data scientist um

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,879
and my phd is about uh nlp

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,680
and cyber security so machine learning i

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,480
got into

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,640
bug bounty specifically in june last

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,560
year and i've been

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,599
an occasional bug hunter since and also

99
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,080
i make youtube videos full time i am

100
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,599
still waiting for the nobel prize

101
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,200
committee to get back to me

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,159
for my for my entry of more hours in the

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,959
day

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,319
so i'm still waiting on hearing back

105
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,680
from them

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
amazing hope they answer soon

107
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
melissa i currently work as a

108
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,080
senior security engineer for zoom i

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,159
started bug bounties when i was around

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,799
16

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
but my first i guess taste of security

112
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
was around when i was in middle school

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
playing around the school with laptops

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
and all that

115
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,320
great and i mean you all have different

116
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
and very interesting backgrounds in how

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,320
you

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
got into hacking but what is it that

119
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,840
motivates you to hack

120
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,320
okay um i would say i really like to

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,400
learn new technologies and learning

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,120
something new

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
and um almost like solving a puzzle that

124
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,040
and plus

125
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
i also want to make it's gonna sound

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
really cheesy i want to make the world a

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,440
safer place for my kids

128
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,560
uh so that's why i like to hack

129
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,360
as well as i'd like to learn and there

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
is some excitement when you kind of

131
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
break something that you really

132
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,720
shouldn't

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,160
um so yeah

134
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,840
uh i'm in it because drugs are illegal

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,560
and

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
hacking something and getting that high

137
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
of finding a bug

138
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,280
and knowing oh my god i can't believe i

139
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,080
did that

140
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,320
this is incredible how do they develop

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,520
and let the sin

142
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,560
the rush of it um is great

143
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,120
and that's why hack i love that feeling

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,080
of

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,440
trying to do something for a really long

146
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,360
time and then cracking it

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
like cracking the case it feels

148
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
incredible and it's just

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,840
the most motivating thing and i feel

150
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,320
like

151
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,720
i'm the smartest person who's ever

152
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,919
existed

153
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,599
and it gets duped so i don't

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
yeah like i said before uh with me i

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
like figuring things out

156
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,639
but i also think that deep down inside

157
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,800
me there's a quite a protective instinct

158
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,880
um so from my previous career it's

159
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
coming and now i like to protect things

160
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,080
during the day as well as

161
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,840
breaking things also so it's that part

162
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
i guess for me it would be primarily

163
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,600
learning but also

164
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
as the other panelists have said to sort

165
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,280
of make the place for

166
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,680
a world a better place as with all these

167
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,039
three breeches you always constantly

168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,159
hear the news and all that

169
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
yeah and when you approach the company

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,120
what

171
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,840
what do you look for

172
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
anything specific that you think this is

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,360
a this is a good way to start when

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
you're looking for something or when

175
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,880
you're

176
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,680
finding a specific target having a baby

177
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,759
safe harbor there's always good stuff

178
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,800
i don't look for bdi or

179
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,599
what i like to look for is if they have

180
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,319
apps

181
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,919
or apis that's usually if i see

182
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,919
that in the scope i'm like done i'm

183
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,960
there i'm going for it

184
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,120
for me it's all about communication i

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
like to work with

186
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
uh programs that will work with me and

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
ones that i know

188
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,919
will kind of especially when i was just

189
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,599
starting out last year

190
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,520
one that would be quite friendly if i

191
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
didn't quite understand everything and

192
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,000
one that would be quite understanding

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
so for me it was a lot about finding

194
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,440
those programs that

195
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
want researchers to go and look at them

196
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,639
but also

197
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
when you do they're not going to be

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,319
really dismissive or be like sorry

199
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,240
you're not you're not a pro i'm not

200
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,080
interested but far more

201
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
you know being friendly and responsive

202
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,120
and

203
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
being genuinely wanting to work with a

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,560
hacker instead of just

205
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,840
forget they exist until they find a bug

206
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,160
yeah i think i think it was you chrissy

207
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,639
i saw a talk that you did when you

208
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,680
compared

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,599
i don't remember his name i was some

210
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,199
some old guy from the

211
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,919
1800s or something who picked locked

212
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,639
yeah and

213
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,360
yeah i thought it was a really great

214
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
comparison

215
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
of uh being a hacker and and picking

216
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
locks yeah

217
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,319
old school hacker yeah he did his thing

218
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,840
and it's quite good and i mean on that

219
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,319
talk

220
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,440
i spoke about obviously because my

221
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,360
comment was ready in place and

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
a safe harbor um and corresponding with

223
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,160
what kate is saying find somewhere that

224
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,800
you know ideally is part of a bug bounty

225
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
program for me because i do a lot of

226
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,919
research that isn't part of bug bounty

227
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,440
programs so

228
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,120
finding someone that's accommodating off

229
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
that and can have communication and can

230
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,440
be

231
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
empathetic that you are a security

232
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,799
researcher telling them and

233
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,200
trying to help them it's always been a

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,240
very good thing because sometimes you

235
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,760
just find things as you're going about

236
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,200
your daily life you know

237
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
and then because you're part of this

238
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,480
industry you want to explore it further

239
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,120
so

240
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,720
having that in place is always a good

241
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
sign

242
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,080
definitely and i mean when you when when

243
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
we talk about hacking there's a lot of

244
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
uh focus on the

245
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,560
on the technical sides and on actually

246
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,040
uh

247
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
coding but uh at least i thought it

248
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,480
would be really interesting to hear your

249
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,839
point of view since uh

250
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,440
from what i understand you actually

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
don't code that much

252
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,320
um primarily when i started there was

253
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
really no interest in programming as it

254
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,519
always seemed there's a bit

255
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,360
too abstract for the concept for me to

256
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,959
understand

257
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,839
but through i guess through various

258
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,120
after the flags and

259
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,880
sort of playing around with like

260
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,240
bounties and things like that i've sort

261
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
of realized that

262
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,640
the necessary the necessity to use

263
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,920
programming or understanding how to

264
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,640
build things

265
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,000
to break them isn't really always true

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,240
as there are other ways to approach it

267
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
where you could simply understand

268
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,959
how how a website for example works

269
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,560
and how things are processed for that

270
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,480
without understanding how actually

271
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,440
how it would be in theory built there's

272
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,240
also

273
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,519
a lot of vulnerabilities and

274
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,720
ways you can report and find bounties

275
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
for example

276
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
through methods that don't even require

277
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
any sort of intrinsic knowledge of

278
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,399
coding or understanding how stuff works

279
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,800
um some of the easiest boundaries i've

280
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,600
gotten were

281
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,079
simply through using a google search

282
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,120
engine and

283
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
simply just searching for the right

284
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
queries and finding sensitive data that

285
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,360
was sort of left

286
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,600
out in the open for a company's website

287
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
for example

288
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,560
yeah how do others feel do you think um

289
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
like what uh what other skills that

290
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,399
technical do you think is important

291
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,640
um i think a big one is communication i

292
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
think people forget that once you find a

293
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,120
bug

294
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,760
that's half the story you also need to

295
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
report that

296
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,800
and a lot of people who get into bug

297
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
bounties are very technical people

298
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
and they assume the post on the other

299
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,200
end is also the same amount of technical

300
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,160
as they are

301
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,120
and i think one thing is if you're not

302
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,320
necessarily

303
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
a technical person you develop those

304
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
technical skills if you're a technical

305
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,560
um person you have to develop those

306
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,320
communication skills because

307
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,920
half of doing bug bounty or even

308
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
security in general

309
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,519
is reporting your findings making it

310
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,880
clear what you found

311
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,640
how you found it how it could be

312
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,800
exploited and describing that impact

313
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,120
and a lot of the time especially not

314
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,959
just in bug bounty but in further

315
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,200
uh infosec you might end up in a

316
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,320
situation

317
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,000
where actually um you can

318
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
you have to explain your findings to

319
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
somebody

320
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,959
who really doesn't care about security

321
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,440
unless you put it in their terms they're

322
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,519
gonna be your senior managers

323
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,200
you have to tell them you're gonna lose

324
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,959
a lot of money and it's

325
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,959
finding that right balance of i think

326
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,399
communication skills and if you already

327
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,760
have those skills

328
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
then the technical stuff you can learn

329
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
along the way but communication is

330
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,120
really really keen people always forget

331
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,360
that

332
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,600
yeah katie like whenever you talk i'm

333
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,040
always like preach because you're like

334
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
always on fire

335
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
and i'm like in church but you're

336
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,839
absolutely right i wasn't saying the

337
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,360
same thing written communication

338
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,240
is so important if you can document and

339
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
and like fully like detailed

340
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,480
you know of you know to reproduce what

341
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
you did not only that but explain

342
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,440
why it's important to someone just just

343
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,920
like

344
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
either because you're trying to deliver

345
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
this to uh an executive

346
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,279
they have to buy in that this is a

347
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
problem and if you can't convey

348
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,120
why it's a problem then they're not

349
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,320
going to listen to you or they're just

350
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
going to disregard what you say

351
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,760
so yeah katie you're 100 percent

352
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,920
accurate

353
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,760
yeah i agree as well uh just to add to

354
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
that uh patience

355
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,600
patience is very important because

356
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,279
you'll find yourself that you may need

357
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,200
to wait out for a little while

358
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
and having effective communication while

359
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
you keep up with that patience

360
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,880
while the process goes on you know it's

361
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,200
a big skill to master definitely

362
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,320
okay so let's go back a little bit to

363
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,880
you and your specific carriers because

364
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,639
you all have very different backgrounds

365
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,120
and

366
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,839
you do very different things so what

367
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,040
what areas do you

368
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,120
specialize in and and why

369
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,639
and maybe chrissy you want to start

370
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,000
because when we talked about this

371
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,839
earlier you told me that you are

372
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,399
now going more in towards hardware

373
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
hacking and iot and i thought that

374
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,120
sounds like a really

375
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,320
interesting area yeah um so i come from

376
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
a physical security background also

377
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
i used to be a bodyguard and i like

378
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,160
things physical

379
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
home security systems alarms that sort

380
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
of stuff and it was one of the main

381
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,519
things that actually drew me to

382
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,399
doing further research started with rfid

383
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,440
hacking and

384
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
continued on from there and now i'm

385
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,360
interested in

386
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,959
iot devices which brings a whole

387
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,720
spectrum of skill sets that you need

388
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,240
so web mobile hands-on stuff

389
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,760
embedded systems um you know you also

390
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,320
have

391
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,279
the code the firmware and it's just so

392
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,320
interesting

393
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
um but it's very therapeutic at the same

394
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,079
time because i love getting a device

395
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,680
and then opening it up and then working

396
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,480
with it and i find that very relaxing

397
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,079
it's not like coding which is sometimes

398
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,920
a bit frustrating um

399
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,920
but definitely i find it very

400
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,839
a very diverse area to work and always

401
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,040
keeps me interested

402
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,800
um so yeah that's that's me now

403
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,560
how about how about you elisa what uh

404
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,839
what do you specialize in right now

405
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
i guess currently i'm currently doing

406
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,199
more

407
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,160
yes intelligence gathering type stuff as

408
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,360
such has been driven

409
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,279
like reconnaissance sort of intelligence

410
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,639
gatherings or finding

411
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,959
information and data that's not exactly

412
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,720
supposed to be out there and

413
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,160
that's sort of been the more interesting

414
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,360
stuff i've been playing with recently as

415
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,800
quite a lot of the vulnerabilities i've

416
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,399
been finding lately has been

417
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,279
a lot of that sort of data leakages that

418
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,800
are not exactly supposed to be out there

419
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,760
or

420
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,880
using publicly breached data that's been

421
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,440
known

422
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,839
for other websites and using you know

423
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,639
reusing

424
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,760
passwords different reviews with

425
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,680
different companies and things like that

426
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
and sort of applying that to you know

427
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,040
various administrative panels

428
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
for companies that may have might not

429
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,480
have changed their passwords for things

430
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,279
after we've

431
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,639
reached for example so that's sort of

432
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,160
what i've been focusing on currently

433
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,519
and you kitty so like aspen

434
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,199
i'm a big fan and anyone who watch my

435
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,920
videos will know i'm a big fan of apis

436
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,199
uh i used to be uh when i was doing data

437
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,639
science it was kind of half my job the

438
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,320
other half was as a developer

439
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,880
so your blog standard web developer so i

440
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,759
know a lot

441
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,759
and almost when i see like an api

442
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,399
endpoint my brain goes into developer

443
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,519
mode and it's like

444
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,079
i can understand how i would program

445
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:50,800
that

446
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,759
and to be quite honest the mistakes i

447
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,000
would

448
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,639
make programming that so for quite a lot

449
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,639
of it for me i really enjoy that because

450
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,279
there's a

451
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,839
big challenge there of actually doing

452
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,720
things like

453
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
finding all the api endpoints because

454
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
they're not necessarily that obvious

455
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,839
um but actually i really like

456
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,560
the kind of being able to piece it

457
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
together in my mind like a puzzle and

458
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,000
really seeing that full picture of you

459
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
come in and using my developer skills as

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,959
well thinking

461
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
oh yeah that looks weird because i

462
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,560
wouldn't do it that way

463
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,959
and this is what i'd expect it to look

464
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,160
like but it doesn't look like that and

465
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,399
then using that knowledge to then find

466
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,800
a bug

467
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
and ask them do you want to

468
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,320
share anything i just crucially see them

469
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,000
as well um

470
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
so i don't have much experience with web

471
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,839
development

472
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,199
or developing apis either but

473
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,160
i'm surrounded by apis at work so i

474
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,680
clung to that because i was familiar

475
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,399
with that

476
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,880
as well as reverse engineering um i

477
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,800
reverse engineer malware and scripps

478
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,040
for work and so i i when i had the

479
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,959
opportunity to do that to learn it

480
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
with android apps because it's easier

481
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,679
than ios at the moment for me at least

482
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,520
those are the two areas that i you know

483
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,679
went for and then once i realized that

484
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,559
you know

485
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,880
android apps uses apis i was like no

486
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,319
brainer i just have to go with the

487
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,599
android apps

488
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,319
so that's what i focus on and i i

489
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,079
probably spend too much time

490
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,919
in the learning phase before i start

491
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,000
attacking but i really like to

492
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
understand how it works and then i can

493
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,199
figure out when

494
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,080
it's misbehaving once you understand it

495
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,640
so that's what i focus on

496
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,600
cool and i thought we should talk or

497
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,639
else did you want to say something

498
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,360
no okay i thought we should talk a

499
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,280
little bit about

500
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,960
interesting vulnerabilities and bugs

501
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,720
that you have found and

502
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,960
i was thinking about you katie because i

503
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,000
i've heard about your

504
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
actually your first pack that you ever

505
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,520
discovered or it was two of them

506
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,880
from ebay and i thought that sounded as

507
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,760
such an achievement your first bugs and

508
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,520
there were two and they were at uber so

509
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,799
could you tell a little bit more about

510
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,120
that story yeah i was

511
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,000
really fortunate that um i got to be a

512
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,640
mentee

513
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
at one of the hacking hacker one live

514
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,039
hacking events uh in london

515
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,679
and i remember going down the train i

516
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,280
brought my colleague with me and i was

517
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,679
like

518
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,440
i'm not finding anything i have no idea

519
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
what i'm doing

520
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,000
this just sounded like fun um and i was

521
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
like i'm not gonna find anything

522
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,960
it's fine um and we we went in we had to

523
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,559
make this tour about i'd never used bert

524
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,120
before

525
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,000
i had the option to do a cyber security

526
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,520
course in university and i turned it

527
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,720
down because i thought it would be too

528
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,000
difficult

529
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,360
um so first time using burp um i was

530
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,160
playing around

531
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,440
with a mobile app and i was kind of just

532
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
poking at it

533
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,600
and i realized something that one of the

534
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,480
requests

535
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,919
looked a little bit different from how

536
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,160
the rest of the other requests looked in

537
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,039
the app

538
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,480
and as a developer that really does

539
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
set off my brain a little bit like

540
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
something looking a little bit different

541
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,280
to me means that it was implemented

542
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,400
differently

543
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,799
so i did that um i was poking it around

544
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,799
i thankfully had a hacka1

545
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,120
mentor with me who was kind of telling

546
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,679
me oh try this try this try this

547
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,520
um we have actually found that it was an

548
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
idol which is a really fancy term which

549
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,520
just means that you can access a

550
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,919
resource you shouldn't be able to access

551
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,000
and it was great and the problem we had

552
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,039
then was okay

553
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,120
how can we how can we exploit this

554
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,520
further and i was just playing around in

555
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,960
the app and taking a lot of different

556
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,000
requests and thought

557
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,960
oh i'll make that number zero zero zero

558
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,919
zero zero

559
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,720
uh i'll make it two million uh and it

560
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,360
worked

561
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,280
and i managed to like change some

562
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,640
pricing stuff

563
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,000
um so not only when uh could i

564
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
like do the initial idol but i could

565
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,440
also mess around with some

566
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,679
number and quantities and then it was

567
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,520
like okay well i made that

568
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,400
negative and then uber owes me lots of

569
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,440
money

570
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,960
and that also worked and oh my god

571
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,440
we were literally so i did that i was

572
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,799
like oh my god i can't believe i found

573
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,720
my first bugs

574
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
so we get to like the very last and

575
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
we're talking here the last five minutes

576
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
of the life hacking event

577
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,320
and me and my mentor are both stressed

578
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,000
out and we're trying to write up the

579
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,679
report i've no idea how to write a

580
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,320
report

581
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
we're trying our best literally we

582
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
submit the report

583
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,559
one minute before submissions close uh

584
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,799
and i'm shaking i'm shaking so much

585
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,440
that i can't even think he has to go

586
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
have a cigarette because it's just been

587
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,280
way too stressful for him to deal with

588
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,600
and we both we finally calmed down and

589
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,120
then uh one of the

590
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,679
um like people running the event came up

591
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,159
to us

592
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,960
and had a laptop in his hand uh and i

593
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
was like what and he's like

594
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,320
i'm giving you a bug and i i

595
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,960
exploded in happiness that was the best

596
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,480
feeling ever i was like

597
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,679
oh my no no no

598
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,000
this is not happening uh i don't know if

599
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,520
that's particularly interesting bugs

600
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,640
technically

601
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,400
um but for me that was like the

602
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,760
highlight of 2019 for me yeah

603
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,400
and i mean that's always like i remember

604
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
because i did a lot of social

605
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,559
engineering before

606
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,640
and i remember the first time i entered

607
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,480
like a building and got into it i was

608
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:22,960
like

609
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
i'm here i'm actually in and i'm a late

610
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,640
hacker now

611
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
yeah i'm buying the black hoodie i've

612
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,600
done it

613
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,200
it's such a great feeling amazing

614
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,039
so how about you others do you have any

615
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,360
particular i mean it doesn't have to be

616
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,080
like the coolest bug but the memory that

617
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,640
really

618
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,120
wow that was uh was a great uh great

619
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,520
moment

620
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,480
uh some of the stuff that i work on um i

621
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,000
work on stuff that other people

622
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,320
have already established vulnerabilities

623
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,000
so you'll find things like default

624
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,559
credentials and stuff like that um

625
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,880
recently went through a pro process of

626
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
reverse engineering a dvr which is

627
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,159
the brains of a cctv system and that was

628
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,919
pretty cool because i learned to

629
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,000
do an awful lot of different things and

630
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
attack vectors and what you'll find

631
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,039
within devices that you're still using

632
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:13,919
the same

633
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,919
pen testing methodology on these devices

634
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,200
but then there'll be a little bit of

635
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
extra things to do

636
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
um so one of the interesting things you

637
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,640
find remote back doors

638
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,280
um as well which is interesting um so

639
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,000
one of the

640
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,760
dvr boxes that i had had port 23 closed

641
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,480
um i had to walk away from the device

642
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,760
and that was at christmas and then a

643
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,360
couple months later

644
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,080
a very talented researcher vlad found a

645
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,400
way that you could pop it back open

646
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,120
and that was by running a script and

647
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,799
working with

648
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,720
its communication on its back door to

649
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,400
pop it open so then all of a sudden you

650
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
now have access to port 23 and you can

651
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,360
have remote control of the device itself

652
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,039
so that's been quite interesting and

653
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,600
then you find other devices where you'll

654
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,000
find

655
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,159
that they're having default credentials

656
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,200
but also

657
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,039
keeping hold of your credentials as well

658
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,480
so every time you're resetting your

659
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,080
password and changing it they'll keep a

660
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,280
copy on the device

661
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,520
so if somebody pawns your device not

662
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,640
only have they got

663
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
your device but they possibly have

664
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,039
passwords for all other devices because

665
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,480
you could reuse those passwords

666
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
somewhere else so that's that's

667
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,880
something that i'm working on at the

668
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,559
moment with a doorbell thing that i've

669
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,120
got

670
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,200
um but yeah there's always always fun

671
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,080
stuff to find

672
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,399
[Laughter]

673
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,679
yeah definitely how about you ask then

674
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,039
do you have anything particularly in

675
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,159
mind

676
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,679
yes uh it was outside of hackle one and

677
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,320
i

678
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
can't go into too much details but it

679
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
was an api

680
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
idor where you know i had two separate

681
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,679
accounts and i was like can i access

682
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,400
data from you know from account abc to

683
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,880
you know cde or whatever and i could i

684
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,320
could access the data and i could even

685
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
delete their data

686
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,480
and um that was not good but uh that was

687
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,640
it it was outside hacker one and that's

688
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,679
i

689
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,279
it was really exciting when i found that

690
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,360
out like yeah i love i love api

691
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
addresses my first one and my first

692
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,880
spray one i couldn't like publicly talk

693
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,400
about it

694
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,799
or go into details about it but you know

695
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,080
that's my only thing to face

696
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,799
amazing and and you alisa do you have

697
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,200
any

698
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,240
anything that comes to mind

699
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,720
it's not exactly a i'm like volability

700
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,400
reporter or whatever but it's a

701
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,760
you know build that i worked on for

702
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,919
detectify with the post secure

703
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,520
vulnerabilities that were you know first

704
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,400
talked about by

705
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,480
orange sci the the entirety of

706
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
the vulnerability the actual exploit

707
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,360
details weren't actually released at the

708
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,320
time

709
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,000
but i sort of found it interesting

710
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,080
enough to want to actually collaborate

711
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,279
with some other

712
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,520
security researchers to well i'll figure

713
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,440
out how the actual x-ray works in this

714
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,799
story will play on this

715
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,880
several day journey of um not only like

716
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,679
reverse engineering full secure like

717
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,200
files and things like that to understand

718
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
how it all works to

719
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,000
further find the vulnerability and how

720
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,919
to actually exploit it

721
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,000
this sort of led to you know developing

722
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,919
tools to um

723
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,640
exploit this vulnerability automatically

724
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,240
without any much effort

725
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,200
and they sort of looked to just

726
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
reporting on numerous um vulnerability

727
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
platforms at the time as

728
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,840
as though the vulnerability was patched

729
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,039
many many months ago

730
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,039
it was still vulnerable and many

731
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,480
websites have never actually

732
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,320
fully updated either and that's sort of

733
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,840
one of the things with vulnerability

734
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,799
programs in general

735
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,279
and i guess playground news too is that

736
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,799
a lot of companies will not exactly

737
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,559
update stuff as they should be and

738
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,400
you know even all vulnerabilities and

739
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,919
you can even find you know

740
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,279
websites they're still running very

741
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,600
outdated wordpress instances or plugins

742
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,039
that should have been updated

743
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,039
a long time ago and you know these sort

744
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,799
of vulnerabilities are also very

745
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,279
occurring alongside you know the the

746
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,159
actual

747
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,520
you know web applications they have that

748
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,200
might be vulnerable to

749
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,240
you know their own develop

750
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,520
vulnerabilities and things like that

751
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,600
so let's go in a little bit to uh to

752
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,480
diversity

753
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,640
and and hacking and in the in the

754
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,520
industry

755
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
uh when we talked a little bit earlier

756
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
uh ukc started to talk about the

757
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,720
differences when going from

758
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,360
one industry into another and i think

759
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,240
many of us

760
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,640
have have experienced we did that so can

761
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,520
you tell

762
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,880
tell a little bit more about your

763
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,559
experience with that yeah sure

764
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,640
so i've always worked in male dominated

765
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
industries um

766
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,760
and one of them has been when i used to

767
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,120
be a bodyguard

768
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,520
um now coming from an industry where

769
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,440
physical attributes do matter whether

770
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,039
you're a male or a female it's going to

771
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,960
have a physical ramification on

772
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,320
your abilities and how you do things um

773
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,120
it's interesting within that industry

774
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,919
the women

775
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,919
and myself were more respected because

776
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,400
we were able to do the same job

777
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,080
and moving into infosec i didn't feel

778
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,880
any different

779
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,919
i didn't see myself as a minority or in

780
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,360
any sort of negative way i've always

781
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,520
just cracked on and got the job done

782
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,480
um but one thing that i did notice is

783
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,120
that

784
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,279
we're in an industry where physical

785
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,279
attributes don't really matter because

786
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,799
the only thing that we do share

787
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,840
and what we need to use is our brain so

788
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,679
um i think with that in mind

789
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,760
we need to promote more inclusivity you

790
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,039
know what are the things that tie us

791
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,399
together what are the things that bind

792
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,200
us

793
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,279
as well as diversity as well i think

794
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,679
that would help

795
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,360
absolutely what do others think about

796
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,120
this and i mean it could be both

797
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
like things that are important to think

798
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,159
about but also

799
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,279
positive things with being a woman in

800
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,200
in in hacking or in tech

801
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,000
when we have discussions about diversity

802
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
and inclusivity

803
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,760
i think we get lost a little bit in this

804
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,360
idea that we should be

805
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
inclusive because it's a good thing to

806
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,039
do like it's a societal good

807
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,600
and that's absolutely true like not

808
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,159
having

809
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,760
women being able to enter a certain

810
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,520
field because of something that they

811
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,720
can't change

812
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
even if they're just as qualified as

813
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,559
their male counterparts is bad

814
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,000
but more importantly it's good business

815
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,640
when we think about um bug bounty and

816
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,320
security we need people who think

817
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,279
differently

818
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,200
we don't want people who all think the

819
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,279
same who have that same life experience

820
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,880
because they can't find interesting

821
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,240
security vulnerabilities they'll all

822
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,679
find the same thing

823
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,840
so having that diversity you know the

824
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
geographical diversity

825
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,039
um gender diversity any kind of

826
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,960
diverse way of thinking people have

827
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,159
different life experience

828
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,399
they're gonna find interesting stuff

829
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,480
because they all have this different way

830
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,440
of thinking

831
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,279
and i i often think we get sort of

832
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,559
caught up in

833
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,120
this is this is good because it's good

834
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,640
for society but you know what

835
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,760
it's good business yeah i

836
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,679
i absolutely agree and i think it's so

837
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,440
clear to see especially

838
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,399
uh when well take machine learning for

839
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,080
example it can vary it's very clear

840
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,559
sometimes that it's only white males who

841
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,480
have programmed it because it's built

842
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,600
for them and

843
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
they don't notice anything else because

844
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,039
it's of course i mean you only

845
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,799
it's so easy to see your own perspective

846
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,240
and forget everyone else

847
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,600
so to have all kinds of people

848
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,840
uh especially in hacking is important

849
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,039
because then you can

850
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,279
find things that the person who build it

851
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,399
would never even think about

852
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,919
yeah i also come from a uh i work in a

853
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,520
male-dominated industry as well i've

854
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,480
always have been

855
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,520
and i always find that not just diverse

856
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
in terms of you know gender and

857
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,039
ethnicity but also

858
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,279
backgrounds and where you are in the

859
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,080
world

860
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,559
uh so i'm on a team that's globally you

861
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,360
know just

862
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
distributed and when we all come

863
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,960
together we all have different

864
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,799
perspectives like katie mentioned and we

865
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,520
all

866
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,679
tackle the problem differently and that

867
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,279
works so well because then we can

868
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,640
actually get to resolution

869
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,559
quicker than if we were all thinking the

870
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,799
same or if it's just like

871
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,200
it's just that just differences just

872
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,919
actually helps move the needle further

873
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,559
definitely alyssa do you want to add

874
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,559
anything as well

875
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,960
it's something i've noticed when as when

876
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,480
i first started in the background

877
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,320
industry there wasn't really

878
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,279
many women in the field or bug values

879
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:17,760
itself

880
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
and part of the reason why i actually

881
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,039
got into the field was

882
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,200
primarily to at least in some way be

883
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,720
role model for other women in the

884
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,279
field that was at the time still very

885
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,360
much blossoming at the time

886
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,480
and looking at it now with many women in

887
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,679
the field now and

888
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,399
quite a lot of flavor events that are

889
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,080
you know showcasing women or helping

890
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,760
other women get into the field is

891
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,919
quite quite happy that we have um

892
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:42,880
something very

893
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,039
very wonderful to see yeah absolutely

894
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,600
so we're actually unfortunately starting

895
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,320
to run out of

896
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,880
time if i could choose which could

897
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,840
continue

898
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,200
the entire day but i thought

899
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,360
it would be nice if you all could leave

900
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,120
the people are listening with

901
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,440
some great advice or i mean one thing

902
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
that we didn't even touched upon was the

903
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,240
networking

904
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,720
and how to actually get out there so

905
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,919
maybe also have some

906
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,760
short advice on like a great conference

907
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,600
to go to or a great

908
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,440
community to go into apart from of

909
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,840
course hakuwan and detective 5.

910
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,360
any last words um

911
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,799
i'd like to pick up on the networking

912
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,880
part uh basically get to events when

913
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,840
when we can

914
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,360
um if you can't go to the in-person

915
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,159
stuff attend the online events because

916
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,679
it's the friendships and the bonds that

917
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,000
you make where you will find that you're

918
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,120
accelerating your learning um and you

919
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,519
can

920
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,200
make you know good bonds that would

921
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,880
actually help you career-wise um

922
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,320
but just for getting to know the

923
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,720
expert experts in the area because and

924
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,240
they're happy to help you as well

925
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,000
there's some really good guys within the

926
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,919
bug belt you've seen and outside who are

927
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,159
more than happy to to help you along the

928
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,039
way um

929
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,840
so yeah networking's very important

930
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,399
my number one advice when it comes to

931
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,919
learning something like

932
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,600
in bug bounty specifically is what i'm

933
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,360
gonna focus in on is

934
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,679
there are three steps to being a bug

935
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,880
bounty hunter

936
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,200
number one is to learn the tools number

937
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,279
two is to learn the vulnerabilities

938
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,279
and number three is to know where to

939
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,360
find them those are the three things you

940
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,799
need to learn if you want to

941
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,559
do this um and you can find all of that

942
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,279
for free online you don't need to pay

943
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,240
you don't

944
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,080
if you work better videos if you prefer

945
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,760
uh kind of live streams there is

946
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
something out there for you just focus

947
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,000
on those three things tools

948
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,640
vulnerabilities how to find them and how

949
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,279
to exploit them

950
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
my advice would be don't compare

951
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,480
yourself to anyone else

952
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
you know it's gonna sound the cheesy

953
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,919
thing it's a marathon

954
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,120
not a sprint or race you know um and

955
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,440
and during bug bounties uh it's a

956
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,399
learning process

957
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,159
and there's a learning curve where like

958
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,600
you know you're going really good and

959
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,120
then you dip a little bit and you're in

960
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,880
the valley of despair where you think

961
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,559
that you know nothing and that you

962
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,120
question your whole life choices don't

963
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,399
give up when you get there

964
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,399
keep going because that despair you're

965
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,159
actually learning and you're growing

966
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:25,840
so don't give up

967
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,799
alicia do you have any any final words

968
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,720
i guess the main thing is just be

969
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,960
persistent be willing to collaborate be

970
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,360
willing to ask for help from others

971
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,279
um primarily just be willing to push

972
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,240
yourself

973
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,360
and be willing to strive for what you

974
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,120
think you can't do because you might

975
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,239
end up surprising yourself

976
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,080
definitely so thank you so much

977
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,640
aspen katie chrissy and alyssa it's been

978
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
so interesting to listen to you

979
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,440
and i hope that everyone who listened

980
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,000
felt

981
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
feels the same because i felt i learned

982
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,679
a lot and got really really inspired so

983
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:17,839
thank you so much
