00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,200
welcome to our first ever

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,919
activity con it is more important than

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,040
ever before

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,120
for us to come together globally to

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,320
solve problems

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,960
you're from countries all over the world

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
fighting for a common goal

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,480
together so when hacker one approached

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
me about this keynote i was very excited

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,359
to say yes

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,199
i never really got as a kid like you

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,199
can't do this because you're a girl

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,519
you can't be in computers or girls don't

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,800
computer that

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
i don't remember ever hearing that but

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,000
did realize

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,760
that you know i wasn't necessarily like

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,520
other girls ever since i wrote my book

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,120
penetration testing a hands-on

21
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,800
introduction to hacking i've wanted to

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,320
make it easier for people to launch

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,640
their careers in information security

24
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
hi my name is stuck and this is my talk

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,120
from zero to nvh without knowing how to

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,680
write a

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,520
single line of python code i'm a father

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,280
husband hacker gamer and sometimes

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,800
streamer and we're gonna do

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,320
a little bit of an explanation of

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,920
finding your in scope domains right off

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,199
the bat what are your seed domains

33
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,120
what is this company's acquisition how

34
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,479
do you enumerate an asn

35
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,880
how do you do reverse whois enumeration

36
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,479
and subdomain enumeration and port

37
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,600
analysis what do you think of the

38
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,560
console form

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,119
i mean justin's freaking talk though

40
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,200
that graffana bug

41
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,439
mind-blowing mind-blowing so if you've

42
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,600
got an external image-only ssrf

43
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
you've got a full-read internal ssrf

44
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,439
that's a huge escalation

45
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,759
and this was the first time anybody has

46
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,600
publicly

47
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
shared a poc for this grafana

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
unauthorizated

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
ssrf

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,200
i've made a fair amount of bug bounty

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,320
finding

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,880
books in email systems or emails

53
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,920
themselves

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
and i hope to share some of this

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
information with you today this talk is

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,079
going to

57
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,960
be about my favorite hacks and mostly

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,000
it's going to be about

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
internal penetration testing these are

60
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
going to be my stories from the past

61
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,560
year or so

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,960
my name is robert i'm also known as not

63
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
the ghost and hacker one

64
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,119
i'm phillip and i'm known as kingcoid on

65
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,000
hacker1

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,280
we'll be focusing on xss

67
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,959
most of these laps can be easily

68
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,120
bypassed to achieve xss using some

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
common strategies which we will explore

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,840
today

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,599
there is some excitement when you kind

72
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,879
of break something that you really

73
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,360
shouldn't

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,080
i'm ian tabor or internet and this is my

75
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,200
car hacking talk

76
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,599
from an ivy in a box to a car in a box

77
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
drugs are illegal

78
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,680
and hacking something and getting that

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
high of finding a bug

80
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,640
and knowing oh my god i can't believe i

81
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,440
did that

82
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,680
this is incredible how do they develop

83
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,879
and let this in

84
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,920
the rush of it um is great

85
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,839
and that's why hack i love that feeling

86
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
we could walk through the scavenger hunt

87
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,239
that was hosted

88
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,319
if you can't go to the in-person stuff

89
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,319
attend the online events because

90
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,840
it's the friendships and the bonds that

91
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,159
you make where you will find that you're

92
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,680
accelerating your learning thank you so

93
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,720
much everybody for being here and

94
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
presenting at the first ever

95
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,159
hacker one activity con we had 18

96
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,239
amazing talks

97
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,239
1100 average viewers 5 000

98
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,760
or more unique viewers throughout the

99
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
day for both days now of course

100
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
the ctf was amazing when my co-founders

101
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,879
and i first set out on this journey we

102
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,319
had a vision

103
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,560
a vision of a future where vulnerability

104
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,640
disclosure will be ubiquitous and where

105
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
hackers become essential

106
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
for all who build and deploy software we

107
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
are breaking the mold of traditional

108
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
secrecy based security in the spirit of

109
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,120
learning

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
openness and collaboration so i wanted

111
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,720
to quickly say cheers

112
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,159
and thank you so much for being a part

113
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,319
of this and making the first activity

114
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,720
con

115
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:55,760
i guess it was cheers
