it's about burnout why is it called

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,960
active balance because

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,440
the reality of it is when we have our

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,719
personal life

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,719
and our work life when they're not in

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,280
balance that's when we get burned out

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
so this talk we're going to talk about

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,360
burnout

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,039
so first things first if you don't know

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,280
who i am my name is chloe mustaghi i'm

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,360
the vp of strategy over at 0.3 security

23

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,199
i'm also an ethical hacker advocate and

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,800
if you're wondering what is that

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,559
i'm someone who looks in the community

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,840
and asks the community

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,559
what are their needs and how can i help

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,920
and just by asking that

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
i work on trying to push for changes

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
when it comes to the media when they are

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
giving attention towards the hacker

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
community making sure that they know a

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,520
difference between a cyber criminal

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
and a hacker but also to try to work

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,520
with politicians to try to

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,159
change the legislation that we have i'm

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,759
not doing that i'm also thinking about

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,880
how can i increase diversity and

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,439

i'm always having my dms open

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
so what i want to first do is i want you

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,400
to imagine that you're driving in a car

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
now you're going to merge into the left

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,519
lane but

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,040
at this moment you're thinking to

73
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
yourself

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,760
should i even look in my mirror because

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,480
if i

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
you know if i don't look in my mirror

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,239
and there's a car behind me

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,239
i you know i might get an accident then

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,599
i don't have to do that task or

80
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,160
assignment and i could get out of it i

81
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
that means i don't have to go to work

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,519
maybe that means that i don't

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,120
i just don't have to do that project or

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
at least postpone that project

85
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,800
i cannot handle anymore so

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,319
i'm going to go through different

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,959
scenarios such as that one with you

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,879
and each one of these scenarios are

89
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
examples of burnout

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,680
um it used to take you for example in

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,640
this

92
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
screenshot it used to take you maybe a

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,840
few minutes or respond to an email now

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
it takes you 10 minutes to

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,120
an hour sometimes hours sometimes days

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,959
and you realize every email just seems

97
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,200
so hard to respond to even though it

98
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
used to take you hardly any time at all

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,239
this is usually my big sign when i'm

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,760
starting to feel like i'm getting burned

101
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,400
out

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,680
is that i get really behind on emails in

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,599
a sense where i don't have a zero inbox

104
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,920
anymore

105
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,000
another way you can start noticing your

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
burnout is when you have your family

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
your friends your colleagues

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
calling you or texting you and yet you

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
don't respond

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,760
for hours maybe days and

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
this is one of those things that you

112
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
know when you have a personal life and a

113
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,519
work balance situation

114
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,239
because we see people when you're burned

115
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:02,640
out

116
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,159
we see people as tasks so every person

117
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,239
who calls you is a task that you have to

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,280
complete

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,799
every time someone texts you it's

120
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,200
another task on top of your ever growing

121
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,760
list

122
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,199
of tasks and so keep that in mind as

123
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,440
well

124
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,759
another symptom of burnout is when you

125
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,880
have this suddenly

126
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,800
sense of maybe trappness or emptiness

127
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
or you feel like you can easily get

128
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
angry or easily get

129
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,320
sad just by looking at your tweets or

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,560
anything like anything can make you have

131
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,160
these sudden

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,600
urges of emotion or you procrastinate

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,840
i know many of us have okay let's raise

134
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,120
our hand yeah

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
and know those assignments back in

136
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
school

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
yeah we procrastinated but the thing is

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,440
that

139
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
also when you push out dates or you're

140
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,120
like oh well i could just do this some

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
other time

142
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,759
there's a real difference when you are

143
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
burned out is when

144
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,600
you are dreading and you can't sleep

145
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,199
because you have something to do but you

146
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,199
have no energy to work on it

147
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,919
and like i said no energy no matter how

148
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,440
many hours of sleep you get you just

149
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,240
feel so

150
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
tired you're so you just can't handle

151
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,759
how tired you

152
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
are now i just want to put out there if

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
you are feeling really tired no matter

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
how many hours of sleep you get

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
please go see your doctor because they

156
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,080
need to check your vitals

157
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,520
for example for myself i felt low energy

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,120
so i asked my doctor to check me for

159
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,320
iron and vitamin b and vitamin d

160
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
levels in my blood um and so it came

161
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,039
back that my iron levels are a little

162
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,440
bit low and so i just had to address

163
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,600
adding more iron to my diet and i

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
immediately within a few days saw

165
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,880
a huge burst of energy so make sure you

166
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,759
see a doctor

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
get your vitals checked if you're also

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,280
feeling tired

169
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
um this is always a good way to know

170
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
whether or not it's something going on

171
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
with mental health or it's a physical

172
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
body and because when you don't have

173
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,720
either one of those treated it affects

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
the other

175
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,240
so yes we're going to talk about burnout

176
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,720
and overall the big takeaway of burnout

177
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,600
is the feeling as if you have a battery

178
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,319
in you

179
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,240
that hasn't been charged and you're at

180
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,360
the very last

181
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
part of that percentage or the red like

182
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
in this image

183
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
and i just want to clarify once again i

184
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
am not a therapist but i have worked

185
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
with therapists

186
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,280
to help hackers um battle with burnout

187
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,000
because

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
our industry we're working 24 7

189
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
around the clock we don't really get

190
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
breaks and even when we want to take a

191
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,800
break we can't because we feel

192
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
guilty if we take a break because it's

193
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,000
going to put more pressure

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,319
on our team so i just want you guys to

195
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,240
know that i'm not a therapist but i have

196
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
worked with therapists to try to help

197
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,199
others and right now with covid19 even

198
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,840
though

199
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
we were dealing with burnout beforehand

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
a huge issue with that

201
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,520
it's getting much worse because now we

202
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
also have emotions involved and we're

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,919
working from home

204
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
so from what is burnout burnout is the

205
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
state of emotional physical

206
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,759
mental exhaustion caused by an excessive

207
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,039
prolonged stress

208
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,880
it occurs when you feel overwhelmed

209
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,319
emotionally drained

210
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,720
and unable to meet constant demands now

211
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
there is a quiz

212
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
link right down there and i want you

213
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
guys to be aware of that this works

214
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,319
really really well

215
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,560
if you're unsure if you like your job

216
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
now if you love your job you love the

217
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,199
work that you're doing

218
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
this quiz may not work for you um i just

219
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,639
want to let you know ahead of time on

220
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,080
that

221
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,160
but the good starter to see where you

222
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,520
lay when it comes to

223
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,360
if you're burned out now there's a

224
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
difference between a burnout and stress

225
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,639
that i would like to

226
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,599
iterate at this time stress is like oh

227
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,039
if i take a bubble bath

228
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,840
or i have a glass of wine i'm going to

229
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,240
feel

230
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
better now the thing is with burnout is

231
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
you could take all the bubble baths and

232
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,919
drink all the wine

233
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,039
but it's not going away um what it means

234
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,680
is that

235
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,199
you are you are just you need to take

236
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,240
a break like you just everything around

237
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,000
you you feel trapped you feel empty you

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
feel stuck

239
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,400
and that feeling of exhaustion

240
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,440
is burnout stress is different

241
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,479
stress is like you know go away

242
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,840
burnout is it can take a lot of time to

243
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,319
heal from

244
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,320
usually when we say how to prevent

245
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
burnout we usually go to

246
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,958
right away which is the exercise eat a

247
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,760
balance

248
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,240
diet practice good sleep habits ask for

249
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,958
help

250
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,200
those are all wonderful except we're

251
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,640
dealing with a pandemic

252
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,399
and it's very hard to do any of those

253
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,560
things and so i just want you guys to

254
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,360
know that

255
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,320
it's okay if you can't just try your

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,200
best on that

257
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,399
for example um you know

258
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,160
practice good sleep habits it's really

259
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
hard right now because i know many of us

260
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,320
are struggling with insomnia

261
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,120
because the thing is is that humans we

262
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
like to feel like we have control over

263
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,519
life

264
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,920
we like to have the sense that we can

265
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
predict what lies ahead

266
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,560
even though let's be real we never can

267
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,880
but

268
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
there's still a part of us that wants

269
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
that and so the thing is is that when

270
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,399
everything seems like it's out of our

271
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,600
control

272
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
and the world just seems like a mess

273
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
we're going to take on something

274
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
and it's definitely some emotional

275
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,279
turmoil because we're dealing with a

276
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,240
very surreal situation

277
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,040
exercise for example you can do that at

278
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,440
home

279
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
you can do jump jacks you can learn how

280
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,200
to do some awesome dance moves

281
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
you can eat a balanced diet as much as

282
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
possible but it's also hard if you can't

283
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,560
go to the grocery store as often

284
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,600
and that's okay um but honestly i think

285
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
the one main thing to take away from

286
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,760
here

287
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,480
is ask for help have that good

288
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
relationship with your manager

289
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,399
if you're employed or ask your friends

290
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,519
and family if you need support

291
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,959
so we're going to talk about how to

292
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,040
bounce back and now i should let you

293
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
know i have dealt with burnout many

294
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,240
times in my life

295
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
so i hope that these tricks help you

296
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,160
because they've helped me

297
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,000
the first thing is you have to be

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
self-aware you have to know if you're

299
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
feeling overly exhausted

300
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,320
in other words if you feel like it's

301
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
taking you more than a few minutes to

302
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,720
respond to an

303
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
email now it's taking you for such a

304
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,760
long time

305
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,079
or you purposely ignore phone calls and

306
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,600
text messages because you see them as

307
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,480
tasks

308
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,880
i think it's time for you to come to

309
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
some clarity which is

310
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
you might be dealing with some very

311
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
beginning burnout

312
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
if you ever feel the sudden sense of

313
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,519
trappedness

314
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,160
um also know that this is something to

315
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,560
be

316
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
concerned about so have that

317
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,079
self-awareness is going to be really

318
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,160
important and i really recommend

319
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
uh journaling and i know that sounds

320
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,079
kind of weird to do

321
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,880
as an adult but honestly journaling

322
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
every day or once a week even

323
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,959
can help you because you'll start seeing

324
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,279
patterns and when you start seeing those

325
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
patterns then you know exactly what you

326
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
need to start working on

327
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
so take this time to make a list of

328
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,959
things that you enjoy

329
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,680
outside of infosec and things that you

330
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
enjoy in infosec and just remind

331
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,079
yourself

332
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,680
that these are some positive things

333
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,120
going for you

334
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
um another way how to have that

335
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,399
experience of having some more

336
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,760
positivity in your day

337
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,279
is when you wake up think of three

338
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,040
things that you're grateful for

339
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
and when you go to sleep think of three

340
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,320
things that you're grateful for

341
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,680
or if you just do it once a day that's

342
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,600
totally okay but this is a really

343
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
important thing is to constantly remain

344
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,360
optimistic while we're in a really dark

345
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,920
time

346
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,360
and it'll help us out

347
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,519
now a lot of you guys know that i do

348
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,040
take bricks from my devices

349
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,680
i do this thing called device detox i

350
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,279
know it sounds like a goop thing but

351
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,320
it's not

352
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,959
um basically what i do is i take a break

353
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,399
from my devices

354
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,079
not saying that on the ground and

355
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,519
destroyed or thrown in the water because

356
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,040
there are times when i definitely

357
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
see tweets and i'm just like

358
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
everything's on fire i want to throw my

359
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,920
phone or my computer

360
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
but that's not what we should be doing

361
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,360
or thinking of

362
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
instead just turn it off um so i always

363
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,920
do this thing where i

364
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,639
make sure i take one day off a week

365
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,360
where i do

366
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,480
nothing infosec related um i highly

367
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,440
recommend it

368
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
if you could do it for a whole day do it

369
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,200
if not do it for like

370
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,680
four six or eight hours but just note

371
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,519
that when you turn off your devices get

372
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,279
off social media and everything

373
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,440
um make sure to let your loved ones know

374
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
that you're going offline from this hour

375
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,480
to that hour

376
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,200
so they're aware of it um this is

377
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
important for them to know that you're

378
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,480
trying to take care of yourself but also

379
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
for them to be aware of in case of

380
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,519
emergency you're not going to pick up

381
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,880
and you're not trying to ignore them

382
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,720
deliberately

383
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
now the thing to note is that if you are

384
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,959
broke out right at this moment which

385
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,760
many of you guys are i do recommend

386
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
taking more than one day

387
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,880
um i use a one day break a week

388
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,360
to recharge my batteries because i went

389
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,000
through

390
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,440
a good number of days for rest so

391
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
think about it this way take one day a

392
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,079
week to prevent burnout but if you're

393
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,519
dealing with burnout take

394
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,240
longer than one day i recommend doing

395
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,920
three days or more if you can

396
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,440
write it down is another great thing so

397
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,839
i

398
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,240
always keep a list with me at all times

399
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,320
okay and this list i write down my

400
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,360
personal

401
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,160
i do my work stuff on there like i have

402
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,399
a to-do list of anything that is a task

403
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,839
that goes through my mind that i need to

404
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,160
do

405
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,959
i write it down so then i freeze more

406
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,079
room in my head so

407
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,560
i can be more present for other things

408
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,079
because usually when we have a to-do

409
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,600
list that's like ever growing

410
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
we just kind of get in this moment where

411
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
we're not listening anymore we're just

412
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,519
focused on all the things we need to do

413
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,760
and this also um is an issue when it

414
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,880
comes to sleep

415
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,120
so when we're thinking right before bed

416
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
oh my god i have to do that thing or i

417
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,360
gotta send that email

418
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,440
that's gonna disturb your slave cycle

419
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,560
because you'll wake up in the middle

420
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,320
night or you'll wake up early because of

421
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,639
it

422
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,880
so just have it with you at all times

423
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,240
and write down whatever you need it

424
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,199
really does help

425
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,959
but also it feels amazing when you cross

426
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,720
it off so don't get too anxious when you

427
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,320
see the list because it also gives you

428
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,560
an

429
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
idea of how many things you've taken on

430
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
and maybe start thinking of ways how to

431
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,000
reduce that load

432
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,680
burnout is also a time for you to invest

433
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,920
examine your personal values and goals

434
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,800
and

435
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,440
and basically try to understand are you

436
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,000
happy

437
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,120
where you work right now and that's the

438
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,160
thing to think about

439
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,279
because you should have a supportive

440
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,519
environment no matter where you work a

441
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
good manager someone who wants to see

442
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,079
you go beyond them and if you don't have

443
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,519
that and you don't have that good

444
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
communication with a manager

445
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,519
it may be a time for you to switch a

446
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,839
manager or ask for a different manager

447
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,360
or it might be a good time to look

448
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,680
elsewhere and i know it's hard to find a

449
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,079
job

450
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,240
in the middle of a pandemic but honestly

451
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,600
we're also an infosec

452
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
and there's unlimited amounts of jobs

453
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
out there so keep the job that you have

454
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,240
but start

455
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,680
looking um and i also want to let you

456
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,279
guys know that

457
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
if you are dealing with the situation i

458
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,920
recommend telling your manager that

459
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,399
you're

460
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,639
you need to take a few days for personal

461
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,160
use

462
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,079
and i know some of us are like oh but

463
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,680
these are my holidays i

464
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,240
only get certain amount of days i don't

465
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,399
you shouldn't care about that don't hold

466
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:28,880
on to

467
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,519
these days as if they're like really

468
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,240
special

469
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,839
you should wait till the end of the year

470
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,519
or something like that don't do that

471
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,040
because let me tell you what happens

472
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,959
when you don't take time off

473
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,000
you put everyone else at risk that means

474
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,519
you put yourself at risk and by doing so

475
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,920
you're putting your work at risk because

476
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,680
other people are relying on you and how

477
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
can you deliver if you don't

478
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,199
have the energy to deliver on time or

479
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,440
be a hundred percent there and cognizant

480
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,480
of everything

481
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,000
because when we're burned out we're like

482
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,839
running on a two hour

483
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,880
sleep cycle so it's very hard and it

484
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,920
puts your entire security team at risk

485
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,480
so

486
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,160
talk to your manager about that make

487
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,279
sure that after you have that

488
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,000
conversation

489
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
send an email saying thank you for

490
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,600
meeting with me and all this and for

491
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
clearing in my few days keep a paper

492
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,680
trail everyone

493
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,399
i mean it um hr doesn't always have your

494
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:22,720
back

495
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
unfortunately and so this is a thing for

496
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
you to invest in yourself

497
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,639
by taking care of your needs and making

498
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,279
sure that

499
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,360
you are being counted for on your team

500
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,880
now i want to also let you know if

501
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
you're someone who's underrepresented

502
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
on your security team or in your office

503
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,959
chances are you're going to feel burned

504
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,320
out a lot faster than

505
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,160
most and the reason for that is because

506
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,920
you're constantly having to prove

507
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,320
that you deserve to be there and you're

508
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,440
going to be

509
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
scrutinized even more when you take time

510
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,839
off or whenever you do something that's

511
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,560
wrong

512
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,680
so the burnout level is a lot higher

513
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,120
and also it will come on a lot faster so

514
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
the best thing is really do a to-do list

515
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
prioritize

516
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,760
and have that good relationship with

517
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,039
your manager to let them know when

518
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,480
they're assigning new tasks that are not

519
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
part of your job

520
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,119
um and also when you do have flexibility

521
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,720
and free time and you see other people

522
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,799
on your team struggling

523
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,039
ask if they need any help and if you can

524
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,039
help because teams we work together

525
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,559
we don't work on our own always

526
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,799
last but not least the main takeaways

527
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,400
here is when you feel overwhelmed do a

528
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,080
device detox once again

529
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,600
take one day or more than four to six

530
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,640
hours a day once a week

531
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,080
just turn off everything that means get

532
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,720
off social media uh when you feel wrong

533
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
invest in yourself you need to do

534
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,000
something that's outside

535
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,080
infosec i really do mean this take one

536
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
day a week to do

537
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,240
something that is not infosec related

538
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,440
because you have a life

539
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,280
outside of infosec and i know that's

540
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,480
really hard to do

541
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,960
when you're a hacker and whatnot but you

542
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,720
need to invest in yourself outside of

543
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,679
infosec too

544
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,400
to keep your sanity um when you feel

545
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,039
overwhelmed

546
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
ask for help really ask your friends

547
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
family or colleagues your manager

548
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,559
ask for help we will never get to where

549
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,400
we need to go in life if we don't ask

550
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,960
for help

551
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,679
and if we don't help others also when

552
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,200
you feel overwhelmed write it down

553
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
journal like write a to-do list is going

554
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,480
to help you out

555
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,320
when you feel overwhelmed take a break

556
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,679
like i said if you

557
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,440
feel like you want to prevent burnout

558
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,320
take one day a week off of all devices

559
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,080
or take time off from devices um

560
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
now if you already are experiencing

561
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,919
burnout i do recommend taking more than

562
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,280
three days off

563
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,880
to try to recharge your batteries and

564
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,960
for some it'll take a whole week

565
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,480
sometimes two weeks so keep that in mind

566
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,160
when you feel overwhelmed put yourself

567
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
first you cannot help another individual

568
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,520
when you are not doing well yourself and

569
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,039
i know that's one of those things i like

570
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,280
but i want to keep helping people

571
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,919
don't help someone out you it's like the

572
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:00,480
energy

573
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,039
that you have is so small when you're

574
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,160
burned out

575
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,880
that you need to use it for yourself to

576
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,799
recharge your own battery so then you

577
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,880
can be there and be a better supportive

578
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,679
person

579
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,760
because if you help anyone else it's not

580
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
going to be a full you

581
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
it's going to be a partial you and

582
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,640
helping so

583
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,799
keep that in mind i know we feel

584
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,880
guessing when we take breaks or when we

585
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,440
take time off but it's needed

586
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
um last night at least please note that

587
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,720
you are not alone

588
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,640
you should never feel isolator alone in

589
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,559
the hacker commute we are there for

590
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,360
each other um i wouldn't be where i am

591
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
if it wasn't for everyone

592
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,799
in this community and probably the same

593
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,520
for you as well

594
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
and most importantly always ask the

595
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
question am i balancing my work and

596
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,720
personal life

597
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,919
if not it's time to take steps to fix it

598
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,440
because that means you've already

599
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,200
started to go towards the burnout or

600
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
already in burnout

601
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,679
last but not least i wanted to thank you

602
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,679
guys so much for existing

603
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,520
and for being part of the bug bounty

604
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
community i have to admit

605
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,080
it is such an honor to work with many of

606
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,640
you guys

607
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,400
and also to be part of the bug bounty

608
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,480
community if it wasn't for bug bounty

609
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,400
and vulnerability disclosure

610
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,120
we would be so far behind as a hacker

611
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,919
community

612
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,320
because it is really the bug-bound

613
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,960
community

614
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,520
and the voter b disclosure community

615
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,120
both of them are actually together to be

616
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,080
honest

617
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,400
that has changed the way that people

618
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,440
view hackers

619
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
and it's about time that people start

620
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,919
seeing us as people that are good

621
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,120
and that are the everyday heroes um so

622
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
once again thank you guys over at

623
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,600
