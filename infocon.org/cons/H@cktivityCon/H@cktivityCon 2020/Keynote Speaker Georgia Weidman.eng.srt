00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,960
hi everyone i'm georgia weedman and i'll

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,719
be your keynoter today

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,040
first off i need to thank hacker one

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,880
ever since i wrote my book penetration

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
testing a hands-on introduction to

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
hacking i've wanted to make it easier

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,760
for people to launch their careers in

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,039
information security

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,480
so when hacker one approached me about

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,320
this keynote and suggested that i talk

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
about my own career journey

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
i was very excited to say yes this is

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
something i've wanted to talk about for

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
a while hopefully you guys can take my

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,160
career journey

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
and apply it to your own career at least

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,239
in some ways obviously there'll be some

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,760
differences but hopefully

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,840
it'll resonate in some ways at least

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680
without further ado i suppose we should

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
get started

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,079
so i guess there's really like two

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,200
stories right there's

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
hero's journey and there's the romance

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,520
i'm not really ready to call myself a

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,559
hero per se

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,000
maybe anti-heroine

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
as for the romance you know it's boy

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
meets girl boy loses girl

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
boy learns some stuff and evolves and

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
hopefully gets the girl back

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
well i am a girl so we'd have switched

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
that and you know as we'll talk about in

35
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,119
just a minute i've never been really

36
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,080
great with people

37
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
so instead of it being you know about

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
boy and girl let's make it about a girl

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,000
and a horse

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
and speaking of horses this is one of my

41
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
horses from when i was a kid

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,000
this is tristan and i learned from

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
tristan that even though i couldn't

44
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,240
understand

45
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,479
people all that well i could understand

46
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,799
horses and i could relate to them

47
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,520
and on top of that i learned that i love

48
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,079
winning

49
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,439
you may be able to see some of my

50
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,600
ribbons behind me i still love winning

51
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,720
competition

52
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,119
all that is a lot of fun for me and i

53
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,280
learned that you know while i may not be

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,360
you know the tallest or the thinnest or

55
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,560
the smartest or

56
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
you know any of those things with hard

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,159
work and dedication

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
and just not giving up i can succeed at

59
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,040
what i try to do

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,399
so i learned that from the horse

61
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,040
competitions as a kid and that has

62
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,119
helped me for it through my entire

63
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,960
career that has been i think if there

64
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,479
was one thing it was

65
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,439
you know don't give up work hard carry

66
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,440
on and you know that will

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
be nine tenths of the way to success

68
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,959
most of the time so

69
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
i encourage you all to do the same as

70
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,239
hard as it may be sometimes

71
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,200
so i'm from rural mississippi i've

72
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
pointed it out on the map for you

73
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,040
if those of you who are not familiar

74
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
with it what

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
you know despite mississippi i actually

76
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
had a lot of things going

77
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,599
for me i'm from a town called madison

78
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,280
it's pretty small

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,560
around the time i was born there was

80
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
like 7 500 people

81
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
and it's really boomed since then and

82
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
it's doubled in size there's about 15

83
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,920
000 people there now

84
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
but it was relatively well to do well

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,440
for mississippi

86
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,760
the schools were pretty good again for

87
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
mississippi i can read

88
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,959
i'm allowed to say that because i'm from

89
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,040
mississippi anyway and the biggest thing

90
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,519
for me was my mother actually had a phd

91
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,040
in computer science she got it when i

92
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,080
was like three

93
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
so that's some of my first memories is

94
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,840
her doing you know the computer stuff

95
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,560
for her

96
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
dissertation and that was a big deal for

97
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,920
me

98
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,560
because i never really got as a kid like

99
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
you can't do this because you're a girl

100
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
you can't be in computers or girls don't

101
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,319
computer that

102
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,080
i don't remember ever hearing that and

103
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,599
if i had heard it it would have just

104
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
like gone right over my head because

105
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,200
in addition to having that role model

106
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
for my mother you know her other friends

107
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,519
were

108
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,000
you know women in stim as well so i

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,599
would have known that that was nonsense

110
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,040
and i know that you know a lot of young

111
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,519
women

112
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,959
other minorities don't get that they

113
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,640
don't get that role model that

114
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
that looks like them in their you know

115
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,840
career field so

116
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,480
i was really lucky in that way for sure

117
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,599
but

118
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,599
i did realize that you know i wasn't

119
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,440
necessarily like other girls or

120
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
even like boys for that matter but i

121
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
didn't really know why

122
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
i actually didn't know why until i was

123
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,959
an adult even after you know

124
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,560
psychiatrists had

125
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,920
mentioned autism as a possibility for me

126
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,599
it just didn't really resonate because a

127
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,920
lot of the literature even today

128
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,720
is based entirely on studies of of boys

129
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,280
and men

130
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,120
so there wasn't really a lot that

131
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,720
necessarily spoke to me

132
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
for instance you know special interest

133
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
is a big thing with autism

134
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
and you know i was obsessed with horses

135
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
as a kid but

136
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,358
i guess that's kind of normal for a girl

137
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,639
all girls are supposed to be obsessed

138
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,839
with horses but

139
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,759
you know it was really the same thing as

140
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,680
a obsessive special interest

141
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,919
for for a boy just no one noticed

142
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,600
because it was horses and i was a girl

143
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,080
and that was

144
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
cool anyway so i read this book as a

145
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,639
young adult called aspergirls by rudy

146
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,600
simone

147
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,919
if you happen to be a female on the

148
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,759
spectrum or think you might be or

149
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
you know might love someone who is i

150
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
would definitely

151
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,240
recommend this book because it was

152
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
really an aha moment for me it was like

153
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,320
okay that's me and then i gave it to

154
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,680
everybody i know and i'm like yeah

155
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,320
that's you

156
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,639
totally so that made a lot of sense for

157
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,240
me and kind of put a lot of the pieces

158
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,520
together about like

159
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,759
why i kept screwing up with people as

160
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,440
hard as i tried

161
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
but there is kind of the trope of if

162
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,320
you've met a person with autism that's

163
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
exactly what you've done you've met

164
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,320
a person with autism because we are very

165
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
different

166
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,800
and the way i have my autism expressed

167
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,120
and

168
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
understood is possibly very different

169
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,039
from how if you're on the spectrum as

170
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,520
well

171
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
it might be very different from yours or

172
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,039
again if you have loved ones or anything

173
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,560
like that on the spectrum

174
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
you know it's it's possibly very

175
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
different but for me

176
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,919
it really comes around to i don't

177
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,280
understand people at all

178
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,320
you know your gestures and your

179
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,479
intonations

180
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,720
and all that stuff you do i have spent

181
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,919
my entire life

182
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,400
trying to mimic and understand it but

183
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,520
i'm still

184
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,919
i get it so wrong sometimes and things

185
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,600
like knowing when to talk

186
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
you know if i talk for too long people

187
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,960
get annoyed

188
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,880
or you know if there's a pause and i'm

189
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,039
supposed to talk then

190
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,160
i don't catch it and they get annoyed

191
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,000
so i kind of go to well i just won't

192
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,160
talk at all i'll just ignore people

193
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,240
and be by myself and then people think

194
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,479
i'm a jerk and they're annoyed with me

195
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,880
and that bothers them too so you know it

196
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,600
really

197
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
has not gone very well a lot of the time

198
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,960
but

199
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,800
understanding that you know i do have

200
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
you know a condition and it's not just

201
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,360
me

202
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,759
you know being lazy or being a jerk has

203
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,440
gone a long way

204
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,840
for you know my understanding of myself

205
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
at the very least

206
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
additionally you know i really like

207
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
structure and

208
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,039
concreteness things like jokes and

209
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,319
abstraction are

210
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,360
often somewhat lost on me but i think

211
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,639
the biggest thing for me

212
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,919
is that i have had to develop

213
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,880
a lot of coping skills i had somebody

214
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,240
say on the internet once because you

215
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,520
know people say stuff about you on the

216
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
internet and it sticks with you

217
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
i had someone say that i didn't have a

218
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,479
lot of coping skills

219
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,880
so a mentor of mine made me this this

220
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,080
great picture

221
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,039
and this is i guess a coping saw and

222
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,560
there's some skills in it so

223
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,120
now i have many coping skills but i have

224
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,680
had to develop these coping skills

225
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,960
as i've gone through my life and

226
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
continue to develop them

227
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,759
today but i'm certainly i think doing a

228
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,360
lot better than when i started

229
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,240
at the very least

230
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,120
but i think the big one for me is eye

231
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,639
contact

232
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,880
eye contact for me and a lot of other

233
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,000
autistic people that i've

234
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,639
talked to it hurts if you've ever read

235
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,479
or seen the movie of dune

236
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,639
when you know early on paul has to put

237
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,400
his hand like in the box

238
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
and if he takes it out he's gonna get

239
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
killed but he thinks like when they let

240
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,720
it out

241
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,639
it's gonna be all burnt off in a stump

242
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,240
because it hurts that bad

243
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
and the fact that he can stand it it's

244
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,599
like proof that he's gonna save the

245
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,199
universe

246
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,759
that's what looking in people's eyes

247
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,639
does for me

248
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,280
it really hurts so one of the coping

249
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,000
skills i

250
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,599
developed because if you just like don't

251
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,520
look at people's eyes they

252
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,199
you know think you're not interested i

253
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
think you're a creep you know

254
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
all sorts of different things bad things

255
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,000
happen to you if you don't if you're for

256
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,280
instance trying to

257
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,759
sell a product to a customer or raise

258
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,800
venture capital

259
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
and you're not looking at the person

260
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
that generally doesn't go very well

261
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,520
so a coping skill i have developed is

262
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
looking at people's foreheads

263
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
and i find that no one can tell that i'm

264
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,759
doing it and it's a lot more comfortable

265
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,000
for

266
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
me and it works out pretty well

267
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,319
and another one if any of you happen to

268
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,440
be nearsighted

269
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
this works really well for me in things

270
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,560
like stages

271
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
and well i'm not on a stage now but i

272
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,479
would be if i was actually there

273
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,319
but you know if you guys were actually

274
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,680
in the audience for me

275
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
one thing that i do is i don't wear my

276
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,799
glasses on stage

277
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,958
so i actually can't see anything but

278
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,279
just blobs so people could be sleeping

279
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,240
or making

280
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,120
faces or you know doing whatever and i

281
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,799
would just see nothing but a blob

282
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,399
so as long as the person isn't like

283
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
right here even in a conference room

284
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
setting you know i'm able to you know

285
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
look like i'm looking at them intently

286
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
when i can't really see their face

287
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
so you know if you happen to be

288
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
nearsighted and autistic

289
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,160
something maybe to consider and now none

290
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,640
of you

291
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
will ever be able to tell whether i can

292
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
really see you or not

293
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,680
so who knows so let's talk a little bit

294
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
about my early life

295
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,480
i was i guess the word for it now is

296
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
bullied i was bullied a lot i didn't

297
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
know i had autism

298
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,440
i knew there was something different

299
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
about me i think a lot of people thought

300
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,120
you know i was just a jerk or not trying

301
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
or just straight up weird you know how

302
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,640
kids can be about those sorts of things

303
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,200
so

304
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,040
you know i i did not succeed socially in

305
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,560
my early life shall we say

306
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,920
so my decision was that i was going to

307
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,320
go to college after the eighth grade

308
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
so i did i went to the program for the

309
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
exceptionally gifted at mary baldwin

310
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,839
college when i was 14

311
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,320
and i graduated when i was 18. this is a

312
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
picture of me in college i

313
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,760
definitely stole that costume from the

314
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,000
like theater department trailer that was

315
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
behind my dorm one year and i love it i

316
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
wish i still had it but i'm sure i gave

317
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
it back like a good person

318
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,920
anyway so i got a math degree i didn't

319
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
want to do computer science because i

320
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,959
didn't want to be like my mother because

321
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,640
i was who wants to be like their parents

322
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,760
when they're like 16

323
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,519
most teenagers don't so i was going to

324
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,079
do math and then i was applying around

325
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,519
to math grad schools

326
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,240
and i quickly realized that i was not

327
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,000
going to be einstein

328
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
and i probably didn't want to spend my

329
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,079
life teaching pre-calculus

330
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,640
to you know people who probably didn't

331
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
even want to be there at community

332
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,519
college so

333
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,519
i decided maybe i needed another career

334
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,200
path but as a fun fact

335
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
university of virginia rejected me as a

336
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
graduate student

337
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
but last year they actually invited me

338
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
back to be

339
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,279
a guest lecturer for the computer

340
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,720
science department so

341
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,200
you know i got the last laugh in that

342
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
that part because

343
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
you know i wasn't good enough to be a

344
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,279
student but now i'm cool enough to be a

345
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,320
guest lecturer

346
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
i didn't actually apply at oxford but

347
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
i'm sure they would have rejected me as

348
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,279
well but

349
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,600
earlier this year i actually went and i

350
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,279
was a guest lecturer for the cyber

351
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,519
security phd program at the university

352
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,959
of oxford so

353
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,920
you know all my academic failings aside

354
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
i think that has worked out pretty well

355
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,480
for me

356
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,360
in the end so again i got the last laugh

357
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
on that

358
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,839
so i i did end up doing computer science

359
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
i did end up becoming my mother

360
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,760
just like i hoped i wouldn't but you

361
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
know as i've matured more i've seen that

362
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,680
you know following in the career

363
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,519
footsteps of my mother in the computer

364
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,240
sciences

365
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,399
was not a bad idea after all so i went

366
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,600
to graduate school

367
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,440
and in computer science and there was

368
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,040
this thing called the

369
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
cyber defense club and i didn't know

370
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,240
anything about cyber defense all i knew

371
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,839
about hacking was that that was how you

372
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,120
go to jail and

373
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,880
i didn't figure with my social skills i

374
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
would fare very well in prison

375
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,399
so i figured that was probably not the

376
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,880
career path for me but

377
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,279
the captain of the cyber defense club

378
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,160
well

379
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,200
let's just say he was um interesting

380
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,279
so i decided to join the cyber defense

381
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,320
club

382
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
and we did this thing called the

383
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,000
collegiate cyber defense competition

384
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
they have them all over

385
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
if you're a college student i would

386
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
definitely encourage you to look them up

387
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
it is possibly the worst three days of

388
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,040
your life as a student you are

389
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
a blue team member you know the

390
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,240
network's under attack by

391
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
real attackers actually you know pin

392
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,519
testers by day

393
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,920
volunteering to do this you've got a ceo

394
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,440
that hates you they want you to put up

395
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
new services

396
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
everything is just awful it's probably

397
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
the worst like i said the worst blue

398
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
team situation you'll ever find yourself

399
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,440
in

400
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
but it's also a lot of fun and from that

401
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,959
competition i realized this is what i

402
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
want to do with my life not be a blue

403
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
team member by any means

404
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,480
but i wanted to be the red team i wanted

405
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,200
to be those

406
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,279
those pin testers that were on the other

407
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,959
side and

408
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,959
well as for the boy since you know we

409
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,120
were talking romance about this

410
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,560
that didn't work out so well i

411
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,160
definitely didn't get the boy he's

412
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,079
married to the girl he was dating then

413
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,760
so i don't think he ever gave me a

414
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,440
backward glance honestly

415
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,519
but that's okay i may not have gotten

416
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,560
the guy but

417
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,800
i found my career path so it was

418
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
definitely a net positive

419
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
though thanks to him i found you know my

420
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,680
future

421
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
so that worked out pretty well so i

422
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,720
graduated from

423
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,920
from grad school and i had tons of job

424
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
offers just because i had a computer

425
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,200
science masters like

426
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,760
all of the the government contractors

427
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,200
they didn't care whether i knew anything

428
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,560
about security just

429
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
the fact that i had a master's degree in

430
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,079
security so i get all these emails all

431
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,240
the time like how do i get into security

432
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,000
and i always feel bad because i feel

433
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,839
like i kind of cheated because i didn't

434
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,040
really when i

435
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,639
you know i knew a bit from the cyber

436
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
defense club but comparatively to

437
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,360
i guess probably what i needed to know i

438
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,880
didn't really know anything i just had a

439
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,000
piece of paper

440
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
so again i feel like i kind of cheated

441
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
but that was my way into security i got

442
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,800
a degree

443
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,560
and then they just came and hired me

444
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
but i wasn't really happy with the kind

445
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,760
of job that i had

446
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,920
i was doing blue team for the government

447
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,800
but

448
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,959
it really amounted to i was helping

449
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,880
people update their itunes

450
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,959
and being told no like when i found the

451
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,959
vulnerability like you know basic stuff

452
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,480
that you find with the scanner like

453
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,760
missing patches

454
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
oh we can't patch that because it would

455
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,480
break this and i had no authority to

456
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,720
tell them they had to so you know it was

457
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,560
really kind of a lost cause sort of

458
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,519
thing

459
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,279
and i wanted more i really wanted to

460
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,199
make the world a better place save the

461
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,760
world with security and things like that

462
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,160
and i obviously was not getting that in

463
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,600
my current job so

464
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,320
i was looking to other cyber security

465
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,880
people

466
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
and you know i saw that they were giving

467
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
talks at conferences

468
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,720
all the time doing research giving talks

469
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
and they had jobs where you could work

470
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,560
from home which sounded great to me

471
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,760
because you know people

472
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,160
autism this was around the time i found

473
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,760
out i actually had autism

474
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,320
and had a reason for all this you know

475
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,600
angst about

476
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
people but certainly working from home

477
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,199
would be fun

478
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,839
and also getting to do actual pen

479
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,839
testing work and you know make the world

480
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,480
a more secure place so i decided okay

481
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,279
i'll do some

482
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,560
security research i did a little project

483
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,959
on text message botnets you know before

484
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,000
they were popular

485
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,320
nowadays that's you know the cool way to

486
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,519
spam but

487
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,279
you know i thought it was fairly

488
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,920
interesting so i did that and i

489
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
submitted it to a small local conference

490
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,279
called shmukon little did i know that it

491
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,480
was one of the you know

492
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
most prestigious cyber security

493
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,399
conferences in the world

494
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,279
and i'll never know why but the review

495
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,959
team decided to let me in

496
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,079
with my five months of experience in

497
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,399
computer security at that point

498
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,519
and yeah

499
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,920
though i got the like time slot right it

500
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,959
was noon

501
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,279
on sunday which if you've ever been to

502
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,560
one of these conferences

503
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
saturday night is a really big party

504
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,399
night so noon on sunday is

505
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,680
maybe not the best time ever so i

506
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,600
figured it wouldn't be particularly well

507
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,560
attended

508
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,920
but what i did was i had a little red

509
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320
wagon and i filled it with beer

510
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
and i walked around saying there was

511
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,399
gonna be free beer at my talk i even had

512
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,240
this little free beer sign

513
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,759
and i filled that room guys

514
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,480
so i guess use whatever tools you have

515
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,759
be it free beer or

516
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,920
otherwise to get what you want cause

517
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,759
some people saw my talk and

518
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
some of them recommended me to other

519
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,079
conferences and that started my speaking

520
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:18,639
career

521
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
so i guess the lesson learned from that

522
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,320
is

523
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
you know in hindsight it was very naive

524
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,079
of me and perhaps a little arrogant to

525
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,600
be like oh i've never given a talk

526
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
ever i'm just gonna submit it to like

527
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,519
one of the really hard to get into

528
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,040
conferences that's like really

529
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,360
prestigious but

530
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,680
i don't think you should ever say no for

531
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,360
other people it's really easy to it's

532
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,720
really easy to be like oh they're gonna

533
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
laugh when they see this there's no way

534
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,240
they'd take me

535
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,000
but people are gonna tell you no plenty

536
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
in your career never say no

537
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
for them so be naive be arrogant put

538
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,320
yourself out there for things that

539
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,160
you don't actually if you stop and think

540
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
about it feel like you're even qualified

541
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,480
to do

542
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
because it might work out really well

543
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,399
for you like it did for me because i

544
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,600
went from here to

545
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,279
i was giving talks all over the world i

546
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,720
started doing training

547
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
i got that job that i wanted working

548
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,720
from home and doing pin testing you know

549
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,439
things were

550
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,400
definitely looking up for me then there

551
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
was this thing called the darpa cyber

552
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,000
fast track i really wish they still had

553
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,559
this

554
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,559
darpa cyber fast track was basically if

555
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,160
you guys have ever done any

556
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,079
like government grant stuff you

557
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,919
basically have to have somebody whose

558
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,119
job is to do the paperwork because it's

559
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,720
really involved and you just have to

560
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,120
know

561
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
all the right stuff to do it it takes a

562
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,039
long time for it to go through and a lot

563
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,840
of paperwork

564
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,760
cyber fast track was not like that i

565
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,600
think i turned it in on a wednesday

566
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
and i got it the next monday and it was

567
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
like a seven

568
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,120
page application as opposed to probably

569
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
700 for

570
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,120
your normal government grant so it was

571
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,919
aimed at

572
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
you know hackers giving them government

573
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
financing to do their research

574
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
and again this was naivety and

575
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
a little bit of vanity being like oh

576
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,039
cyber fast track

577
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,840
i've got what 18 months of experience

578
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,400
now

579
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,760
i can totally do that so i submitted

580
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,280
i got it funny story i lost my job

581
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,240
over it because they didn't want me to

582
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
do it and have the job so

583
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,720
i mean how hard can it be let's just

584
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,400
start my own company

585
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
so i started my own company started

586
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
doing like pin testing gigs and other

587
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,919
consulting doing my training through

588
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,720
there

589
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
and i had government money so it was

590
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,240
cool well

591
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
i kind of had government money because i

592
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,240
actually had to invoice them in order to

593
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,200
get the money

594
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,520
and i didn't know what an invoice was so

595
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,120
actually today i still

596
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,360
use the invoice template for both my

597
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,160
companies

598
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,240
that the darpa cyber fast track sent me

599
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,679
when i was like i don't know what that

600
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,400
is

601
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,799
to get my money so again you know don't

602
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,320
say no for anybody else submit the

603
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,080
things that you don't think they'll even

604
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,360
consider you for

605
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,280
that's how i did my smartphone pintest

606
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
framework i got to speak at all the

607
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
you know black hats and defcons and

608
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
things like that

609
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,640
i got into backtrack you know before

610
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,559
cali there was backtrack so i had a tool

611
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,160
and backtrack everything was coming up

612
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
roses for me

613
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,000
around the same time i got approached to

614
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,799
write a book

615
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,080
everybody thought i was gonna do a

616
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
mobile book and again i'm like got two

617
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,760
years experience maybe now

618
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,160
totally qualified to write a book about

619
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,440
my subject

620
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
but i didn't write mobile i really

621
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,880
wanted to write this book

622
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,559
that is specifically aimed at beginners

623
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,160
i really wanted to write the book that i

624
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
wished i'd had so i didn't have a lot of

625
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,080
mentors when i was coming in

626
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,919
maybe it was a social skills thing

627
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,000
mainly but you know when i had

628
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
questions i there was nobody i could

629
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,440
really ask about it

630
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
so i really wanted to write this book

631
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,559
because it was a book

632
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,559
i wished i'd had and so other people

633
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,080
could have it you know as they were

634
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,440
trying to come up and

635
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,840
you know from the results that i've

636
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,360
gotten at least you know from the people

637
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
that i've heard from

638
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
it has helped a lot of people get in and

639
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,039
that makes me really happy

640
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,039
and i'm supposed to talk about like

641
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,799
things about the next book the next book

642
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,720
is coming i know i get a thousand emails

643
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,280

644
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,360
like when is it coming out it is coming

645
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,400

646
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,039
i have a really good easter egg for you

647
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,520
guys

648
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280

649
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,039
i'll put it out you know the day this

650
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,400
talk comes out

651
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,039
and you know i guess as a little teaser

652
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,400
for it

653
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,080
you know the lab for the first book has

654
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,240
not aged very well and

655
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,159
i really wanted to fix that problem for

656
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
the second book and i have fixed it in a

657
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
wonderful way with a great partnership

658
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,960
with you know someone who is you know in

659
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,120
the business of doing online labs and

660
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,360
it's gonna be awesome so definitely

661
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,640
check that out

662
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,880
and let's carry on for now but check

663
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,840
that out

664
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,520
so everything's going great right so

665
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,120
everything has to go horribly wrong

666
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,240
right sometimes

667
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,960
life just bucks you off in my case since

668
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,480
i'm a horseback rider

669
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,840
and i got bucked off big time

670
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,120
so it all started really with poland so

671
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,640
in poland

672
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,080
you can read about it on the internet

673
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,000
but i have my coffee cup

674
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,840
so basically what happens is i got it

675
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,520
attacked attempted raped by

676
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,280
another speaker this was back in 2013 so

677
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,880
before me too

678
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,679
and so i actually came out of it

679
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,120
thinking like

680
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
i did well this was a horrible

681
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,720
experience but i got myself out of it

682
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,080
this guy tried to rape me and i

683
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
bashed his head in with a coffee cup i

684
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
actually still have the coffee cup

685
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
sorry hotel in poland yes i did steal

686
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,080
your coffee cup

687
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,559
but it was what came after you know i

688
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,159
got a lot of

689
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,840
people didn't believe me people said

690
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,600
stuff like i was too ugly to rape so i

691
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,440
had to be making it up

692
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,480
or i was just crazy and had i guess

693
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
hallucinated the whole thing

694
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,280
and people that i i thought that

695
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,080
you know by doing well in security i had

696
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,960
finally found

697
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,000
like a tribe or a community in

698
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,280
infosec and after this i realized that

699
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,360
maybe that wasn't so much the case

700
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,440
and i think that was the part that was

701
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,600
the hardest and

702
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,919
afterwards it was things like being in a

703
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,320
crowded room were stressful and oh

704
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,360
that's conferences

705
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,440
isn't it and you know i felt like i was

706
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,600
having trouble working but i felt like

707
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,760
well i wasn't raped this wasn't actually

708
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,960
so bad

709
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,039
so i don't really have any right to like

710
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,640
have this traumatic

711
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
response to it or if i do then

712
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,679
i am crazy and the guy was right and it

713
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,440
kind of went into this circular thinking

714
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,039
so it kind of went off the rails a

715
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,240
little bit

716
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
and it wasn't fun so

717
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,840
let's just carry on but you know i get

718
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,240
the last laugh in the end right because

719
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,919
this was also about the time my book was

720
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,919
coming out and you know everything kind

721
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,080
of came to a head at derbycon that year

722
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,480
like

723
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,080
my class did not go that well it was

724
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,760
but it's funny because the week after

725
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,440
that i went to europe and did a class

726
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,120
and got like perfect reviews so i wish i

727
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,799
could switch those because derby con was

728
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,840
always my favorite

729
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,200
and i feel like that was the moment

730
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
where the community like entirely turned

731
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,240
on me

732
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,559
and then my book was coming out and

733
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,240
there were it hadn't even come out yet

734
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,760
there were already reviews about how

735
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,960
awful it was

736
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,559
like coming out and people were writing

737
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,400
about how terrible it was and

738
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,720
yeah it was not the launch that i had

739
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,760
hoped for

740
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
you know in hindsight with all the sales

741
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
that we've had and we're in five

742
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,440
languages now and how many people are

743
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
waiting to see the second edition

744
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,320
you know it doesn't you don't really

745
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
remember that when the actual launch

746
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,520
happened it was terrible

747
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
so what did i decide to do i decided to

748
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
stick my tongue out

749
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,039
at infosec like one of my horses is

750
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,159
doing here and

751
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,039
i left i left the community and i went

752
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,000
and did

753
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,200
a startup accelerator called mach37 so i

754
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,120
decided well i'll go learn more about

755
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,240
business well

756
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,000
part of it was i needed to learn more

757
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,760
about business because a lot of my

758
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,320
income

759
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,120
had been from conferences and training

760
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,240
and things like that

761
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,919
so since everybody hated me in the

762
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,360
community and weren't gonna

763
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,320
book me anymore then i guess i had to do

764
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,840
something else if i was going to save my

765
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,640
business

766
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,960
so yeah i went to a startup accelerator

767
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,240
now i had my

768
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,720
my uh product well it was open source at

769
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
that point smartphone pinterest

770
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,039
framework

771
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,520
and it was for mobile security testing

772
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,960
felt like that was a gap in the market

773
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,600
anyway

774
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,320
so i found a startup accelerator that

775
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,360
catered to

776
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,480
cyber security people who were

777
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
researchers helping them turn their

778
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,919
stuff into products

779
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,520
you know being an autistic person i'm

780
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,840
not sure to this day even though i still

781
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,559
do it that

782
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,480
startups are actually for me because

783
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,799
startups are a rollercoaster backwards

784
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,799
in the dark as i like to say

785
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,919
so you know it's really can be

786
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,000
incredibly stressful but also incredibly

787
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,120
rewarding so you know i like going to

788
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,480
college early i think

789
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
you know taking these big steps that may

790
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,880
seem a little dramatic

791
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
can really be a good thing you know

792
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,320
finding the place that you know works

793
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,080
for you at the time

794
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,720
so like going from eighth grade to

795
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
college early you know was finding the

796
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,919
right place for me

797
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,679
you know dropping out of the infosec

798
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,520
world and and moving on to more the

799
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
cyber security business world

800
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,520
at the time you know it did it was the

801
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,360
right place for me i've learned a ton

802
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,000
from the experience

803
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,120
so you know i did do my product it's a

804
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,799
called chavira i have a product called

805
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,880
dagger through it we do mobile security

806
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,080
testing products

807
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,360
you know if you guys are interested in

808
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
trying it out hit me up

809
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,520
twitter email all those places i'd love

810
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,200
to get you guys feedback

811
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,240
my original logo and my my new logo so

812
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
you know i learned a lot about business

813
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,919
you know i went from you know kind of

814
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,760
the girl with the the spikes and the

815
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,200
leather and stuff too you know the

816
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,039
button-down shirt and the normal looking

817
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,000
hair

818
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,039
and you know serious business person but

819
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,080
you know i found that there was a lot

820
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,600
stacked against me i mean certainly the

821
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
autism thing you know uh

822
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,440
about two percent of venture capital

823
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,360
funding goes to women founded companies

824
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,000
so

825
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,520
you know there's certainly sexism and

826
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,840
infosec but there's sexism outside of

827
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,720
infosec too

828
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
in the greater business world so i had

829
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,159
that and it's

830
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,080
it's definitely there are things that

831
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,400
are challenging in the startup world for

832
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,799
sure

833
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,039
but it's also been very rewarding and

834
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,159
has helped me with

835
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,159
you know my broader even technical

836
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,360
career so

837
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,919
you know taking an outside career path

838
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,120
you know if you're

839
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
very set on being you know you want to

840
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,880
be a hacker you know taking one of these

841
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,799
career paths like going into you know

842
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,640
venture capital or startups or something

843
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
like that you know it may be

844
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,600
you know the right pieces to ultimately

845
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,440
lead you in the direction you want to go

846
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,000
at least it was for me

847
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,360
so that takes us to about the time to

848
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,240
me too so me the metoo movement happened

849
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,159
and suddenly everything made a lot more

850
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,039
sense to me

851
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,799
you know i talked about a little bit

852
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,200
about how basically i had ptsd

853
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,080
after my experience in poland and i

854
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,159
didn't feel like i should because

855
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,640
i didn't feel like compared to survivors

856
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,279
of

857
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,640
things that were way worse than what

858
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,919
happened to me i didn't feel like i had

859
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,760
the right to have ptisd

860
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,240
and i didn't understand why like things

861
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,000
were so difficult i didn't understand

862
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,520
why people were being so mean to me and

863
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,200
saying they didn't believe me

864
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,080
and the metoo movement so many people

865
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,960
had

866
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,440
like the same story and i suddenly

867
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
realized that wow it was okay

868
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,480
to be imperfect it was okay to be

869
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,880
unfinished it was okay to make mistakes

870
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,120
and that i needed to forgive myself and

871
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,200
honestly the people who were so awful to

872
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,600
me

873
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
you know needed to you know look at

874
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
themselves that it wasn't all on me

875
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,240
sure i made mistakes but you know i

876
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,159
didn't have to be perfect

877
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,200
it was really not as bad as

878
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,360
it became and you know that gave me a

879
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,559
lot of validation

880
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,720
honestly that you know what i went

881
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,600
through was

882
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,399
an okay way to experience life even you

883
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,080
know even though i'm autistic it didn't

884
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,880
make me non-human

885
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,919
and then years and years later

886
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,640
i got this call and it was from a

887
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,320
reporter you know i get recalled from

888
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,080
reporters a lot i love doing press

889
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,919
but this particular one he sent me these

890
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,159
screenshots from facebook

891
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,840
and you know all these years later and

892
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,919
i'm like god aren't we past this yet

893
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,679
people are still writing this nonsense

894
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,960
about me on the internet

895
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,480
about derby con in 2013 and this is like

896
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,520
i don't know it was like last year

897
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,120
and there are some bad actors in the

898
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,360
community definitely you know there's

899
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,679
the sexism there's the racism

900
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,679
there's a lot of elitism like if you

901
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,080
don't have 30 years of experience

902
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,559
in and you're 20 years old then you're

903
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,080
not cool enough to be here

904
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,720
and you're gonna get the naysayers and

905
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,399
everybody says you know haters gonna

906
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:30,960
hate

907
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,679
shake it off i love taylor swift but i

908
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,720
mean that's just not

909
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,200
how the human mind works i mean people

910
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,159
are gonna say

911
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,480
your stuff is awesome like 99 of the

912
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,240
time and your brain is going to fixate

913
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,200
on the bad stuff so i think that you

914
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,960
should recognize that and don't beat

915
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,440
yourself

916
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,760
up for fixating on it but what works for

917
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
me is to take stuff like this put it in

918
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,279
my little folder of hate

919
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,919
and when i need you know a drive to stay

920
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,760
up longer work harder

921
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,240
you know get it done i remember stuff

922
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,960
like this

923
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,559
and i'm going to show them i'm going to

924
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,720
get the last laugh and i encourage you

925
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,039
to

926
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,799
as well because something's wrong with

927
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,760
them not you

928
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,480
speaking of media i've had some great

929
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,039
media experiences this is one of them

930
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,840
i was on abc world news tonight and it

931
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,000
was me and tim cook talking about

932
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,399
the fbi versus the iphone story a couple

933
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,200
years ago

934
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,679
and the main thing i learned from that

935
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,840
was how many people still watch the news

936
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,520
how many people who bullied me in middle

937
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,039
school were writing me on facebook

938
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,799
saying i saw you on the news

939
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,200
so that was pretty cool it was also in

940
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,240
this documentary

941
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,720
on pbs called life hackers and these

942
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,399
three students they're all women and

943
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,200
minorities

944
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,120
they basically took this big green bus

945
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,640
around the country you know you can look

946
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,320
it up and watch it it's a really fun

947
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,120
movie

948
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,640
and you know i told them stuff about

949
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,039
i guess the miniaturized version of this

950
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,320
talk and

951
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,679
they went and saw a lot of different

952
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,600
people and got career advice

953
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,360
and the best part about it though was

954
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
that like the next year

955
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,000
one of those students was a goon at

956
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
defcon and came to my book signing you

957
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
know in the shirt and i'm like

958
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,559
wow so it's definitely possible from all

959
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:10,960
like

960
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
walks of life including being on a green

961
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,080
bus to make it in security

962
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,679
but yeah go check out the documentary

963
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,360
it's really cool

964
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,279
and another thing tribe of hackers you

965
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,480
know if this talk isn't really

966
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,080
resonating to you if this is

967
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,480
way out of left field for your personal

968
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,440
experiences

969
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,360
i would really encourage you to check

970
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,120
out it's now a book series

971
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
tribe of hackers there's i think four of

972
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,799
them marcus carey

973
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,880
the main editor you know he is he's

974
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,200
black and from texas and grew up poor

975

because there's a lot of us out there

1006
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,720
and somebody's career path will be like

1007
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,600
yours i'm sure

1008
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,760
i said this was about a horse right so

1009
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,600
in the end it is

1010
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,120
so one of my biggest problems

1011
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,799
is that i could be very single-minded

1012
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,919
and i can work myself so hard i burn out

1013
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,360
just to the point where i'm like

1014
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,120
non-functional it's kind of what was

1015
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,159
going on during

1016
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,799
you know the time after poland as well i

1017
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,799
was just so burnt out on the whole thing

1018
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,360
i was

1019
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,480
hardly able to get my work done and when

1020
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,919
i went to mach 37

1021
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,600
actually one of the first things that

1022
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,760
people at max 37 said was you need a

1023
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,320
hobby

1024
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,000
because i didn't do anything besides

1025
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,399
work which made when the community

1026
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,080
turned on me in my career was

1027
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,760
as far as i could tell basically in the

1028
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,200
toilet uh

1029
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,039
it made it just that much worse that

1030
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,960
this was my whole life that had just

1031
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,679
blown up

1032
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,600
so i was like well i rode horses when i

1033
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,440
was a kid i'll ride horses again what's

1034
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,640
the worst that can happen

1035
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,279
well you know horses are expensive and

1036
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,679
startups don't pay very well so

1037
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,039
i guess the worst that could happen is i

1038
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,279
spend all my money on a horse and this

1039
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,000
is tempo

1040
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,360
he's the first horse i got and

1041
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,640
you know everything that i miss from

1042
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,799
my lack of understanding of people tempo

1043
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,279
makes up for it a thousand times and

1044
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,360
and when i feel like giving up and i

1045
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,960
feel like it's just not worth it and i

1046
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
just want to run away and go live in a

1047
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,440
hole

1048
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,559
like tempo reminds me

1049
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,519
why i need to carry on like if it's not

1050
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,360
enough to do it for yourself

1051
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,519
find someone or something to make it

1052
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,320
worth it tempo makes it all worth it

1053
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,919
i love him and then there was my i guess

1054
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,760
sally field moment so i said

1055
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
i left security about the time the book

1056
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,440
was coming out pretty much so

1057
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,519
you know the book doing well was kind of

1058
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,360
like something i saw in royalty

1059
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,600
statements because i kept getting checks

1060
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,960
and it kept coming out in different

1061
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
countries so it was kind of

1062
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,480
in my mind that okay i guess it didn't

1063
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,559
go as badly as i suspected

1064
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,919
but a couple years ago i did a keynote

1065
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,480
at carbon black one of the things that

1066
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,200
mach 37 did for me is it opened going

1067
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
from just the hacker conferences that

1068
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,240
i've been able to speak at things like

1069
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
rsa and this was

1070
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,200
you know carbon black's conference so

1071
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,039
things that are more business oriented

1072
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,519
so

1073
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,120
instead of just preaching to the choir

1074
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,799
of other hackers it's been able to get

1075
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,559
me out to a wider audience

1076
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,159
so it was the keynote at their

1077
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,480
conference and then they had me at black

1078
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,200
hat they

1079
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
bought 300 books and they were going to

1080
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,559
give them away and i was going to sign

1081
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,320
them and i was so afraid nobody was

1082
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,120
going to come

1083
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,919
at all i was so worried about it and

1084
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,039
then

1085
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,599
it looped around this gigantic booth

1086
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,079
multiple times in an hour we gave away

1087
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,599
all of them and there were still people

1088
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,119
in the line so it was my

1089
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,280
oh you do like me you really like me

1090
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,960
those jerks on ill mob

1091
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,918
don't like me but you know the bad

1092
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,440
apples of the elitists

1093
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,560
the biggest the misogynist the racist

1094
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,239
they're not the people that matter the

1095
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,639
people that matter are those people that

1096
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,879
you know stood in line to get this book

1097
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,199
the all the people that want to make it

1098
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,079
insecurity

1099
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,879
like making them happy is what really

1100
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,918
matters and

1101
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,079
they liked me that day and i was so

1102
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,839
happy and i felt like everything had

1103
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,079
gone full circle i was finally

1104
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,639
had the success that i wanted or maybe i

1105
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,159
had it the whole time and just didn't

1106
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,879
notice

1107
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,480
but it took running away and doing

1108
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,320
something completely different to get to

1109
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,480
that point

1110
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,880
and you know i said that startups may or

1111
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,920
may not be for me

1112
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,760
but one thing good thing that i have

1113
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,960
gotten out of startups

1114
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,280
is that i've been able to mentor other

1115
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,520
startups you know other people that are

1116
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,280
you know want to do startups you know

1117
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
kind of have experience in that space as

1118
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,079
well as in

1119
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,960
you know the hacking space and that

1120
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,160
generally leads to

1121
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,400
small stock options and occasionally

1122
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
when those startups do well

1123
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,880
you know that that leads to rewards and

1124
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,800
just recently that happened and i was

1125
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,040
able to get another horse this is denver

1126
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,640
that's not me riding him

1127
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,960
that's his old owner i don't ride nearly

1128
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,839
that pretty

1129
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,520
but he's awesome and so yeah

1130
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
everything works out well in the end so

1131
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,440
i get like this really awesome horse and

1132
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,880
i still have tempo and

1133
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,480
everything's going really well and now i

1134
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,400
get to keynote for you guys and

1135
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
hopefully i haven't run over

1136
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,520
too terribly awfully bad and hopefully

1137
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,640
you guys have gotten

1138
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
you know something out of this and you

1139
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,880
know really what i want to impart to you

1140
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,920
is that you know this is me in egypt i'm

1141
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,480
now a six

1142
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,800
continent speaker i've wanted to go to

1143
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,640
egypt my whole life and i finally got to

1144
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,160
do it last year

1145
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,839
and that's where i got my sixth

1146
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,599
continent you know speaker

1147
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,920
trainer author startup entrepreneur you

1148
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,240
know

1149
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,160
media talking head you know all these

1150
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,440
things that i do

1151
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,720
you know i've rather led a an odd path

1152
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,920
to get where i am

1153
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
but i think the biggest thing is that a

1154
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,000
lot of things that seem like the worst

1155
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,800
things ever

1156
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,280
like the community turning on me like

1157
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,119
led me to where i needed to go

1158
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,599
to get to the next part of my career i

1159
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,040
know i don't think i would have gotten

1160
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,640
to where i am today and had the

1161
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,800
opportunities that i had if that hadn't

1162
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,359
happened

1163
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,640
as bad as it was and so

1164
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,960
i guess no matter how bleak it looks

1165
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,680
it's

1166
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,079
likely gonna get way better if you

1167
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:46,880
persevere

1168
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,599
and carry on and i know that's hard i

1169
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,280
certainly struggle with it at times

1170
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,920
myself

1171
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,680
this like it would be so much easier to

1172
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,440
just give up but

1173
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,280
you know i encourage you again to put

1174
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,480
yourself out there

1175
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,280
be naive be arrogant apply for things

1176
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,760
that

1177
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,359
you don't think you have a chance of

1178
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,520
getting do it anyway

1179
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,240
don't say no for other people and you

1180
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,320
know the sky is the limit i think

1181
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,520
you know we have a really interesting

1182
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,839
job as security people we need to stop

1183
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,040
fighting with each other

1184
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,800
and start actually fighting the good

1185
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
fight because the state of security

1186
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,560
right now is really terrible

1187
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,960
and while it's a really hard problem to

1188
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,839
solve

1189
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,920
i think we can do better and i think a

1190
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,040
lot of you that are

1191
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,560
you know wondering if you're gonna be

1192
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,320
able to make a career in security you

1193
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
know if you are able to

1194
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,599
if you do persevere and get there i

1195
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,160
think some of you will be the ones that

1196
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,240
make the great strides towards you know

1197
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,400
making the world a place where people

1198
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,760
can actually live

1199
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,920
securely on the internet which would be

1200
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,960
really great

1201
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,359

1207
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,440
is when the second edition is coming out

1208
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,240
because

1209
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,040
like the horizon it is an imaginary line

1210
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,000
that recedes as you

1211
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,400

1212
