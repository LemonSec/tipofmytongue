00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,080
hello hackers

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,800
are you ready for a day of creativity

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,120
inspiration and knowledge sharing

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,400
welcome to our first ever activity con

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,880
we're here to hack for good default to

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,760
disclosure

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
and empower the community

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,599
hacking is the art of creatively

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,400
overcoming limitations

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,359
today is about celebrating the hacker we

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,960
all have within us

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,360
exploring and developing those amazing

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,440
hacking skills

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,920
when we acknowledge the hacker within we

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,640
can improve

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,320
anything

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,239
i can't give an opening address without

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,520
commenting on the world

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,559
we live in today nationalism is on the

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,280
rise

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
and many groups of people are looking

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,280
inwards instead of outwards

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,120
helping themselves instead of helping

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,000
others we're also fighting a pandemic

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and a huge economic crisis that comes

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,280
with it

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
so the world is in crisis this year of

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
2020

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
and it is more important than ever

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,439
before for us to come together globally

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,280
to solve problems hacking

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,400
is a global remote job

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,040
you're from countries all over the world

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,880
fighting for a common goal

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
together sharing collaborating

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,600
competing enjoying the collaboration

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,960
with each other

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
and it's exactly because of the

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,880
diversity of the hacking community

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
of the diversity of everyone's

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,400
background and opinion

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,759
and skills that organizations are

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
safer today that is how you create

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
hacker power security

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,040
that is also why it's so important to

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
have events like activitycon

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
where we bring everybody together to

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
inspire and to learn from each other

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
at hacker one default to disclosure is

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,560
one of our values

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,600
we try to be open and transparent by

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
sharing where we are vulnerable

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,479
companies can learn hackers can learn

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,080
and we are all safer in the end

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,640
we call our public vulnerability feed

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,000
activity

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
and we've seen thousands of

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
vulnerabilities publicly disclosed

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,640
for everyone to learn from some of these

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,599
vulnerabilities

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,120
you'll hear about today in the future we

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,520
hope

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,080
all organizations every company will

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
embrace transparency and openness

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,280
it is the only way to increase security

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
together we hit harder

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,640
as you can see from the agenda we have

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
today hacker park security is here to

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,760
stay

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
there is not one leading organization in

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
the world today that doesn't acknowledge

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
the enormous benefits

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,239
ethical hacking can bring our program

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,160
today will dive into those benefits

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,280
thinking back at history seven years ago

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,159
in our first

78
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,280
month of paying bounties we paid thirty

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,040
000 dollars to hackers who were

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,760
delighted for the rewards they received

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,239
that was seven years ago in the early

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,480
days of hacker bar security

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
in april of this year of 2020

84
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,720
you earned a whopping 5.9 million

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
dollars in bounties

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
a fantastic accomplishment by all of you

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,480
and this year the hacking community and

88
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,519
us together

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
achieved over 100 million in all-time

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599
bounties paid

91
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,799
100 million dollars so far

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
but there's another 100 million number

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,760
at play here

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,200
there's about 100 million

95
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,959
vulnerabilities out there in the wild

96
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,120
in production software in products and

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
websites and systems

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,519
that are still out there not found not

99
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,040
fixed yet

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
these are the holes criminals will use

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,720
to break in

102
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
as they look to steal data install

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,400
malware

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
disrupt vital operations distort facts

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
or threaten democracies it will take

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,439
years to find all those bugs

107
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,799
but it will happen and you will play a

108
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,640
major role in making our world more

109
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
secure

110
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,839
in fact i believe you will earn

111
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,560
one billion dollars in bug bounties

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
within five years

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,520
doing this wonderful job of yours

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,160
and within 15 years this hacking

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,320
community will have produced

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,560
over 500 csos chief information security

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,440

119
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,840
hacking in the hiking community

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,919
as we've said you know the only way to

121
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,680
do security is in open

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,560
and together by defaulting to disclosure

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,479
and empowering each other
