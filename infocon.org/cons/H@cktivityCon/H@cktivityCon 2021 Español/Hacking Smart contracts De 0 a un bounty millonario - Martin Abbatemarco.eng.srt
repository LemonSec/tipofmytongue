1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,910
good to all, how are you doing? I

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,620
can't say martín pincho that as everyone

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,379
wants for those who are not from argentina it

4
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:15,910
is very common to close them martínez

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,320
pincho

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,930
you are written researcher in an

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,539
action open zeppelin company and we are going to talk a

8
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,460
little about 20 world we are dedicated  I don't know if

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,750
this hacking smartphone

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,060
tracks and trivializing it is this hakim of

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,740
dreaming with tracks of 0 with vaughn

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,439
resigned, the idea then for today

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,270
is to

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,219
tell you a little about what

15
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:37,809
this whole new world of

16
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:39,880
hacking smart with tracks is about  The reality is that it

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,570
is something quite new in science

18
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,820
a couple of years ago that well I dedicate myself to

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,620
this the reality that is growing more

20
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,630
and more is gaining more and more

21
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,640
popularity so it is great that

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,840
we have this space to talk a

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,960
little I can not send you  one to do

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,210
what re technical explanations of how to

25
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,829
do smart hacking with tracks just

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,239
because I understand that there are a lot of the

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,729
other side seeing us that maybe they are not

28
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,290
so  familiar with many concepts

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,720
of this and even that it is a start

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,759
with tracks and if it eats if it breaks what

31
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,729
is this so nothing made it a

32
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,159
good guy let's start talking about this

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,710
small world that deteriorated what it

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,040
is and what it is like  This environment, the execution

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,130
of these decentralized applications,

36
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,390
then we are going to go a bit like a smartphone track looks like,

37
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,950
then we are going

38
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,690
to see some attacks, some

39
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,759
basic vulnerabilities and from

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,580
there on, I will tell you at least three

41
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,020
cases of vulnerability, it is quite

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,110
piolas that ended  being

43
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,640
that they ended up winning they still say that

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,440
a system in the world of vacancies

45
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,539
is growing more and more but it is very

46
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,280
very recent all this in the world of

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,100
therion think that I already began to be more

48
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,929
or less three years to do

49
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,479
security research on  this and there were no

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,700
gloves at the time and I think they just

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,710
exploded or are starting to

52
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,260
squeeze this year and a little bit last year

53
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,270
and it's very  interesting because well let's

54
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,850
see that there is a very interesting amount of money

55
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,260
for those who are in

56
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,699
the wagon and just for

57
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,360
economic reasons I also think

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,670
there is a lot to do on that side

59
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,840
then well this little

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,100
outside world that talks about defy or fío de

61
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,260
decentralized finance if you talk about

62
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,250
nextive - cannes fans and you talk about

63
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,470
hundreds of autonomous organizations that

64
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,540
are the dice and there are many other things

65
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,360
happening in this small sphere

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,360
within the something bigger is called the web 3

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,980
some will have already heard of

68
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,480
this type of new applications that are

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,180
emerging that many are built

70
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,640
on the ternium network not in particular

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,350
I think that ifai is something that is

72
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,780
happening today that many are already

73
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,520
knowing and are having access there they

74
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,260
are somehow looking for

75
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,760
hatred many now  i need to talk about

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,870
'stable' coins from die from west sct and

77
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,760
well on cis is also exploding

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,410
now a lot of people collect hashish d  e

79
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,560
all kinds and there are even some

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,820
researchers as well as security and

81
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,320
developers who are participating in

82
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,440
this,

83
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,120
these are things that are happening at

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,680
this rate, not at the end and in the end we are not

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,120
so interested in that we are a little interested in

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,730
understanding that it is ethereal then very

87
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,590
large  traits we would be saying that a

88
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,000


89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,450
decentralized network computing platform

90
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,349
where what we would only be interested in

91
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:26,150
is that it will be with an

92
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,069
execution environment that now we are going to talk a

93
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,750
little about that execution environment of

94
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,849
how these applications are executed and

95
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,159
there is a base  of data if then this

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,900
execution environment is the previous

97
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,370
virtual machine and that data base that I

98
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,560
commented to you maintains the state of this

99
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,840
world machine that is running

100
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,420
all day

101
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,799
and this state is saved in what is

102
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,540
called a bloc but we are a database of

103
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,280
data quite inefficient but in

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,040
a very safe way so I think that is

105
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,480
a bit what interests us so far to

106
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,489
understand the application criteria  s that

107
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,379
run on this network in it is also of

108
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,760
execution that it monaterio a virtual

109
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,290
machine a virtual machine that has a

110
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,419
being of instructions that keeps state

111
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,120
law and saves state in a thing

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,349
called blog has a very particular database

113
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,060


114
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,940
if we want to see  a new deterioration 1

115
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,180
these nodes that make up the network many

116
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,730
look a little so we do not have on the one hand

117
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,459
a component that is the fm that is this

118
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,290
thing that executes the programs of this

119
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,669
virtual machine that has a set of

120
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,260
instructions that executes these

121
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,700
programs and  The idea should be to talk about

122
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,370
these programs and then there are accounts

123
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,410
saved in the state where some part

124
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,150
of those accounts are component accounts

125
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,800
is the code that these accounts can

126
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,240
have, they can also have other things

127
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,710
the accounts because having a balance in

128
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,410
ether can have other things than

129
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,970
We are not going to go into detail I want us to

130
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,650
understand that there are accounts stored in

131
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,710
this database that have codes and

132
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,360
there is an FM that is in charge  to run

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,850
those programs and these programs are

134
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,500
the ones that we are talking about smart with

135
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,300
tracks round smart contracts is

136
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,910
a very bad name

137
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,090
quite marketer and I think it would have

138
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,470
been much better for the entire industry

139
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,270
if the so-called type exists in another way

140
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,520
I do not know how these prices or some  thing

141
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,470
like that but

142
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,000
tell people who think they do

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,830
fantastic things are smart with tracks

144
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,160
and are not so smart at the end

145
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,540
but hey this is the name we have

146
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,920
today is mark on drugs and

147
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,280
smart contracts that are

148
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,110
are a piece of code we are going to

149
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,340
to recap a bit is a piece of

150
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,560
code then that runs in the

151
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,870
virtual machine called dbm this

152
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,820
virtual machine runs you are running in

153
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,650
nodes of a decentralized network that is to

154
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,710
say that there is no central point and already as

155
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,180
an authority within being of a

156
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,850
horizontal network  of these smart nodes with

157
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,050
tracks and the ability to read and

158
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,210
write data in a public block,

159
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,460
it is the option that is up for grabs.  down

160
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,220
from ternium they handle a lot of silver

161
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,070
natively and

162
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,060
absurd amounts of silver if you

163
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,280
ask me and they are written in a

164
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,590
language called solid, that is, if you

165
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,690
request it, it is a high-level language you usually

166
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,910
say with batteries they demanded byte saudis

167
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,980
ebay tous explosion  in these accounts

168
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,419
of experts and there are other

169
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:03,130
smart programming languages with tracks but I think

170
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,169
that 90% are activating percent of

171
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,430
being programmed today they have requested

172
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,680
so here we have several

173
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,510
interesting characteristics but I say

174
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,580
there are three that are very interesting and there are

175
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,530
pieces of code  that are public that they

176
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,550
are a double public action

177
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,050
either because the one of which to

178
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,280
create anyone can call them with

179
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,320
any type of parameters

180
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,610
an absurd amount of plants is handled so

181
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,800
I say if there are interesting things that

182
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,690
surely can happen not like any piece

183
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,430
of code if one  it breaks, it is safe, it

184
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,949
has vulnerabilities and it is certain that something can be

185
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,330
done with this if we add

186
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,120
a cap to that  to that anyone can or

187
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,410
anyone can call it anyone

188
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,460
can execute its functions with

189
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,710
any type of parameter to that we

190
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,900
execute another layer of they handle an

191
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,280
absurd amount of silver

192
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,350
natively and if they want we can follow type

193
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,720
these contracts are immutable that is  What

194
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,580
is code that is beach and good that it

195
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,470
depreciates you cannot touch sauces and a

196
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,419
bar you have to do like a trick

197
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,639
to be able to solve that bar then

198
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,830
we already have a certain set of characteristics with a certain environment

199
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,690


200
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,389
that makes this

201
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,620
quite sensitive  and it begins to explain

202
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,990
a little why there are so many hacks that

203
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,760
are happening in millions of dollars

204
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,700
every day in matter

205
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,590
and that is why these antista bagua programs begin to appear

206
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,020


207
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,120
that are offering so much money and we are going

208
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,550
to talk a little about that  Later on

209
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,170
then if you want to understand soliti and not

210
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,120
move from the detail how a contract is operated

211
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,530
but understand that if we want to

212
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,510
make security  about smart contract what

213
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,010
we are talking about is basically like

214
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,780
a why box week where we are going to have

215
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,130
to go to read codes and we are going to read

216
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,780
marc codes with tracks these

217
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,550
explanations are made in

218
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,840
solid hamas language and a

219
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,070
high level language that they have there  on the

220
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,140
screen that is very similar type is not

221
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,110
an object-oriented language type I

222
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,140
do not know with java or something like that

223
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,820
the syntax such is a little similar and

224
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,500
so far nothing more but for it to be an

225
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,940
idea you cannot start a contract with

226
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,280
a class  in the state variables the

227
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,200
contracts as attributes,

228
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,090
the contracts as a method already work, it is not an

229
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,160
action thing for the same medium, quite

230
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,930
light,

231
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,700
if we want to go to a little more

232
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,560
advanced things with the contracts, we are going to see

233
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,000
things like this, we are going to see what they finally have,

234
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,010
for example  balances I do not raise

235
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,240
state

236
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,340
we can have constructors that are thrown as

237
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,930
many as the song, for example, of tokens

238
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,090
that have that contract

239
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,220
saved and we have functions  ones that there is

240
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,539
for example a public function that says

241
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,919
transfer where what it is going to do is how to

242
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,539
make a balance shop, no,

243
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:21,770
obviously, others and detail how it

244
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,789
works but it is so that they become

245
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:25,099
familiar with the syntax of the

246
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:26,780
thing that we are going to see how  it is broken

247
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,840
later then a very very

248
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,958
very simple contract you can see something like this for

249
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,610
those who are more familiar this is

250
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,169
like a very simplified version of a

251
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,029
standard called reserve and

252
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,799
once you heard about die die it is

253
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,320
a contract that  It is a token that follows

254
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,120
a standard, a specification, that is,

255
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,709
a set of functions that it has to

256
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:48,649
implement in its public interface and

257
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,209
this, as the very simplified version of

258
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,380
that, there is a function that allows us, for

259
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,029
example, to transfer caps, not knowing a

260
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,070
balance swap between accounts.  In this

261
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,140
case and there is an

262
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,209
interesting syntax that has a request

263
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:02,639
a step further and talking about how

264
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,920
we are completing the question a little more

265
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,720


266
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,670
here  It has a snippets and I was

267
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,170
cutting it, it has some little things that I took out

268
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,209
but that you understand how the code looks,

269
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,100
request a little more complex and already a

270
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,249
little understanding what this is about, what

271
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:18,899
you see here is code that I took from

272
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,610
verified code an explorer of the

273
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,959
therion's relationship anyone can

274
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,329
come in and see the chickens then there

275
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,309
you can go has an explorer

276
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:28,499
caller straight cam and you go in there and you see

277
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:30,779
the contracts the public code of that

278
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,459
contract and you can grab it from loja

279
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,869
absolutely what there are men to go out

280
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,160
to find  vulnerabilities there

281
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,439
then if you go to the old code and you are going

282
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:38,689
to find

283
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:41,850
something like this you are going to find we are going

284
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,209
to increase the complexity

285
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,889
in the case of ai it is particular because of the

286
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,660
syntax it is a bit of faith the name of the

287
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,399
variables are not so friendly but

288
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,050
hey  They are realizing this type

289
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,209
of thing and fundamentally they want to

290
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,679
reload it now at this point from the

291
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,929
return one can go to the address is

292
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,459
where they are after  Legacies say how the

293
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,899
address where this service is deployed

294
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,670
that exist for contract can

295
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,189
be downloaded the code is public it is

296
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:06,470
there it is in the pad 112 bp in the blogs

297
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,139
in the choice of term of -9 a

298
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,670
public network and well you download your

299
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,709
machine can you say it read line by

300
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,449
line exactly how it works and the

301
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:15,709
mutability code is that it will work

302
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,129
like this then a little security on

303
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:20,629
smartphone traxis they will start to

304
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,100
make you go gloves on smart with tracks they

305
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,439
have to start dealing with this

306
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:26,059
type of  things have to be grabbing

307
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,309
code to download only to your computer and

308
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,470
having the ability to read codes to it,

309
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,600
tested such in others in other branches of

310
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,949
computer security, we may

311
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,259
find that it is not so necessary to

312
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,600
know the programming language

313
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,889
in the case if we are going to  do smartphone

314
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,010
drugs

315
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,720
you have to know a little programming

316
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,980
because they are going to find these

317
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,650
things a lot

318
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,970
and they go a step further when we

319
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,890
have to do street assessments  from smart

320
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,570
condrac are to find with lists

321
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,040
of solliden files we are not talking

322
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,110
about a file a contract we are

323
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,210
talking about multiple contracts that

324
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,980
communicate with each other that talk with each other

325
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,730
what is that system is composed of I am

326
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,470
broken down with above 20 30 40

327
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,000
different contracts that are being

328
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,650
communicating with each other both pse and that

329
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,840
the complexity grows the thing and if

330
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,220
you get to do something when

331
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,980
there is a drop in the audience in a

332
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,170
therion project

333
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,310
probably a repo enters and javi they

334
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,290
find lists of soliti files of

335
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,940
this style the question is how

336
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,460
We face this not as how we face

337
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,840
this complexity to start

338
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
finding vulnerabilities

339
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,420
but before we get into that we see what it

340
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,580
means to attack a contract because

341
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,110
we are talking about the code then it

342
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,330
seems that it does not have too many 10 good

343
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,700
as an attacker could think this

344
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,800
when we execute it transa that is  an

345
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,080
interesting concept that we have to

346
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,640
think about when we talk about therion and the

347
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,900
lesson we have in transactions

348
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,490
we can think at the discretion of a

349
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,070
state machine and where what we

350
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,480
have to do as an attacker what

351
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,800
he has to do is take a

352
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,050
contract from a state to a state is that

353
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,520
he does it through transactions and

354
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,590
execute  transactions in the network so

355
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,270
that the contract changes state in

356
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,770
some way that after the killing of action

357
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,450
and a state is reached that is convenient for

358
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,910
the attacker, sometimes the attacks

359
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,890
are not in one or a single transaction but

360
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,210
rather in several  So as

361
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,280
attackers you don't have to

362
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,110
find me a flow of transactions

363
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,340
that reaches the desired state

364
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,240
and if we think about it from another perspective

365
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,459
I can think that what an attacker is

366
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,319
doing is also communicating with a

367
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,329
node, not us to connect

368
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,709
with it.  recreators at the end of the day

369
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,209
we have to send these transactions to

370
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,100
12 there are new audiences you yourself

371
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,569
can set up your own node on your

372
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:35,720
local machines a w100 what  They want to

373
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,699
raise a node or talk to

374
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,100
public nodes too, so if they have to

375
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,620
do a profuse 11 for something like that, it often gave the

376
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,809
idea to have communication

377
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:46,819
with a node, it

378
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:49,259
says something like that, not us as from the

379
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:51,389
outside with our scripts that we are going to

380
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:53,100
see something  From that we find a

381
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,199
vulnerability and well from there

382
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,699
we have to communicate with a

383
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:58,410
local oasis to have a local testing environment

384
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,509
and be able to send transactions and demonstrate

385
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:02,610
an attack if we have to make a

386
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,819
report at the forefront almost

387
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:07,620
as it looks like this sometimes we also

388
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,529
leave  From a more general perspective,

389
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,819
what we find

390
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,589
is a contract that has a flaw, yes

391
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:15,720
then when we have found a

392
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,420
flaw because we send a

393
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,129
transaction sometimes with a single transaction for a

394
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:21,779
ready enough to be able to demonstrate a

395
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,019
vulnerability sometimes it does not reach and it

396
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,930
What we have to do is talk to

397
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,950
other contracts as I told

398
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,600
them today the applications with three

399
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,610
envelopes we must  be for multiple

400
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,930
contracts so we have to send

401
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,280
one, for example a transaction to a

402
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,620
contract and the vulnerability

403
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,420
is actually in a contract that is in the

404
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,040
back that we do not have access to so

405
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,620
out there we have to enter it and on the other

406
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,280
hand somehow and it  I would see how today

407
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,950
roughly this way and not only that sometimes

408
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,980
we have that there are certain attacks that are

409
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,290
carried out through our contracts,

410
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,170
we as

411
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,890
security researchers also

412
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,440
have the ability to obviously

413
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,700
develop contracts and there are certain

414
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,980
attacks due to their complexity or presumption

415
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,290
of  execution that require yes or yes that we

416
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,850
integrate that logic in a contract that

417
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,490
we see a contract and that through a

418
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,500
contract as it is the hacking of other

419
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,610
contracts that becomes quite

420
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,760
interesting in that sense and that is

421
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,430
quite like that much unless the

422
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,620
hack  be very simple in general very much

423
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,750
logic of the looting in the end it will be given

424
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,580
in an attacking contract that ends with

425
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,660
interacting  With vulnerable contracts,

426
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,920
both with a

427
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,600
vulnerable contract directly and with some

428
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,080
that are behind,

429
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,480
as you see an attack, a bit in attack,

430
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,899
it looks like this and it is strange, I know, I do not want them to

431
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:43,100
understand every line because what is

432
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,209
happening here but what you want

433
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,069
show with this is all these

434
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:47,360
transactions abroad are

435
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,579
public that means that when

436
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,889
a meynet exploit occurs and 10

437
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,230
million dollars are stolen we can go and we can

438
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,880
see all the transactions and I am a

439
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,290
transaction explorer that I am

440
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,329
showing you with screenshot where  line by

441
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,220
line we can see everything as the xx

442
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,170
are trades of the transaction and we can

443
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,949
see exactly everything that happened

444
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:08,389
that is public and

445
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,889
only can anyone from

446
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,540
beginners to very advanced and

447
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,040
we can learn a lot like that because it is

448
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,300
like that  Everything is transparent and we can

449
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,310
see exactly how the experts are,

450
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,870
which seems to me something very interesting that

451
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,209
perhaps in another  The world of

452
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:22,459
computer security is not seen so much here at the end of

453
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:23,360
the day we are giving you with a

454
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,620
transaction that never happens has

455
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,670
happened to you, it is stealing

456
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,540
relatively little money for the world

457
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,170
that planetary soil being 24 k of 24

458
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,880
k dollars than for the whole world  it is

459
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,250
very little but good it is to be an

460
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,330
idea and as it is a transaction

461
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,610
what type of attacks are there to give there are a

462
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,529
lot of types of attacks and here

463
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,570
against there is a graph that I do not

464
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,370
agree so much with this graph if we are going

465
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,230
to  the details but I think that to

466
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,060
begin to understand a little it makes sense

467
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,830
and we are going to get more into some

468
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,290
examples more people but I want us to

469
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,480
understand that there are several layers

470
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,460
when we talk about security in

471
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,130
foreign contracts

472
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,780
and that way when we make securities even

473
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,010
with  tracks we are not only focusing

474
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,990
on higher layers not we

475
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,400
are not talking about vulnerabilities in

476
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,560
diego nodes in the infrastructure we

477
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,970
are not talking about attacks as

478
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,800
economic  s about the therion network we

479
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,020
are not talking about doing a social

480
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,900
engineering and giving someone an office

481
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,610
to send us ether to our account

482
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,960
we are talking about vulnerabilities in

483
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,700
contracts they are like a little in the

484
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,050
layers above that are indicated

485
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,850
there and there are like  Certain vulnerabilities

486
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,820
that are agnostic to the protocol

487
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,410
means that they are not closely related to

488
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,420
business logic, so

489
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,770
you may find that you go to a

490
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,930
project, hold on, they start with

491
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,540
that and you may find that there

492
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,280
are vulnerabilities that can be

493
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,080
carried out.  any application many

494
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,000
times regardless of the

495
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,830
business logic of your application but there are many

496
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,210
vulnerabilities and above all the most

497
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,490
critical most interesting ones,

498
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,440
which are those that are closely

499
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,240
related to the upper layer ghana

500
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,890
and the one that says as protocol attacks or

501
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,649
mark tax that many  Sometimes they are closely

502
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:02,290
related to the execution environment of

503
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,839
those smart contract kisses and very

504
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,250
related  oned to business logic that

505
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,020
means that sometimes we have to

506
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,790
read a band of documentation a lot of

507
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,709
documentation on how that

508
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,410
protocol works to understand exactly how

509
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,510
it can be violated if it is not enough for us to

510
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,839
know a web an ander floan rien trans

511
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,490
and as basic things  of sea attacks with

512
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,859
tracks, but we have to understand very

513
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,929
in detail how it works, we are not

514
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:27,189
talking about what comes from the subject, there

515
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,110
are dissemination protocols, they are

516
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,850
decentralized finances and out there we have to

517
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,830
know how to understand how a

518
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,800
decentralized loan protocol works

519
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,630
or a protocol is Iberian hinson

520
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,660
protocol  the world or whatever, not

521
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,740
like there are different types of protocols

522
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,190
today and we have to have an idea of how that

523
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,390
is working

524
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,940
so where do I start to look and

525
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,820
we are going to see some very quick examples

526
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,470
if you want to start with very basic

527
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,700
things there are things published  there are things about

528
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,870
these attacks this is like this

529
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,400
vulnerability like - tics that

530
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,980
refer to  Well protocols can

531
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,170
find some resources and look for

532
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,670
some of these keywords in google

533
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,070
they will find them very quickly if they want to

534
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,600
later better at the end let's talk a

535
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,890
little about these 7 efe is some

536
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,300
externals that after violating or

537
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,000
violating the defile is that there is

538
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,710
good  How it looks like some war games

539
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,020
to start learning how

540
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,000
smac with tracks are hacked and to be able to carry a little

541
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,620
that is done always reserves how many

542
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,140
in this

543
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,730
industry where I keep looking once you eat

544
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,610
these basics and books can read a

545
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,170
little more to the  rays and that I am going to

546
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,960
share resources in this regard, there are

547
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,880
much more advanced things that we can

548
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,800
start to look at, so if they are going

549
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,120
to look at a contract, they probably

550
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,220
want to start with places where these

551
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,830
contracts handle deposits or withdrawals of

552
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,570
stock in itself of stubborn

553
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,860
fundamentally where it goes  money to enter or leave

554
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,450
a contract

555
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,620
external calls made by

556
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,450
contracts are usually vulnerable, they

557
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,279
are usually dangerous.  Igneous, not vulgar, not very

558
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,559
dangerous, they will find logic that is very

559
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,970
complicated to follow, they will find

560
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,519
things that programmers are

561
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,100
used to being assessment wave box.

562
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,809


563
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:07,820


564
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,460
It is

565
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,960
difficult to follow there are no

566
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,279
low-level assembly calls as

567
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,660
generally in these things

568
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,580


569
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,920
vulnerabilities can happen if we want to go one step

570
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,380
further we can still start

571
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,760
talking about interactions with

572
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,640
external dependencies like when obviously in

573
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,410
detail what these things are because

574
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,300
maybe  Many do not give us time to

575
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,430
explain everything, but hey when one

576
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,930
protocol interacts with another,

577
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,850
probably in that interaction those

578
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,190
interfaces may have

579
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,570
subtleties that the developers did not

580
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,060
take into account and can be exploited

581
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,830
today there is a lot of bridge what they

582
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,050
call bridges between different networks

583
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,300
between  therion and other networks and in those

584
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,590
bridges that is an infrastructure

585
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,360
quite new ture that basically no one

586
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,700
knows exactly how to do there is a lot of

587
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,290
improvisation and there have also

588
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,150
been enough with the realities

589
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,620
and then there are many dynamics that

590
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,059
appear in the con smart against which

591
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:03,020
is something that you are doing every

592
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,610
week always in a new protocol one

593
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,650
new way something different to do

594
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,140
to understand

595
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,360
last year fundamentally appeared

596
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,130
something that sanz flash lounge where one

597
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,650
can take a loan of money with

598
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,360
the attractions sea with drugs and

599
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,650
return it in the same transaction

600
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,360
then you can have in a transaction

601
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,000
for being like a billionaire always

602
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,410
and when that money returns it, it will be the

603
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,940
same transaction with a

604
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,460
very interesting and native mechanics to

605
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,049
how your andrax framework works and

606
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,299
other scenarios have appeared that some

607
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,860
are listed there as from running back

608
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,770
running, there are scenarios of

609
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,419
economic attacks that are interested, such as the

610
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,460
chaff neither of the business logic and

611
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,380
until  They put the economic design

612
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,590
incentives of a system also something

613
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,670
infinite to do in this case

614
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,470
the horns of some things so

615
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,650
that they are grabbing I know that it is a lot

616
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,420
of content and that I am pulling a

617
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,490
chair of information but good

618
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,170
for the one who goes  Interesting yes and

619
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,150
tomorrow the leader is put and you can

620
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,890
investigate certain terms

621
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,890
that are so rocks

622
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,620
so we are going to see three cases

623
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,790
of three different rounds

624
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,740
and we are going to start with some more basic

625
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,720
and then we are going to increase in

626
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,600
complexity and

627
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,660
these are three examples  something that is

628
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,660
their god is every week it is not

629
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,660
really every week as much as

630
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,809
black hats that are stuck in mainetti and

631
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:34,179
millions are stolen as well as white

632
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:37,210
hats that rescue things both doing

633
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,340
white hats outside the bagua before and

634
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,440
inside ba quantis

635
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,410
more and more city and

636
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,150
nothing I hope that with these examples a

637
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,250
little and

638
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,110
interest them more and more in the subject

639
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,570
we will see maybe some time we

640
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,490
will  We are going to this so advanced in these

641
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,150
examples the ones that I brought are

642
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,429
or not even these maybe we will see

643
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:03,730
some of the suits that are back

644
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,980
three of many that go up per week and

645
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,600
well the idea is to continue to interest them

646
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,210
and understand how these are given  types of

647
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,909
attacks on smart with tracks and

648
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,370
see how much smart people pay today

649
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,289
I go to them when without being with tracks

650
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:23,740
then we are going to start with the first one

651
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,740
that was a project that was in a

652
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,450
project that is called or was called I do not know

653
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,420
if existing  so ricky in the water and

654
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,580
basically and this is the most basic and it is

655
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,280
to be an idea of sometimes it is

656
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,260
with very simple things very simple errors

657
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,050
developers

658
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,210
one can find

659
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,679
tremendous vulnerabilities with a lot of funds they have

660
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,510
risk then sometime we are already

661
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,630
involved that is  it was punctured but this is

662
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,040
very simple it means if it is very simple

663
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,850
but on the other hand it gives me an idea of

664
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,280
what state the smart contract insecurity is

665
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,640
and well sometimes you have to overcome

666
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,170
all this knowledge barrier this

667
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:08,260
is curved learning that I was

668
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,830
telling you

669
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,080
in a very summarized way too quickly

670
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,840
probably

671
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,549
but sometimes once you get over that

672
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:18,919
little part you are going to find this

673
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,630
kind of thing then there was a contract

674
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,460
and we are not going to get involved.  detail of the

675
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,110
contract because the truth is not necessary

676
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,370
then one of these attacks that

677
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,559
told them a very agnostic type to what

678
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,539
happens in the contract that had this

679
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,990
function is a function that says init yes

680
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,179
that takes three parameters takes an address

681
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,779
and josh strings as parameters

682
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:40,370
and then he has disputed several more things

683
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,620
this is a is cut and with these

684
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,490
eight lines of sun and you

685
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,289
we are going to understand the vulnerability

686
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:49,730
that simple it

687
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,200
was a function and they saw that it says

688
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,920
external I

689
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,780
did not bring the rest of the body of the

690
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,080
function believe me it did not  missing

691
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,700
we see that it is an external function

692
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,110
means that a function that the contract

693
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,670
exposes means that it is a function

694
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,680
that anyone can input  call

695
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,160
with any parameter if it is as a

696
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,020
public point that whoever this contract and

697
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,580
anyone can call bias you can

698
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,460
build a compact javascript script

699
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,890
that connects with nodes and

700
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,950
calls this function yes and execute this

701
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,450
code that is inside this function

702
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,220
of this smart  contract you call the

703
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,810
and it function and you can pass any

704
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,490
parameter because this is exposed and you

705
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,180
can pass anything

706
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,060
trivial the almost because it is clear that there is

707
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,250
perhaps clearer for what it is

708
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,520
starting no but there is a flaw in the

709
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,080
access controls in a

710
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,940
Exposed function that is, it is like a

711
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,190
public heater that nobody protected with anything

712
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,320
good that is a bit the same the take

713
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,640
against what happens the same if we do not put

714
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,740
their Indians developers do not put

715
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,330
access controls in public functions

716
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,460


717
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,090
anyone can call them with

718
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,650
any parameter and  well from

719
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,360
there the logic depends on the function we see

720
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,610
what is going to happen in this particular case they are

721
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,140
going to see that this p  The first parameter

722
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,540
that says new join and then there is a

723
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,310
function one calls an internal function

724
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,590
that is transferred one receives and

725
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,600
this parameter appears is miner again, that is to

726
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,490
say that basically we are taking

727
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,560
as a source a parameter controlled by

728
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,090
an attacker and we are passing it a

729
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,010
function  directly without any type of

730
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,140
validation now because I started

731
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,700
transferring them and basically what we

732
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,230
are allowing is that sharing

733
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,360
wants to call this function and

734
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,080
anyone becomes the owner of the contract

735
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,180
in general the cons tells you that

736
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,100
contracts have owners because

737
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,310
access controls are implemented and  roles

738
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,810
in contracts and like many in

739
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,840
any other applications there are roles and

740
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,420
many times there is a single role that is the

741
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,190
owner of the contract, say an account with

742
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,570
privileges that can execute the

743
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,490
sensible actions if then in this

744
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,810
case anyone can call this

745
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,030
init function as initialist  again

746
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,220
the contract passes

747
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,409
once an uncontrolled by the

748
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:59,419
attacker  nte in this parameter nyoun er and it

749
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:01,159
automatically becomes the owner

750
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,710
of the contract

751
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,900
javier once this happens there was

752
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,120
additional logic in other functions that

753
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,530
is, they had access controls

754
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,750
but hey there had been a take over

755
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,360
of the contract and the owner could call

756
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,539
those other functions and play a little

757
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:19,700
with these 6.5 million dollars that

758
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,360
someone risk in this contract

759
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,250
was a single week function was a

760
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,960
transaction you will become the owner and you

761
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,110
could steal 625 million quite

762
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,390
complicated

763
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,190
this is found by

764
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,770
a security researcher through

765
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,289
a  anti lazy and he takes no less than

766
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:42,559
42 dollars

767
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,360
and it is published you can go to see the

768
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,419
published report and you can read more the

769
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,039
details of these but again it is something

770
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,730
very simple if you overcome this

771
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,799
learning barrier that the

772
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,360
smartphone tracks that are  understand well

773
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,100
this stereo execution environment in the

774
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,780
blog simple word I mentioned them at the

775
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,070
beginning the vulnerabilities the

776
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,830
attacks c  he way to interact and others can

777
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,090
be found with this type of thing

778
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,390
has been this for those of us who are

779
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,590
auditors or security researchers it

780
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,390
is more with tracks against a vague that

781
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,690
is how too obvious it is as for one

782
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,669
who makes

783
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:18,970


784
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,340
infrastructure bridges like crystals it is a lot

785
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,990
easier but he is in

786
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,580
this type of thing

787
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,480
and well he took a nice bounty I think

788
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,880
for something they even reactivated quite

789
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,649
simple but hey there were so many funds at

790
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:37,590
risk he gave them there were 6.5 million it makes

791
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,899
sense to take this and let's see

792
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:41,399
a little how  we know only a little

793
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:43,800
later about this kind of thing

794
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,810
we are going to talk about another

795
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,460
example now and it will be a little more

796
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,830
complicated if maybe there is a type of

797
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,980
interaction that I hope does not

798
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,600
scare you so much but hey let's talk

799
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,150
about nafti yes  ever heard of the

800
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,300
analysis of these as collectibles

801
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,530
that appear on the blog that have not

802
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,350
deteriorated and one can buy their fan

803
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,980
artist crypto punk yes and blah blah  This was

804
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,310
one that weeks with the idea of hi

805
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,710
macs was that there was a contract that this

806
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,810
contract and is chewed there so

807
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,030
a person could come

808
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,740
during an initial period

809
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,970
towards the min, that is, the issuance of the

810
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,430
masters where there was a period like

811
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,560
woods  trapping of the protocol where they

812
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,590
were going to emit up to 16 thousand 384 nastic

813
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,040
for some reason it was that number

814
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,110
the idea was a person came and could

815
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,630
say I want my interest to say emit

816
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,120
so many in ecstasy and I will pay you in

817
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,390
ether because if they pay ether so much for  To be able to

818
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,370
clean these anti if the contract has

819
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,950
the necessary logic to emit those

820
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,160
anesthes and

821
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,180
send them to you for

822
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,550
I am not going to put the size that are the

823
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,220
snow funk soul actresses play, you can

824
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,530
publish a little more what it is about

825
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,930
is crazy re interesting to start

826
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,540
investigate about this and it was getting

827
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,090
quite popular and

828
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,960
then we are going to a little bit of the

829
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,970
function of this contract and there we are going to

830
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,530
give a little more sun and we are going to

831
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,450
understand you a little more appears is  ta

832
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,630
function that says min in this it is

833
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,490
called if they lie about this and we pass it as a

834
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,320
parameter the number of netflix that

835
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,460
we wanted to mediate, true

836
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,870
we are not going to go into detail about what are

837
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,490
all those that jerry weir then numbers

838
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,440
and blah blah but let's say there are

839
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,140
as a series of pre-conditions that the

840
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,500
call has to fulfill and then there

841
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,150
was the logic that there is on

842
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,140
simplifying it just to make

843
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,640
the logic to make the emission of the

844
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,130
xanax tics simpler if then someone was going to

845
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,360
call this function that they see that  It is

846
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,650
a public function, anyone could

847
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,330
call it as long as these preconditions are met,

848
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,670
know there is a

849
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,960
quantity of this tree, it speaks

850
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,059
, the energy emission is going to be given and it

851
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:02,679
enters a ford loop where basically

852
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:04,570
we are saying well, let's continue emitting

853
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,520
all the suns and that  This person

854
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,770
is asking us to invite now,

855
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,970
although there are in the preconditions they have

856
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,610
things like mouth that the current amount

857
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,799
of gasoline is not greater than the amount of

858
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,789
This maxim that we had said at the

859
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:17,890
beginning that there must be that this

860
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,570
amount of an explanation in this

861
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,750
transaction is between 0 and 20 is that the

862
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,640
price that is that of the ether that is being

863
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,929
sent the transaction is the ether

864
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,340
necessary if the person is paying

865
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,950
this  increase, that's why they are afis and some

866
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,630
other preconditions and after this

867
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,490
this logic is lying healthy if

868
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,929
we are going to go then we are going to delve

869
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:37,779
a little into this and we are going to talk about

870
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:40,690
this function says 6 min in this function

871
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,460
is an internal function is  say no

872
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,470
anyone can not be called only

873
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,669
inside one when the other no

874
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:47,470
internal functions that is not exposed is not in

875
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,809
the public api of the contract and there

876
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:51,460
internally back we have a

877
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,350
call to an internal merge that says

878
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,090
min and an internal merge that says that

879
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,120
with exercise antonio juanri if for

880
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,980
some reason this standard with simile of

881
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,080
anamnesis is this call to this

882
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,330
function check with jerzy new and research center

883
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,850


884
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,039
then what happens  We are going to go into a little

885
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,260
more detail

886
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,520
these other functions follow

887
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,520
private droughts or we are not deep enough

888
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,380
into the logic of the contract we

889
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,640
are not going to go into detail but we do

890
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,980
understand that here what is happening

891
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,110
is an external call to a

892
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,910
potentially malicious contract in that  that

893
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,760
was highlighted there what is

894
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,190
happening there is this person can

895
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,110
call this function of my internet that and

896
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,850
when the internal logic goes through the

897
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,190
entire thread of execution it reaches this

898
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,169
point where an

899
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:39,840
external call to a potentially

900
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,940
malicious contract is executed because  It is still to the bazi pan of

901
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,250
the person who called this the live the

902
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,440
person to the account that called this

903
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,260
contract if that happens because the standard

904
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,870
the a nafti specifies that that

905
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,789
logic has to be achieved in that way then

906
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,710
we go with a hub  that has the standard

907
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,760
network the one of the energy is this 7 21

908
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,900
so so that we stay a little

909
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,909
with that is type ok there is an

910
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:04,679
external call a contract with really

911
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,029
m  It is attractive that it affects after the

912
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,220
execution of this function that

913
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,409
an attacker can be an attacker with this simplifying it is

914
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:12,539
basically to have a contract attackers

915
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,100
saw that I told you previously that

916
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,870
an attacker can have

917
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,220
attacker contact well this is done with a

918
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,960
contract to stick before then there is a

919
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,720
attacking contract that is controlled by

920
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,570
an account an attacker

921
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,820
obviously can call this mini function in

922
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,720
active and at the end when it comes to this

923
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,759
they will put this external call

924
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:35,039
the attacker can make the

925
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,110
victim contract call the attacker again

926
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,940
against  the contractor starts to have

927
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,860
the execution thread again, he can execute

928
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,679
arbitrary code and re-enters

929
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,360
this call min internet fit and

930
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,610
so on many times and that is how it

931
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,110
was something that is an attack of the day they

932
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,610
enter if the smartphone tracks are

933
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,440
just beginning  To read about smart contract security,

934
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,909


935
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:56,279
the first thing to read is

936
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,470
rian transit base attacks with a call from

937
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,570
Inbound say the attacker starts

938
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,190
calling the victim contract the victim contract

939
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,350
ends up calling

940
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,059
the attacker's contract again and that goes into a

941
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:09,029
loop and through that logic the

942
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,350
attacker can execute interesting things

943
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,750


944
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,220
and

945
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,320
[Music]

946
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,240
in the case of this particular one if this

947
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,159
The attack would have occurred when

948
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,480
20 skis were still to be cleaned

949
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,490
for a series of reasons that were more

950
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,710
like embedded in business logic,

951
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,649
what the attacker can do then is

952
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:30,720
call when 20 are missing, call for me to love

953
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,299
me 20 and the victim contract him

954
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,250
he calls again and there he calls him again

955
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,039
for 2019 and there for them to

956
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,870
carry this circle then one day 20

957
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,529
19 18 and 7 and 6 and there were only 20 left

958
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:44,789
but whatever this rien transit attack and

959
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,070
the victims contract had no logic  or

960
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,480
in these preconditions that I showed you

961
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,100
here, I did

962
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,990
not have a necessary logic for

963
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,110
this to prevent the contract from the

964
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,549
attacking contract executing

965
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:59,490
this logic of calls between  Before, in a

966
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,460
single transaction, be this and the impact

967
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,409
is that in theory with this attack,

968
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,280
200 in 210 estimates could be issued but

969
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,690
in practice it was a little less because

970
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,829
there are certain limitations of the

971
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:12,239
transactions in the ternium network and

972
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,770
as you are the  blocks of the

973
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,300
block and there is something called gas

974
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,629
that does not seek to maintain the third which

975
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:19,579
is limited in practice as

976
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,168
theoretically there was a certain impact

977
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:23,659
but in practice it was quite

978
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,418
lower in which this will happen but hey

979
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:28,549
he researcher that ends  Finding and

980
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:31,099
reporting this takes 12 25k

981
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:33,679
so it is not so bad no

982
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,109
and we go to the last one because this talk was

983
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:38,839
called a visionary from zero

984
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:40,579
visionary we started from zero and

985
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,079
we are not talking about the billionaire so

986
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,829
let's talk now about the millionaire bounty

987
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:46,690
this happened in a protocol that  we are

988
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,690
sushi swap they had a new component

989
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,418
that was this initiates the swiss sushi

990
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:56,170
offering whatever that is

991
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,970
this function exposed in a contract

992
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,910
true says c  As if it means that

993
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,580
there was what it was, there was an auction in

994
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,650
this contract and people could send to

995
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,690
prescribe through this function that is

996
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,660
public and you could deposit ether as

997
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,550
to participate in the auction it was not an

998
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,109
action then you could not say that the

999
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:18,320
committee or so much ether in this auction

1000
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,000
beyond the details and the syntax

1001
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,050
of the request and what is happening

1002
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,510
exactly here haile today we can say

1003
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,100
that it is doing three things the first

1004
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,430
is to calculate it

1005
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,950
says when is how much ether of all the

1006
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,640
ether sent can be deposited  If

1007
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,170
that is, one sends a certain amount of

1008
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,819
ether and there I contract, but first I

1009
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:40,470
notice that of everything you are

1010
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,300
sending me, how much can you really

1011
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,730
deposit your theme, it sends you 100, you can

1012
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,349
use the 100 capable I will deposit

1013
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:48,930
less, which is if it was indeed

1014
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,910
It is possible at that time to deposit the

1015
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,339
ether, which makes note there is an

1016
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:56,020
internal call that will be undertaken and the

1017
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,730
stations how to update the

1018
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,170
internal balances that the co  Deposits contract to

1019
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,569
say how much deposit each

1020
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:03,120
account for

1021
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,340
and the third step was this that is in

1022
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,960
those last three lines is to continue until

1023
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,260
the end says ok yes that but something is to

1024
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,910
say commander they are only able to

1025
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,920
deposit 50 shots here I return the

1026
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,900
50 that what  I have to return you because

1027
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,030
you could not deposit what is

1028
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,590
giving you the overturn that you paid and is

1029
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,960
giving you change in what sounded quite

1030
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,500
simple

1031
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,660
but there was an additional function in this

1032
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,759
contract exposed to which you could

1033
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:32,200
send the will that I made this  o

1034
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,539
Bach I know that the logic is getting more and more

1035
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,519
complicated but I want us to stay

1036
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:39,160
with the idea that they had a function that will

1037
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,140
allow making batch calls, that is,

1038
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,559
as a set of calls to the same

1039
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,269
contracts and then that if I wanted to

1040
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:48,339
make many coming from ether to us  I called the

1041
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,009
committee multiple times, it is simply

1042
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:53,680
called a single time to bach and I kind of

1043
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,869
put many more internal flames in that

1044
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:59,829
function because of how this works because of how I

1045
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:01,960
was ma  Needed the amount of ether that

1046
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,910
one sent to the bach function, what

1047
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:07,089
allowed us to do this was to commit

1048
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,089
the ether n times and pay only once I paid

1049
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:13,070
only once that was paid

1050
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,160
100 every now and then called the bach function

1051
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,380
but if you killed 100 calls  To the

1052
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,330
empty function with only 100 it ended up

1053
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,520
executing 100 calls instead of

1054
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,420
paying 100% true

1055
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,240
then as it goes n times and it paid

1056
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,330
only once once these reached the

1057
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,830
limit because this was a connection and

1058
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,750
it means that there was a  increase because of

1059
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,700
how the logic is given that it sees a

1060
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,880
maximum amount of ether that can be reached what

1061
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,560
the contract gave it was good for a

1062
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,350
month to be sending and now I have

1063
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,150
to return it to you because I tell you I have to

1064
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,430
return it and if they go demand this  one hundred and

1065
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,930
you can't send more then I'll give you back,

1066
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,510
I feel then that logic integrated with

1067
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,000
these batch call functions,

1068
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,340
what ends up happening was that the

1069
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,770
attacker could pay once and they

1070
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,740
began to steal everyone and everything  or the ether

1071
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,090
that was already deposited by other

1072
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,980
people in the contract in the form of a raffle,

1073
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,810
that is, in a returned form that

1074
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,490
the contract gave

1075
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,800
to see it a

1076
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,780
little easier with a very simple diagram,

1077
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,010
let's imagine that this is the amount of

1078
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,270
ether that had the contract at that

1079
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,630
time,

1080
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,270
then it was from 0 to the full maximum,

1081
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,890
there was a certain amount of commitments

1082
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,600
that had already happened, a

1083
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,080
close amount had already been deposited at

1084
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,150
the moment the attacker calls this

1085
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,670
function or could finally call it

1086
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,930
by the attacker  I could call this

1087
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,580
function send a certain amount that

1088
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,090
will exceed that limit, grab it, they raffle that

1089
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,790
there is excess up there that raffle the

1090
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,050
contract will understand that they have

1091
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,300
to return it to you then they will remove it from

1092
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,520
their balance but this also has a

1093
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,320
so-called pothole then  He is going to take that

1094
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,820
raffle and that he is going to return all of them

1095
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,020
each time and what is being

1096
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,910
done is to remove all the ether, they change

1097
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,390
the contract

1098
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,099
and

1099
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,619
this allows b  well I end up in

1100
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,089
a game over the balance the attacker

1101
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,920
ends up making all the initial balance

1102
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,019
that robots have contracts all the ether

1103
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:05,029
that is deposited and there was no

1104
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:07,400
trivial amount of ether in the contract

1105
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,729
there was more than 350 billion

1106
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:13,309
dollars deposited in this contract

1107
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,650
which made it quite complicated

1108
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,319
if someone finally executed

1109
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:20,660
this attack in maynas, that is, with the

1110
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,279
ternium production environment, a

1111
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,380
well-known researcher, the Samsung ecosystem,

1112
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,789
ends up finding this

1113
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:30,410
vulnerability and ends up reporting it,

1114
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,670
luckily given the amount of ether

1115
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,529
that had  Slab of funds at the end of the

1116
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:38,269
day that was available to grab

1117
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:40,420
over 350 million dollars

1118
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,279
reports this vulnerability and takes

1119
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:46,530
a bounty of one million dollars

1120
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,260
for the assistance he gave in discovering and

1121
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,330
mitigating because he was also very involved

1122
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,700
in mitigation to save  that money

1123
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,580
many times is not only to report a

1124
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,230
vulnerability today but also to

1125
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,740
know  How to save the money that is at

1126
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,210
risk through vulnerability with

1127
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,220
a driver that is also something

1128
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,830
quite interesting is not a

1129
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,180
necessary requirement but it

1130
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,250
ends up happening many times that the researchers

1131
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,140
end up helping the developers

1132
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,650
how to suffocate this

1133
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,640
because well there is a lot of the  amount of

1134
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,860
view that is at stake so well

1135
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,180
it ends where this one goes still has a

1136
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,650
million I think it is the side and the largest one

1137
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,570
that was paid at least center yum in this

1138
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,640
ecosystem so far

1139
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,130
so far we are how an exploit would look

1140
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,510
if you want to see a  Exploit in an

1141
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,850
exploit published on this they will have

1142
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,810
friends and they can see the truth that it is

1143
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,990
quite yes yes they understand a touch it

1144
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,730
is quite trivial how to do an

1145
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,260
exploit is the truth that it is very easy

1146
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,140
and there are much more advanced things

1147
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,520
then you will see  the code that is

1148
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,000
not that complicated and nothing is a product

1149
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,640
that executes it and they see how I know how to be bots

1150
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,730
then we can close and we will

1151
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,500
talk about c  How do I start to learn all

1152
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,620
these things and it is here that I leave you a

1153
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,540
very simple link that I promise you is a

1154
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,240
short to have behind there is nothing weird

1155
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,060
enter there and I have a whole list of

1156
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,420
things to start learning there is in

1157
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,790
fact yes alá in Spanish  There is an

1158
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,530
introductory course in Spanish published that you

1159
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,970
can start to learn about

1160
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:22,070
smartphone hacking Dracs from scratch said out

1161
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,890
of nowhere and from there you can

1162
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,020
go up to books challenges

1163
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,040
tools for gloves and there I say

1164
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,370
there already list 22 two platforms quite enough

1165
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,319
interesting to save gloves

1166
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:39,690
all the smart with hacker tracks not if

1167
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,979
I have hacker one ready but I know that in

1168
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:43,199
hacker one too many projects

1169
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:45,420
have I think makers especially in the

1170
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,130
world who have published stamina and smart

1171
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,770
with tracks and other companies too

1172
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,530
and well there they are  ready some others that

1173
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,930
are also available to

1174
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,970
browse if you want to start with there

1175
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,280
are a lot of resources and you do and

1176
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,600
others

1177
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,970
to start talking about for

1178
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,200
start learning about smart with

1179
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,490
back tracks hopefully this talk will serve a

1180
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,100
bit to get you excited about the idea

1181
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,810
so the learning curve may be a

1182
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,210
little more complex and more

1183
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,830
technology that we are exposed to

1184
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,890
every day

1185
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,869
but hey it seems that  there is a lot to

1186
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,339
do there is a lot of room to grow

1187
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:20,660
in the 'barons' and they are just

1188
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,829
getting started and I think this that I

1189
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:24,650
show you today is the tip of the iceberg of

1190
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,269
a much bigger thing that is going to

1191
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:27,859
happen in the next few years regarding

1192
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:30,079
This so it seems to me like in two reis

1193
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,700
interesting to start dedicating this

1194
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,670
type of thing and learning how good it is

1195
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,500
in those economic incentives

1196
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,660
also for those who are interested in

1197
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,450
starting to play with this so that is

1198
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,010
all we are ending here there you have  my

1199
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,850
