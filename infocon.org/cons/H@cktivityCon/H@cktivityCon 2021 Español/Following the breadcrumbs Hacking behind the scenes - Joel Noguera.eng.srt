1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,720
Well thanks to you and thanks to

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,120
everyone who is here,

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,770
these talks first and foremost is

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,580
good it was part of the clau shinkin out

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,710
the lab and berlin sites a couple of

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,360
weeks ago but there will be a good

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,640
opportunity to bring it and give it

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,560
in Spanish also so that it also

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,120
reaches a little to this part of the

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,190
community that sometimes goes unnoticed

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,310
when the talks are in English

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,829
so well I hope you enjoy it

13
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:35,239
for those who do not know me my name is

14
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,550
I will give it to you I am from Argentina I am a founder

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,859
and security research the software are

16
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,469
waits security

17
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:46,600
but I have been in the

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,730
security field for a long time working in

19
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,819
companies such as deloitte and munitis although

20
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,559
lately I have been focusing a

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,690
lot on what is games and river

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,149
without and trying to give a little that contribution

23
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,850
from that side  and of course I have a cat

24
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,150
that is also a hunter so he is not far

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,390
behind

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,360
let me explain a little of this

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,000
talk and that is that basically we are not going to

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,729
find an answer  s in this talk

29
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,170
because what we are going to be doing is

30
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,350
talking about questions so let me

31
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,810
show you this explain it to you with something

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,060
that happened to me a couple of months ago

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,729
at the end of May approximately I released

34
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:30,790
an advisor and with a one click

35
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,649
remote wagon consequence in  an application

36
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:35,020
for gamers that is widely used in the

37
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,689
world of gaming in the 1920s and the reality

38
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,850
is that luckily

39
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,530
this bay shore stand had a lot of movement and it

40
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,390
appeared published in news portals such

41
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,140
as the daily switch

42
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,540
and emails began to reach me but

43
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,100
something  interesting that I began to notice in

44
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,200
those emails is that many of the

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,940
questions that came to me were of this

46
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,280
style if they were questions like how can I

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,590
start to learn from this how can I

48
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,900
find bucks this style what would be

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,850
the way to learn and start

50
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,729
trying to use  techniques of this style or

51
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,310
that I can use as a resource

52
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,258
to understand what is happening

53
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,160
then I started to think and I realized

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,750
that the reality that  and I still

55
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,390
think about those questions because

56
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,880
when I read another write up when trying

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,620
to learn a new technique or many

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,730
times because when I was trying that

59
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,500
I want an application and tries to say

60
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,480
well how do I learn how

61
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,090
I can understand and find a way  learning

62
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,920


63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,110
so thinking about this I

64
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,730
realize that out there many times those

65
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,590
questions that we ask

66
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,170
ourselves when when we are leaving

67
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,540
'not how we are working reading

68
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,400
that country can be more important than

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,680
that technical knowledge that we already

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,410
have

71
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,750
the main idea  is that what he

72
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,730
asked them to explain is that out there those

73
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,740
questions that we ask ourselves point out

74
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,140
those gaps or those boats or that

75
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,870
ignorance that we do not have that

76
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,240
we have better said and that once we

77
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,010
can find an answer or

78
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,440
we can understand that emptiness  if we

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,730
find an answer they will

80
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,310
show us new opportunities or paths

81
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,640
to follow if you remember  nse that every

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,020
time we are working

83
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,780
hacking reading we are learning and

84
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,510
there is a learning curve that

85
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,220
will always be present there yes I like to

86
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,860
think that every time I start a new

87
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,300
project that I start to hack for

88
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,560
example a web application one

89
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,180
stop application I like to think that

90
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,400
I am like a hub and in that sense and that

91
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,840
as I start to interact with the

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,150
application and start using it I start to

93
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,190
understand a little and I start to gain

94
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,170
knowledge and go through that

95
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,720
learning curve and the reality that  learn

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,790
there are a couple of sayings that we have to be

97
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,140
honest learning is difficult takes time

98
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,980
effort

99
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,050
and is endless if there is so much

100
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,090
knowledge out there that if

101
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,709
we now grab a new application that

102
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,360
we do not know and start to see which

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,940
frameworks use what technology

104
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,680
we will never be able to learn  all that

105
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,599
knowledge is actually being able to

106
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,450
find the best way to go through

107
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,640
that learning curve and get

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,049
ahead if you  Then an approach that I

109
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:17,449
normally use that I like to use to be

110
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,209
able to find those paths to

111
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,690
go through those curves and advance is first of

112
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,639
all for example separating the problem

113
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,560
into bits and those pieces can be

114
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,120
anything if we are talking about

115
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,250
a web application it

116
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,870
can be a  feature or a

117
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,729
functionality of that application may

118
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:40,490
be a functionality of a framework

119
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,979
that an application is using or it may

120
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,289
be technical knowledge that

121
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,870
I do not have and it is an attack type or it is something

122
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,850
else that I need to learn in order to

123
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,280
move forward

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,139
if then what  I do is focus on

125
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,639
one of those components out there, the most

126
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,380
obvious or the main one, and start asking myself

127
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,570
questions about how it is built, how it

128
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,060
works, how it interacts with the rest of

129
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,430
the application, then as I

130
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,530
find these answers, these

131
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,510
answers will show me others.

132
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,730
components and they also give me and

133
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,889
showing me how those

134
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,650
components interact with each other

135
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,870
then  out there if I was on the

136
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,419
right path if I asked the right questions

137
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,550
and those answers helped me out there

138
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,440
I can find some way that

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,390
will generate that, for example, possible

140
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,700
attack vector or that technique that I am

141
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,700
looking for or that which I am trying to

142
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,759
learn and then

143
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,410
Basically what I am proposing here

144
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,380
is that we use these questions as a

145
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,080
learning engine and that we use those

146
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,169
questions about each component to see

147
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:46,970
that those crumbs give us those clues

148
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,650
that will let us go

149
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,800
down a path that could

150
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,330
lead us to some vector of  attack a

151
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,990
knowledge or something better if then what

152
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,669
I want to do now is use two

153
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,130
bugs that

154
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,020
I found previously to

155
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,509
show you a little based on those two

156
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,550
sites how this

157
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,220
methodology works that I am proposing

158
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,040
then the first bar is this that I

159
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,960
comment here  that I was just commenting on the

160
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,880
advisor and that it is a one click remote

161
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,740
codisec and vision is an application that  ue

162
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,270
is called robert wolf so that those who

163
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,250
play for children like world of warcraft put

164
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,890
pressure on this application is used a lot

165
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,620
to integrate plugins into the game

166
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,409
yes

167
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:32,119
then we are going to see the stern first of all

168
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:34,069
if here what we have is the

169
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,449
application on the left  and to the right

170
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,550
we have a browser when the user

171
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,849
accepts this popup, what will happen is

172
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:43,470
that the application is going to be executed

173
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,410
, a cross ai scripting client side attack will be generated

174
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,360
in this application

175
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,720
and through a bypass of certain

176
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,670
security measures that  you are going to see it will be possible

177
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,400
to execute codes within the

178
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,370
application without a rhythm to follow

179
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,360
then well for now this is all

180
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,160
we need now but what we

181
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
have here would be like the general view

182
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,480
of 11 lover view of all the vector

183
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,710
of  attacks and here we have all the

184
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,290
components we have how they interact with

185
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,110
each other and we have everything we need

186
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,660
for it for the vector but the reality

187
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,160
is that when we start to

188
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,050
analyze  r these applications do not know

189
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,390
how these components interact and

190
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,680
much less do we know if all those

191
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,500
components exist so let's start

192
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,380
a little from scratch with the most obvious and

193
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,760
start asking these questions

194
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,260
to see where we can go and if

195
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,240
we can go the same way

196
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,819
then the first thing  What we can do is

197
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,650
start with the most obvious component that

198
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,110
would be the over watch executable and

199
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,090
start saying well what languages do I use,

200
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,490
what framework is being used, is there a

201
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,910
framework something like it works if the

202
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,349
content that the user is seeing

203
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,419
as it is rendered this static is there

204
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,880
dynamic content if these questions

205
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,250
will help us to understand that this

206
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,080
application is a chromium in bet

207
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,560
framework and that it will have a browser

208
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,960
embedded within that executable that what

209
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,250
it will be doing is rendering

210
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,259
the content for the user,

211
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,880
part of that content will  It will be static and

212
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,740
it will come, let's say moved with

213
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,990
the application and other content, we will

214
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,150
understand  r that a server is going to come from another

215
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,490
side so that question

216
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,159
helped us to identify out there a new

217
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,139
component that we did not know, yes

218
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,010
excuse me and then that we can

219
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,260
continue to ask, following more questions to

220
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,600
start saying well how does it communicate

221
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,490
which protocol it is using  In this

222
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,860
communication it is safe, we can

223
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,510
somehow see what is being

224
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,400
transmitted, we can promote it,

225
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,760
we can see what the answers are

226
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,380
through these questions and looking for those

227
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,330
answers, we will understand that the

228
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,280
communication is being done through https,

229
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,160
which seems to be secure for now  and that it

230
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,650
is basically sending and receiving

231
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,390
certain information that needs to be

232
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,860
rendered so that the user can

233
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,840
see it and give it the features that

234
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,060
saturation needs but it seemed we did not

235
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,040
ask another question how we can

236
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,080
remotely interact with this process

237
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,940
we are going to understand that a new

238
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,000
component appears that is a  custom new in

239
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,130
handball then the first thing we are going to

240
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,800
do  r is to say that it is a that these

241
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,230
handlers are that we do not know how they work

242
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,930
because this allows us to

243
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,300
remotely invoke the application and what effect does

244
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,570
that execution result if then

245
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,490
once we start asking ourselves these

246
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,080
questions to look for the answers and

247
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,160
understand

248
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,430
to give account that  These are url handlers, it

249
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,290
is a functionality that does not give

250
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,019
windows so that some way a

251
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,209
browser such as chrome or firefox can

252
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,180
invoke applications on the

253
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,399
user's desktop, so every time

254
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,949
we access a url of this

255
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,899
style in the browser, the application  from

256
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:53,449
ourol is going to be invoked and

257
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,370
that's when we have a new interaction and

258
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,379
we can see how a user or an

259
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,509
attacker could start to say good

260
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:01,370
because I can manipulate what

261
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,769
can I do if then we are

262
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,910
also going to ask ourselves these types of questions

263
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,009
let's say well what happens when it is

264
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,410
executed I can produce some

265
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,689
unexpected behavior what is

266
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,959
this going to cause if I enter  nces what, by

267
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,339
re-analyzing and continuing to

268
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:18,019
look for these answers, we will

269
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,610
begin to understand that depending on the

270
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,949
url, we will go here after the

271
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:23,930
colon and the bar bar we will

272
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,579
begin to trigger different

273
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:27,980
processes, different features and different

274
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,420
behaviors within the application

275
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,290
of  oberwart then one of those things

276
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,990
that it generates is that it is going to search for

277
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,000
various contents on the server, there is

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,160
interaction between the application and the being

279
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,950
then we already knew a little about this

280
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,420
interaction now we begin to see

281
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,490
why it is there because it exists then

282
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,950
we ask ourselves again  again what

283
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,450
kind of responses are we receiving

284
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,400
what is the information that is sending us is

285
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,890
there a way to produce

286
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,720
some unexpected behavior for example

287
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,940
in the application if I pass

288
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,400
some url that the application itself

289
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,770
is not expecting and well in reality is

290
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,420
that once  As we begin to try to

291
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,520
find these answers, we are going to understand

292
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,190
that it is possible in a certain way.  do and under

293
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,500
certain conditions to be able to do a cross

294
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,320
site scripting within that

295
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,500
embedded desert browser that the user has on

296
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,080
their computer, then first of all

297
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,670
we start to do is learn about

298
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,320
script things and start asking

299
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,620
ourselves questions such as how dangerous is this

300
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,680
in a  application of this style this is

301
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,940
the same as a web

302
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,830
application context and we have to begin to

303
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,140
understand also about techniques and

304
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,420
attacks for web applications since

305
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,280
this is a typical web application vector

306
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,410
then

307
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,779
again learning and seeing this

308
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,819
we will understand that this cross  site

309
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,379
scripting in some way will

310
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,319
help us, it will allow us to control

311
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,690
what is all the content that

312
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,550
the user is performing as well as the actions

313
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,850
that are being generated but we will see

314
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,290
that there are also limitations if it will not

315
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,060
let us go further  go ahead and for

316
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,519
example run a calculator or do

317
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,860
rhythm all that course then again

318
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,029
we wonder what these are

319
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:10,459
limitations and why they exist and we are going to

320
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,779
understand that a new component appears

321
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,509
which is the sandbox of sets and these

322
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,449
frameworks that are developed in the

323
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:20,149
ashlar, sorry and are planted have these

324
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,060
unbox in drink that basically

325
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,290
protects the user in some way then

326
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,569
again we generate these  Questions

327
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:28,759
of why this sandbox exists, how does it

328
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,889
work, is there a way to escape

329
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,870
the default by the layers that is

330
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,699
outdated and we can use some, I

331
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,960
explained you are known,

332
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,350
then understanding this and

333
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,720
thinking about this problem we are going to

334
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,190
find in the answers that it

335
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,650
is basically there for  protect the

336
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,090
user from attacks of this style so

337
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,320
then you are fulfilling its

338
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,780
functionality but at the same time we

339
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,270
can also ask ourselves if it gives us some

340
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,310
interaction for example with some other

341
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,890
component then there we will

342
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,780
realize that we were missing a

343
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,330
part and that is that there is something  which is called

344
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,030
nate and pipián if this application is

345
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,200
app and native e  s is there and it is a new

346
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,970
component that we did not know and

347
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,800
through these questions and questioning ourselves

348
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,690
why we are all going to

349
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,990
discover this way so then again

350
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,390
we say well how this app works and

351
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,310
how it is built that the language

352
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,490
is being used  what files it provides

353
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,230
and why it can communicate with what

354
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,030
is inside both then

355
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,250
again to start answering these

356
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,650
questions we are going to see that this app and it

357
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,340
will be developing what it is to sign in

358
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,130
native code and the squares as well and

359
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,570
stay  portion of that code that is

360
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,560
also going to be a

361
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
script embedded within the browser,

362
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,330
then we begin to analyze that code,

363
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,279
we begin to understand how it works by

364
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,740
reading the documentation and we begin to

365
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,510
see that there are features that we can

366
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,240
invoke and that will allow us to interact

367
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,970
in some way with  that app then what

368
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,620
can we do with those files could

369
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,570
be for example an example question

370
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,480
and it is good once we have features  to

371
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,860
let write a file on disk

372
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,990
then we say well we can invoke

373
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,390
this option if it allows us to

374
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,279
create the file some type of

375
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,220
particular file has some limitation

376
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,050
for example I can put any

377
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,650
content in that file or I have some

378
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,190
extension that for example cannot

379
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,380
create  And the answer is that in reality

380
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,210
there is no restriction for this

381
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,160
functionality and that it will allow us to

382
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,620
create any file with any

383
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,540
extension and with any content as

384
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,670
long as the application obviously

385
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,680
has privileges to write in that

386
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,720
director, so well, great,

387
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,520
we are out there a  step by at

388
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,690
least we are somehow

389
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,910
interacting with the operating system

390
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,080
the question is that it is enough for us to

391
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,740
generate

392
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,590
an excursion rhythm not yet because

393
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,510
we have created the file but we do not have

394
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,930
how to execute it then if we

395
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,490
ask ourselves questions about the app again and

396
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,260
there  We can find some answer

397
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,260
to this and the answer too  It is there and

398
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,210
it goes to us and we will end up understanding

399
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,800
that if there was another file, another

400
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,240
functionality that allows us to execute

401
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,910
any file within the system

402
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,680
then maybe we can combine these

403
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,530
two things, maybe we can use this

404
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,710
execution to execute the file that

405
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,100
we just created and the  The answer is yes,

406
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,110
that features and we pass it

407
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,660
a url to execute a browser but if

408
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,420
we pass it a bat point to execute the

409
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,670
windows bat point script so

410
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,000
that way we can combine those two

411
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,950
functionalities those two functionalities

412
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,420
to get to what  It is rhythm he dismissed

413
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,090
and then after going all this

414
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,980
way of asking new questions we are going to

415
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,740
make a summary of what happened and

416
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,150
we start to ask ourselves things

417
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,170
we start to ask about the framework

418
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,060
on the language we start to

419
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,860
ask ourselves what are the things that

420
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,930
we are finding  like custom and see

421
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,870
handlers and cross site scripting and

422
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,520
as we asked those questions we were

423
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,350
discovering new components and

424
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,320
finding that path that ended up

425
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,860
leading us to this attack on this vector,

426
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,250
let's see these same ones but with another back

427
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,160
so we can explain the same about others with

428
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,010
other different backs and then

429
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,810
we are going to start making an analogy of

430
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,640
how it can help us to  this type of

431
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,910
questions

432
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,650
this second back is also in the same

433
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,480
application towards the senator work but at

434
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,150
this moment we will be

435
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,830
focusing, let's say, on what the

436
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,690
update process is without doing another

437
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,090
different process that will work,

438
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,410
we will see when but what  It is going to be

439
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,670
invoked and it has some good

440
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,380
ability that will allow us to get to the

441
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,200
towed description in another way

442
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,680
then again here we have the stern

443
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,810
what is going to be done basically is going to

444
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,000
be a people in the middle an attack

445
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,730
to intercept the traffic of  that way

446
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,589
we go if we are standing between

447
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,360
what is the client and the server we are going

448
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,699
to make the client believe that we

449
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,980
are the serv  idor and we are going to send

450
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,230
some malicious binaries to be

451
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,849
executed for us thinking that in the

452
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,030
new version of bauru to all this we are going

453
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,559
to have to empty again some

454
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,709
local restrictions to be able to arrive

455
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,750
and successfully carry out that attack

456
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,609
here we can see it is that once  When the

457
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,949
download is finished, there will be a new

458
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:27,839
file that will be created on the disk,

459
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,210
yes and that will be created as the system user,

460
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,470
which is the most

461
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,980
privileged user that is in windows, yes,

462
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,190
so let's go back to this

463
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,010
graphic if they pay  Attention, you are going to see

464
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,960
that it was no longer graphic because

465
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,030
we were already going through that

466
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,010
learning curve, we already know things

467
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,500
about golf so we know that

468
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,840
there is a sep application that runs

469
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,610
on the client side and using level

470
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,020
we also know that there is a server and it is

471
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,190
knowledge  that out there can help

472
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,630
us in this new path that we are

473
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,470
trying to travel,

474
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,240
let's start back with the questions:

475
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,620
how does tree work?  ol in that sense, how

476
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,169
is it updated, is there any other process that

477
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:09,629
interacts, is

478
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,690
there any way that this application

479
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,919
also interacts with other things in the

480
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,720
system, then as we

481
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,399
begin to ask these questions, which

482
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,320
may be this or any other, so

483
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,029
that we come to understand that  There is a

484
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:25,029
new binary, a new process that is going

485
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:27,100
to take care of the update

486
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,789
of this application, yes then again

487
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:33,370
we wonder what languages I use in

488
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,860
a framework that is being used, what

489
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,200
is it that starts this process or how it

490
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,059
starts and how it starts.  handles the update of

491
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:43,059
this process and here we are going to understand

492
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,929
what the updater is, let's say, by robert

493
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,940
wolf to be written in sillar which is

494
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,409
custom in this case it was not using

495
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,809
any framework but it is going to have a

496
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:54,669
lot of logic inside that we are going to

497
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,169
have to  analyze to understand

498
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,789
what is happening when we

499
00:18:57,789 --> 00:18:59,740
ask ourselves who is the one who starts this

500
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,710
process we are going to start with two options

501
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,100
one we go to  er what is robert

502
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,600
wolf himself that is going to execute that

503
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,460
application every time it starts to

504
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,190
look for updates and the other

505
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,540
we will also see that it is a

506
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,490
new component that we did not know that it is the

507
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,550
windows service control if it is another tool

508
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,710
that we  It could be used to invoke this

509
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,260
process and paris in an on a path of a

510
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,270
privilege escalation It could be

511
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,790
good for us that those fictions time yes but in

512
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,620
this case as or verbs it does it

513
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,510
automatically we will go down that other

514
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,040
path that looks happier

515
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,740
then  When we ask ourselves

516
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,200
how this logic works, that code in

517
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
ashlar that we found previously,

518
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,240
we are going to begin to understand that there are a

519
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,610
lot of things that are happening but

520
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,610
one mainly and that is that it needs to

521
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,440
attract the new version, it needs to first

522
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,720
validate which is the one that is installed

523
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,060
which is  the last one available and

524
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,770
download it

525
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,180
then again there will be a

526
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,940
communication with that server that we

527
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,000
already know

528
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,360
so if we go back to pr  To ask and

529
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,730
try to analyze this communication,

530
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,170
we begin to say well what protocol is

531
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,840
being used, is it safe, is there any way to

532
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,420
intercept it, manipulate it and what we are going

533
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,270
to see in this case is that the

534
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,020
application is communicating via http,

535
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,090
which is communicating in place text and

536
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,710
not  It is a less secure communication channel

537
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,690
for a

538
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,160
privileged application that is running as a

539
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,000
system within the system so then

540
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,350
we can intercept and manipulate this

541
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,710
traffic and potentially if

542
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,410
we are in the right place somewhere

543
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,180
between the client and the

544
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,600
server.  out there we can somehow

545
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,910
stop and intercept that traffic if

546
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,190
we intercept it

547
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,870
we could manipulate it and try to

548
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,990
get something else the reality is that

549
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,270
we have to begin to understand and start

550
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,190
asking ourselves questions about

551
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,200
how these attacks work to intercept

552
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,660
the traffic what kind of options are there  and

553
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,060
which of those can not serve once we

554
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,520
learn that we will understand  der and come

555
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,320
to the conclusion that for example an

556
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,830
attacker who is in the lnd in

557
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,540
the same local network for example that

558
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,240
user that the victim could perform

559
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,200
what is an erp skin or poisoning for

560
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,420
what is to make the client believe that

561
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,310
we  we are the server if then

562
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,710
the next time

563
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,929
when the client starts trying to

564
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:33,549
communicate with the server it will

565
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:35,830
communicate with the attacker and then

566
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,309
we can use this to manipulate the

567
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:40,390
traffic

568
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,710
we can see that traffic is being

569
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,990
sent the response is if we can

570
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,190
see it we can  see that the server responds

571
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,809
urls for where to download the latest

572
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,059
versions as well as returns what

573
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:58,299
are the mc5 the zoom the check zoom to

574
00:21:58,299 --> 00:21:59,980
validate that that user that file was

575
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,610
born manipulated in the middle then

576
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,260
this is enough us if we can

577
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,659
replace that url it is enough to

578
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,120
We like to be able to do a remake

579
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,800
or discussion in the application

580
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,070
and the answer to mentally is no

581
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,690
because to appear two new

582
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,240
co  Components that will be

583
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,190
limiting us and that will be protecting

584
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,600
the user so that we cannot

585
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,740
do that so easily if then

586
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,600
again what do we do when we have a

587
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,460
new component or something that we do not know

588
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,410
we begin to ask ourselves questions and

589
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,510
we begin to say well how

590
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,490
This sex works as valid the

591
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,850
expected version of that sex with which

592
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,220
the new file is calculated there is some

593
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,500
way to empty the one to create a collision

594
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,330
to deceive the update process

595
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,800
well the reality is that if they paid

596
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
attention they would have realized that the

597
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,350
sex  It also came in the answers I

598
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,840
commented then that it could be an

599
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,050
attacker is not only replacing the url from

600
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,060
where to download that file but it

601
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,710
could also replace what would be the sex

602
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,980
then this process

603
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,730
will begin to calculate the sex by calculating

604
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,830
the sex of the malicious binary and

605
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,450
Compare it with the one that came from the server

606
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,580
as both are being transmitted through a

607
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,690
channel and surely we will be able to empty that

608
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,720
cont  role is this enough again not

609
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,450
because we have a second control that is

610
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,520
a file signature control if then

611
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,370
we start again to analyze and

612
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,900
ask ourselves questions about that component

613
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,740
how it works as it validates the

614
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,929
file's certificate what it does or what it

615
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:43,400
consists of.

616
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,960
certificate that is

617
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,270
waiting then once we

618
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,890
start to ask ourselves this type of thing

619
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,960
we will understand that what it does is see

620
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,140
with which certificate that binary was signed

621
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,419
and actually if it is the

622
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:59,120
gold certificate works then that

623
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,490
way they can validate that  only over

624
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,220
wolf is generating those binaries and only

625
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,870
to execute binaries generated by

626
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,850
them but also when we

627
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,490
ask ourselves how things like how

628
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,340
this is integrated with the operating system,

629
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,860
how could we use a

630
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,080
certificate signed by ourselves

631
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,330
and for example put that over wolf signed it

632
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,150
Although it is all to leave many

633
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,610
times it is not valid, it works for him in

634
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,429
this case the curious thing and  I know that if it works

635
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:30,980
and why why because when we

636
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,380
start to analyze this component and

637
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,960
understand how it is integrated with the

638
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,210
operating system and reconcile we are going to

639
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,030
start to learn that they are

640
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,580
using a function, a function of ashlar

641
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,620
that is not the one indicated  and that it will only

642
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,049
validate the name of the sap jet but it will not

643
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:49,640
care if that file is

644
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,770
signed by a corresponding authority

645
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,910
or if it is self sign as in our case

646
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,140
and in this case when we ask ourselves if

647
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,120
the answer is enough

648
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,299
Yes, by putting all those clues together, those

649
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:03,610
crumbs that we have been finding,

650
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,380
we could find what this

651
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,150
second back would be and another way to make

652
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,380
rhythms codhes exclusions in this

653
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,500
application

654
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,600
again here we can see how those

655
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,820
questions generated answers, generated

656
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,910
knowledge and helped us to go

657
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,220
through that  learning curve and

658
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,720
begin to understand what

659
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,400
we needed to be able to continue

660
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,570
progressing on that path

661
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,270
but now  Because you already understand more

662
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,950
or less what I am telling you

663
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,270
about the approach that I am trying

664
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,210
to use,

665
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,830
what do these bucks have in common?

666
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,899
If it is another question that we

667
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,820
can ask ourselves, the reality is that when

668
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,830
I was when I found  those bucks

669
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,990
was not looking for any of those types

670
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,169
of attacks and I started to grab the

671
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,850
application I focused on a component

672
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,770
I began to wonder how that component

673
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,450
worked, it began to ask me that style

674
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,010
of questions that we asked ourselves along that

675
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,549
way and those questions helped me

676
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:02,380
find  Those two bases in particular

677
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,330
but it could have seems like

678
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,490
any other bucks could have appeared and if

679
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,620
there my questions vicencio others or the

680
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,000
answers had also been others

681
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,390
then the main thing is to show them

682
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,250
that out there in this way one is not looking for

683
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,779
a particular pack but  that

684
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,460
a few crumbs are walking there

685
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,100
to

686
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,210
find what one is

687
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,710
looking for and does not know what it is

688
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,870
and another co  What we can ask ourselves is

689
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,419
that they are telling us those questions and

690
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:31,010
that because those questions are so

691
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,980
important

692
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,620
and from my point of view

693
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,210
what stands out in these questions is that

694
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,330
many times what we do not know is that

695
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,000
knowledge that we do not have or that we

696
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,280
do not know what  We do not have can be many

697
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,530
times more important than the things we

698
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,700
already know and that

699
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,429
technical knowledge that we have because once

700
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:53,260
we find the answers or

701
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,210
understand what we do not know we will

702
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,830
discover new things that could

703
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,790
lead us to new paths

704
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,520
of course the  kind of questions that

705
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,200
we are going to ask ourselves and how good

706
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,820
are those questions and with practice and the

707
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,130
more they ask the more they see

708
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,320
similar components or similar applications, the

709
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,260
better their questions will be

710
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,820
and in this case I have given the answers to them

711
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,890
immediately  because everything has

712
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,170
come this way but the reality

713
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,120
is that in real life out there an

714
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,500
answer to these questions can take

715
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,460
my  minutes weeks maybe months without

716
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,500
finding the answer to what

717
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,920
we are asking ourselves like this

718
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,290
and of course there are questions that are

719
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,910
not going to give us satisfactory answers

720
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,040
or we are going to think that they do not

721
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,810
serve us but that is what

722
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,640
those are indicating  The questions is that it is a

723
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,620
path that we should not follow that out there

724
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,560
we have to keep asking ourselves things

725
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,960
in order to find those crumbs and

726
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,720
travel that path that is the correct one and

727
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,160
that is that that new knowledge is going to take us

728
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,740
and that VAT that we are

729
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,130
looking for

730
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,590
and finally what I like to do

731
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,760
is apply it to everything if what I do

732
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,560
with this is apply it to

733
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,750
anything that I like to do and that I need to

734
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,190
learn if for example if I am

735
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,500
hacking a web application, a desktop

736
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,690
or whatever I try to  Following this

737
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,520
methodology, I am also trying to learn,

738
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,740
for example, when I am reading

739
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,320
a guaita on the internet about a new back or

740
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,380
a new technique that has come out many

741
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,550
times.  What I do is start asking

742
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,760
questions that are not in the raid without

743
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,710
if the author mentions a

744
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,000
good framework out there, he begins to ask me

745
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,860
questions about that framework that

746
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,780
will also help me look for

747
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,690
things and read what I need  to

748
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,580
also understand that wright to understand

749
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,770
that technique or that type of attack and to

750
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,830
reproduce it in other applications

751
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,890
so that was all I hope you

752
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,200
liked it and now the last question is if

753
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,520
you have any questions for me
