1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,530
well, we are not going to start doing

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,139
that of victor a canson they found their

3
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:14,360
autonomy is the decade and well the

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,219
first thing that has already introduced me a little

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,770
and under is a little mini presentation

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,680
that is if you study my name is congratulations

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,960
hernández work work in  A

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,870
Spanish company depends on stern and I live in Madrid

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,720
and well, when I feel like it and I

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,930
don't want 2000 because I dedicate myself to looking for a base

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,110
in without approaching and well I have a

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,409
website with a position at iu

13
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:41,899
I insist dotcom that I have a

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,079
page for tips  And as a

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,940
pen testing app, basically I'm going to

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,309
dump a lot of information and

17
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:51,800
then as well as projects that I have that

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,409
I keep on recognizing the wind and

19
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:56,479
that it is a tool to do the

20
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,179
recognition of equal domains over there,

21
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,940
which is how it is.  a repository

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,729
in which I will keep

23
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:07,370
the web ready to jog

24
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,410
and well, now we are going to start

25
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,080
with the talk,

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,250
first we are going to talk a little about the

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,220
concept of subdomains  ios

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,920
seems what the use of finding

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,420
their domains is the first thing when we are

30
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,920
either in an external inclusion bridge

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,760
or in bus hunting the first thing to expand the

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,050
surface

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,380
normally in the programs that

34
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,560
give us an open shield because that we can

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
remove many their domains  With the

36
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,740
aim of expanding the attack surface

37
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,510


38
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,270
then well this is logically an

39
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,620
essential part of the whole process that

40
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,870
we do as a record, we should incorporate

41
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,520
the part of removing sub from the children to

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,770
all our mouse and then also know

43
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,870
that the been domains are usually

44
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,600
descriptive words  in relation to the

45
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,550
functionality or technology that are

46
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,080
used in that subdomain, such

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,140
as if we talk about help point

48
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,150
hacker one.com because we are that this

49
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,520
site will normally be a

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,470
help site for users if we find

51
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,630
the point or whatever, then

52
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,940
Normally, it will normally be the site for

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,310
developers because it is easy

54
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,560
to find their domains.

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,660
It allows in many cases to find their

56
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,390
domains that the company has

57
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,720
forgotten, this many times means that

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,010
we cannot find their

59
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,560
obsolete domains with old software and

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,330
probably vulnerable software at the

61
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,340
time, because out there we will also be

62
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,340
able to have many attack vectors and

63
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,020
then

64
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,490
find their  Domains logically

65
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,600
will allow us

66
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,550
to remove vulnerabilities of types of

67
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,070
fruit mind and cover that are usually

68
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,080
very popular, it has been on twitter and in the

69
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,700
networks in general presumably and covers

70
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,210
but let's

71
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,670
see it is not so easy to find them the same

72
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,440
a while ago yes but how

73
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,300
Now everyone is automating because they

74
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,610
make

75
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,380
two more concepts more complicated and we have already started a little

76
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,210
all the parts of the numbering of their

77
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,130
domains the first thing to be

78
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,960
clear with your domain is not strictly

79
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,600
a website in a subdomain it can be

80
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,580
simply

81
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,350
a  site that is serving a

82
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,630
database or ftp site because they keep

83
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,430
coming across people talking  or of these

84
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,170
issues that take for granted that

85
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,020
subdomains are the same as websites and not and

86
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,880
then

87
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,830
as a rule the subdomains the

88
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,870
characters that may be carried

89
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,210
are the hyphens or the points to

90
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,650
separate different levels of their

91
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,080
domains then with this we are going to

92
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,080
enter the first

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,170
action technique of subdomains that is the

94
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,690
passive way ballet when we list your

95
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,790
domains passively what we do

96
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,220
is delegate to third parties the obtaining of

97
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,650
those subdomains

98
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,910
these subdomains are dedicated to collecting

99
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,820
all that information based on records

100
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,120
of  This to records of

101
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,610
good certificates to a lot of sites us

102
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,710
to be able to obtain the information of

103
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,080
all these third parties what we

104
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,910
do is use either the

105
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,920
official clients that those companies gave us, such

106
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,050
as welding suitcases, has your

107
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,850
saddam client and we can use it

108
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,310
I am going to finish or through scrap

109
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,548
ers that what they do is agglutinate

110
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,260
the calls to all these services  in

111
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,730
such a way that with a single execution

112
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,910
we can consult

113
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,550
all of these services, there are both

114
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,770
free and paid, normally

115
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,690
most have a freak version and a

116
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,490
paid version, the free version, because that

117
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,560
has a series of

118
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,870
data limitations that  We are going to consult for

119
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,990
months, it is worth and the model is that it gives you a

120
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,150
series of tokens, a plan, because a thousand tokens

121
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,370
per month and for every kuri you make of 100

122
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,530
results, it will be five touches

123
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,660
for example then because that is usually

124
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,030
the free version and  Well, there are more than

125
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,820
60 related services that we can

126
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,150
use soon

127
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:58,580
and there are

128
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,500
tools that we can use to

129
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,020
make this type of enumeration of your

130
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,789
abdomen the best known and the most

131
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,430
widespread I believe that it is more to more

132
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,669
apart from the passive part.

133
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,860
brute force and do many

134
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,780
more things but why are we going to

135
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,670
focus now that it is for

136
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,810
the passive technique, it is also the one that

137
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,090
allows the most services to be used voucher has it

138
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,730
has integ  Rados up to 60 and then

139
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,440
well, there go a little the best known

140
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,270
from the point of view of the column, then there

141
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,830
is a fan of the one that has about 40

142
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,500
integrated services find or mail the

143
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,910
free version because it is going

144
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,650
twenty-one payment option has whoever

145
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,610
you are expanding and  well then

146
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,180
logically less

147
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,720
just one interesting thing that gabo out

148
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,120
plus which is a forum with a few

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,220
more functionalities or huelva qr he

150
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,229
really does not give us their domains what they

151
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,380
give us are urls consulted to other

152
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,990
services then return wireless takes it

153
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,449
from  wayback machine and gaut plus out

154
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:03,449
also obtains from huelva which ones, but

155
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:04,889
also consulting, for example, a total virus,

156
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,080
returns us to reveal if

157
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,960
we filter the subdomain, and then

158
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,550
the acrobat tool that is in the

159
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,650
project leaves sonar search that

160
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,380
directly pulls the base of  data from

161
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,259
rapid 7 that of fedeleche is worth this would be

162
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,300
like the tools from a

163
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,360
main or essential point of view when it

164
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,130
comes to getting s  us of union in a

165
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,889
massive way the main sources of the

166
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,930
most general as that are ten in

167
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,599
six spaces s political prisoner almost total

168
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,490
let's say they are the ones that have the most

169
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,960
amount of information that can be

170
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
used for this although although these

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,530
services have more

172
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,690
functionalities  But focusing on

173
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,220
what we are interested in, let's say that these

174
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,139
four are the most interesting in the

175
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,849
event that one day you plant me for

176
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:49,220
some

177
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,230
and then more specific because if

178
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,930
we have a vic hub account we can create

179
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,000
tokens that can be used to make

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
queries and then  bolívar machine that

181
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,410
I have already said facebook if we make a

182
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,120
developer profile we can also

183
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,570
get one here and from there we can

184
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,520
get others from facebook and well something

185
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,750
production and total virus

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,050
here are just some examples

187
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,970
so that if someone has not used

188
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,620
never this type of tools because you can

189
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,870
see a little how

190
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,540
the syntax is launched is both similar

191
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,030
here I have  used against hacker one

192
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,250
that is to name passive elimination before 6

193
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,010
workers there it does

194
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,840
not have much simply because well it

195
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,790
is that they are all very similar and then

196
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,130
this is a screenshot of the

197
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,810
configuration file and also this I have

198
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,510
taken so you can see that in the file

199
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,130
configuration of both hamas and

200
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,860
its trailer and jandro mail

201
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,960
you have to enter our here or

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,360
our credentials or whatever we have

203
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,030
to pay for the services so that this

204
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,040
tool can do the

205
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,480
scripting of each of the services

206
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,400
by then  Well, that and also

207
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,200
by itself or any of these by

208
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,580
itself without registering in a service

209
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,920
not to give information but if we

210
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,930
configure the credentials of the

211
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,910
services and all this we are going to obtain a

212
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,290
system more information which is what

213
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,409
interests us

214
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,629
for pros  and cons of the numbering

215
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,550
for silva - so that we have a

216
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,229
lot of results in a very

217
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:22,630
fast way because it is also

218
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,090
such a very very partner  very fast it is also slower

219
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,620
generally suspend I think it is the

220
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,800
fastest and we can have it depends on the

221
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,300
target we shoot if we are

222
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,099
against the key for example to say

223
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,049
something not very big we will have thousands

224
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,610
of their domains in a matter of seconds

225
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,760
and  Above all, for me the most

226
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,099
important part of passive numbering is

227
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,450
that all the information that we connect

228
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,510
will be useful for the rest

229
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,160
of the numbering phases of your domains, it

230
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,290
is like let's say we are going to have

231
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,690
a first image there  of everything we

232
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,960
have and the cons of the best passive action,

233
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,420
if only if we only use this, it

234
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,830
is that in many cases the information

235
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,590
is obsolete, not only is it not, you

236
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,630
just have to throw a software from one more

237
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,390
to the tool to the web world

238
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,150
dotcom web and they are going to return

239
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,570
like 4000 results and well,

240
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,280
logically it makes no sense, a web right

241
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,390
now has four or five

242
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,540
active domains, so in

243
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,610
many cases the information  They

244
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,990
are adding it instead of

245
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,400
updating it and removing those that no longer

246
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,320
exist, so the information they give us,

247
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,660
well, it is not the best in the

248
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,450
universe and then to have good

249
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,950
information we have to be

250
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,840
attacking our services, which

251
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,000
is not  a very big counter but if

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,800
you want

253
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,020
to sign up for the 60 hamas services then you can easily throw yourself at

254
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,700
noon for a whole day but

255
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,040
realizing then you have to configure

256
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,350
process all those tools

257
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,800
if we are using, for example, censuses

258
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,320
and security trade to give us many

259
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,510
results  similar if not 90

260
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,870
percent then in the end this

261
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,240
we are depending on

262
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,250
third party services with which

263
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,150
all this is already commercialized

264
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,830
are payment services you will not be able to

265
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,450
have all the information that you

266
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,580
would like for free because sometimes from

267
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,780
free of charge and that and that the last

268
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,790
budget at the end involves the pp a

269
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,040
series of spending of tokens or requests

270
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,980
that if you are actively using this,

271
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,930
you will get defensive emails

272
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,480
saying that you are charged for 90% of

273
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,330
the quota in a day it happens to me

274
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,570
then well, all this is interesting but

275
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,640
it will only serve as a basis for

276
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,250
now to continue then  We are going to continue

277
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,890
with the next method, which is the

278
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,530
subdomain numbering through

279
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,600
certificate transparency, this is

280
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,310
still a passive technique but I think

281
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,770
it was worth

282
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,850
telling you a little more in detail because it

283
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,190
is a

284
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,190
curious one

285
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,980
in certificate transparency  etc

286
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,720
for the acronym in English is

287
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,550
a service that was created so that the

288
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,860
certifying entities issue the

289
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,959
certificates for the websites with ss

290
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,829
ss l can

291
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:18,589
confirm or can verify that these

292
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:19,569
certificates

293
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,939
are valid in order to detect possible

294
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:25,610
fraud then we instead of

295
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,559
look to see if the certificate on

296
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,269
page x is valid, correct or not

297
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,230
fraudulent, what we are going to do is

298
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,709
recover the report  ation of all the

299
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,300
certificates that belong to x

300
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,559
domain then we will also have

301
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,649
very fast information and

302
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:47,449
in many cases more reliable or more up-to-

303
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:49,579
date than if we use the

304
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:52,249
services of third parties like more than one

305
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:53,839
sultan of all this

306
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,779
I have left here to the  two websites

307
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,120
that you can check the transparency

308
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,279
of certificates in case it is obvious web I

309
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,990
have left you there in three tools I

310
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,639
usually used this one from ctf

311
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,490
because it is the one that gives me a cleaner output

312
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,529
so I can use it

313
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,030
later to continue working

314
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,970
and  Well then,

315
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,329
as pros cons compared to the previous one,

316
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,610
this is free and is more up-to-date

317
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,040
because when a new certificate is generated,

318
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,019
the certifying entities

319
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:24,610
are obliged to

320
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,439
report that certificate, so

321
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:29,350
we will have information on all the

322
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,290
subdomains that are being created.

323
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,370
Well, in a fairly quickly

324
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,449
updated way, what happens is that you will only

325
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,310
have information from the websites

326
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,839
that  have certificates if there are

327
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,370
subdomains that are not serving the

328
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,050
websites that are not serving websites

329
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,800
with ssl because this technique is not going

330
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,889
to return information

331
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:51,959
with this we would leave the passive numbering part a bit

332
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,359
and now we go to

333
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,249
the active numbering part  which is the

334
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:58,889
one that I like the most that it would be

335
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:02,160
because it is the force of a [ __ ]

336
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,230
because it is the concept of enumerating your

337
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,029
domains by means of brute force because it

338
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:09,540
is to take a dictionary and make a multitude

339
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,080
of requests for ms

340
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,820
concatenating each word in the

341
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,290
dictionary  for the domain that

342
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,710
we want to attack him,

343
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,050
this is light, it is a bit like a

344
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,460
summary of everything that I am going to tell

345
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,070
now, so these two tools

346
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,620
are the best known, then I am going to

347
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,330
point out

348
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,610
because I prefer mash of that respect to

349
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,440
the dns season,

350
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,760
but hey  Likewise, about the two

351
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,090
tools that are used the most and I leave you

352
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,920
a couple of dictionaries to make an

353
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,090
out, this seems to me that it has if I'm

354
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,860
not mistaken I don't know it's six m  illones eleven

355
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,980
million lines and this one from that country

356
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,690
mixes

357
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,760
well it has completed the dictionaries that

358
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,870
had several various tools

359
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,510
so it is smaller it seems that it

360
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,610
has a hundred thousand lines but they

361
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,160
are original results that it is

362
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,939
quite well done

363
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,530
and the results that we get from

364
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,970
brute force  That we have not

365
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,010
previously obtained with the passion for the

366
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,050
transparency of certificates have the

367
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,330
advantage that they are very

368
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,410
valuable results because they are not indexed,

369
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,230
let's say that only people

370
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,940
who are doing brute force have them,

371
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,310
then we are already seeing a little step

372
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,379
ahead of people  that only throws its

373
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,600
flag and whatever it is there is

374
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,389
not much there is still much to

375
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:33,839
remove the problem of brute force that

376
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,269
if we are launching it from home

377
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:39,149
this cannot limit our

378
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,769
own much and it is the worst our own

379
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:42,120
router  it can make us a

380
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,209
tense bottleneck.Our router can

381
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:47,279
collapse because a lot of

382
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,439
people have been hit by a lot of people.  to then the

383
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,120
adult force I recommend always launching it

384
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,670
from a vps that will be as best not

385
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,740
to work and also we avoid

386
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,620
bans because the servers of the

387
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,870
resolution of ns in many things in

388
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,939
many cases if they receive too many

389
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:05,129
requests from the same ip you  They go and

390
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:07,139
they start to give you false positives and pnv

391
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,029
to be negative with which the tests

392
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,439
are already invalidated and it is

393
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:12,149
useless to continue

394
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,430
doing brute force, this is worth as an

395
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,589
overview of brute force we are going

396
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:20,689
to explain a little more  in detail

397
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,100
how it works in the resolution of two

398
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,649
children by dns

399
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:29,559
what we do is this is a bit by way

400
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,059
of introduction in case someone does not know

401
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:32,860
how the product works, ok I have

402
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,720
left you here a screenshot that

403
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,459
explained very well the number of

404
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:37,839
positions that  gives appointment but basically it

405
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,290
is your questions to a dns server

406
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,470
for a site that dns server queries

407
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,379
the site if the request exists returns to

408
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,910
the dns server and the server  r dns

409
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,129
answers you then what does this mean

410
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:52,959
we are not launching requests

411
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,029
directly to our workshop below

412
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:55,959
our objective

413
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,490
we are always asking another server

414
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,259
to act between means to make all

415
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,089
the requests for then

416
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,410
what happens that they do not forget to have

417
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,360
typical that  we all know that we

418
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,920
may like them more or less they have

419
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,800
limitations

420
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,010
google has it documented it has a

421
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,140
maximum limit of 1,500 requests per

422
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,970
second if it mans and they launched more

423
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,610
we go back to the old false positives

424
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,130
and false negatives

425
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,010
cloud according to the documentation according to them they

426
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,579
have a limit  dynamic that we do not know

427
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,680
what it means but based on

428
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,660
testing the I had the conclusion that it

429
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,579
is around 300 measurements per

430
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,829
second if you go beyond that they will

431
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,079
either start to block or give

432
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,440
wrong results well then online

433
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,190
directly  will be asked and I

434
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,959
have asked him during the week because

435
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,660
reporting on this and well after he

436
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,110
has  After going through 700 departments, they

437
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,920
reached conclusions that

438
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,470
allowed us to brute force dns that

439
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,269
if it detected that there were many requests

440
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,670
from the same IP in which they were going to

441
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,819
block opendns, it also does not allow brute force,

442
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,640
comfortable, they do not give any

443
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,230
information about this or respond to anything

444
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,770
and  alternate dns and the same is like cloud

445
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,510
being they say it is dynamic but

446
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,099
doing two different tests

447
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,990
of launching more than 100 requests per

448
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,849
second the block results begin to empty

449
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:24,079


450
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,240
and then how are we going to do if

451
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,940
we want to solve a list of six

452
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,309
million subdomains because  If

453
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,470
we have that wall has 1,500

454
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,110
positions per second there will be 100 ounces

455
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,389
the account but surely it is days or

456
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:41,669
weeks I do not know but a long time in it

457
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:44,169
will compensate

458
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:46,779
for this we are going to introduce the concept

459
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:49,059
of solving that it is nothing more than the

460
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:51,100
servers that  They are going to resolve requests

461
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,359
from Mexico

462
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,279
to see what we are going to do, it is going to be to

463
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,480
use a tool called

464
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,419
Tennessee Valley.  So what

465
00:17:58,419 --> 00:17:59,679
this tool does is that we give it

466
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,340
a list of public months and

467
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,999
it will tell us if those months do not give us an

468
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,869
answer to our IP, we only

469
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:13,779
have a list of dns and this

470
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:14,859
tool begins to make requests

471
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,379
because for  Example resolve resolve in

472
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:19,539
google and all those who respond because

473
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,190
we are by fact that they are

474
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,230
dns servers is valid for our ip

475
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,539
for our region this because it is

476
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,169
because there is a series of

477
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:31,869
public dns servers of companies or governments

478
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:36,389
or infrastructure power  Public

479
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:39,299
here for example one of the views comes out

480
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,789
there are a couple more of them if you want

481
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,159
then I can go through Chad or

482
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,259
wonder what

483
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,659
the case is, what happens if within

484
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:51,009
this list of public benefits

485
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:53,200
there are months that are hosted  In

486
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,509
China, the problem is that

487
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,309
maybe if we try to make requests from time

488
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:58,960
to time it is that it will win, we will

489
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,119
not respond to it, so that does not

490
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,769
mean pressure.  ar are negative steps in

491
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:05,109
our tests or for example if

492
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:08,649
we are in Russia because there may be

493
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,029
many servers that directly

494
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,739
have a place all the requests that

495
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:14,139
arrive from the United States then with

496
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:15,279
that variety and all we are going to

497
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,889
achieve is to generate a list of

498
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,409
custom dns servers for

499
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,330
our ip of our location and at

500
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,080
this exact moment by then what we

501
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,200
do is get the list of

502
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,389
dns resolvers or discoverers that

503
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:33,249
work for us for this they

504
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:35,620
leave the cell itself barbeito

505
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,750
normally this is returning on

506
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,580
average  A list of better than 800 at

507
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,289
least here in Spain is

508
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,870
returning the list to me 800 800 dns servers

509
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,440


510
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,590
what we do is launch the resolution

511
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,389
of ns against all these instead of

512
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,009
launching a request only to google and that

513
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,080
they respond and wait  And so what we

514
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,509
do is that if we have 800

515
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:59,610
dns servers we can launch 20 requests,

516
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,980
complying with our results at this time

517
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,720
s they are going to expand

518
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,370
much more

519
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,030
this this speed that tripoli takes

520
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,700
per second is the speed that I am

521
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,290
reaching at home from my

522
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:19,750
home router without blocking it and without trying and

523
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,840
without problems with my esp since

524
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,510
1 vps I have come to have  two

525
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,720
miccoli per second that is a

526
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,390
low intensity method

527
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,550
what happens that those insane

528
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,300
public servers that exist and there are times that they

529
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,550
are not as good or as reliable as

530
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,260
the cloud flight can be believe then

531
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,780
what we are going to do is going to be  make

532
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,490
requests against our list of

533
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,680
public DNS servers and with the

534
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,150
results that we have, we will

535
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,080
confirm it will put us the list of DNS is

536
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,270
from large companies such as google if from

537
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,220
a list of 100,000 of 100,000

538
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,280
subdomains these will be held in

539
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,050
public in large return 5,000 valid

540
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,060
for with only these 5,000 I will

541
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,610
appropriate confirm with google and in that

542
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,830
case I will make a list of those

543
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,380
domains that is quite reliable and well they

544
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,850
are confirmed with  tra google,

545
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,620
which is why it

546
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,810
is a fairly consistent list, the

547
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,720
problem that I mentioned before

548
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,460
if we do not double the

549
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,830
servers and trust only the

550
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,130
public dns servers and we will

551
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,650
have many false positives because

552
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,140
we do not know what conditions that list

553
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,510
of  800 servers in that audience we

554
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,120
do not know in which we launch 50 requests they are

555
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,460
going to tell us to start

556
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,430
returning all positive to this guy because

557
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,980
I think he is attacking me

558
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,330
then so twice the gum is very

559
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,250
important and this is what he does not do is

560
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,180
do tns with respect to dns puree recently they

561
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,040
introduced the possibility of

562
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,010
checking it against servers

563
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,240
against servers, let's say

564
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,320
trustworthy such as

565
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,090
cluster flights, what happens

566
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,770
in problems that are using club

567
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,540
flare and jarkko was getting it in

568
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,510
pairs then cloud as we saw  Before it

569
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,080
has a limit of 300 and that is the best thing to do, it

570
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,870
directly shoots the web instead of

571
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,480
using production is that the prob

572
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,650
Suárez club motto that it was a problem in

573
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,060
which you go overboard starts with false

574
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,590
positives and false negatives and is that

575
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,939
all the work for almost a century

576
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,180
I think this is a bit in transit to

577
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,280
understand this first but well if

578
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,560
there are doubts or what  So you ask me

579
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,980
he had supposed a screenshot of how

580
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,650
puree works heres to whom I am

581
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,660
saying that he is going to force me gross against

582
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,610
a list of subdomains that I have, I

583
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,110
hope it is the one that I have least commented

584
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,660
before that had a hundred thousand lines against

585
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,780
the domain  that I want and the

586
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,040
friendship of resolving has been previously generated to me

587
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,380
where in that it goes direct by

588
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,900
then what it does is to resolve the

589
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,150
domains against the resolvers, the

590
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,920
product remains that the

591
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,650
public resolvers are one hundred thousand lines and they

592
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,900
were taking a thousand ways out of me.  per second

593
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,360
to then eliminate the 'wild cards' and

594
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,820
then make another pass it does the

595
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,190
doublet against the

596
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,400
trusted resolvers that can be google blogs

597
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,800
is going to a limit  mite of 284 which per

598
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,630
second with which google never

599
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,860
beats us to vania and we finally have

600
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,470
a list of seven valid domains

601
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,730
through force

602
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,270
bye

603
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,970
said this we are going to pass with a part

604
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,560
of the brute force that are the

605
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,740
permutations and alterations  which is

606
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,160
a technique that serves to give better

607
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,010
views and we can have a list of

608
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,570
subdomains a dictionary of their

609
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,810
domains that may be interesting in

610
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,070
that way unit but the permutations

611
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,639
and alterations

612
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,250
let's say that it is a way of working

613
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,170
on the information that we have for  That

614
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,900
comes in handy with the information of the

615
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,670
passive technique because there we are going to get

616
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,980
a lot of information and now we are going to

617
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,330
work with them when they are interested in

618
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,370
all that information for how it is put

619
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,470
there because that the permutations and

620
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,360
alterations serve to generalize is to get

621
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,710
off in  The autonomies that

622
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,870
we already have and that we have to pass a visit

623
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,110


624
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,630
I am explaining to you and now I

625
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,590
feel a little in all the  s

626
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,570
instructions likes

627
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,940
that we want from the permutations

628
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,620
we want that if we have a subdomain

629
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,280
that is as I have put here you will come

630
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,530
2021 I want a list of permutation

631
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,920
in the middle to sell again 2022 sale 2019

632
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,430
2030 2050 I want interest on that -

633
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,990
up and down

634
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,570
I also want that instead of sales of a

635
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,330
21 message because for example it pointed to

636
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,670
increases to 2021 that also interest

637
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,380
about the depth levels of

638
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,010
subdomains and I also want you to use

639
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,800
both the points to lower the level

640
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,110
above the level as seen and also you

641
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,520
put scripts because it is a new

642
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,220
special character that allows the

643
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,800
domains

644
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,670
and then souls then what I want

645
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,640
this is at this point I find it very

646
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,350
interesting because only this

647
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,570
tool does it I want the domains you

648
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,150
have before to take the words and

649
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,950
start to  work with them in such a

650
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,260
way that we

651
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,120
achieve that if we are working

652
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,700
with a target that later, for example,

653
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,160
I have no idea  of your ego or

654
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,350
Polish or whatever language it is, start

655
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,240
working on the words that I have already

656
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,220
recovered from passive migration

657
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,380
then I don't care not knowing I

658
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,540
don't care it is not so important to ignore

659
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,280
that language because I will already be working

660
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,020
on those words and  If, for example,

661
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,650
we have api development on the ground, we

662
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,990
all want

663
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,760
development and ground to take me and start

664
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,500
working with them with other subdomains

665
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,140
up and down, then

666
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,090
we are going to start removing their domains,

667
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,400
we are going to start removing dictionaries from

668
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,370
Very specific subdomains for the

669
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,170
target, so we are working on

670
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:20,950
which is quite interesting information,

671
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,929
pros and cons of this, because in the end it is the

672
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,210
same as brute force with an addition

673
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,799
in the cons in the results that are

674
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,809
accommodated that would be very valuable.

675
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:29,919
results that we find that

676
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,149
we find here that are not in

677
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:32,710
passive lamination logically everything

678
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,260
that we get from here

679
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,210
is already a bit far-fetched to find  rar

680
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,769
for most people and then

681
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,340
also

682
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,740
the added disadvantage regarding brute force

683
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,510
without more is the disk space

684
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,580
generated by these dictionaries takes a lot and

685
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,309
I generate 50 gb dictionaries and by

686
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,710
consenting to feel solving for

687
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,390
15 hours

688
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,620
good but it is  The information that

689
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,480
we know is useful,

690
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,820
of course, here the top tool

691
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,220
for me, calmly made a friend and

692
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,470
we were talking about what would be the ideal

693
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,890
and he took it out of the water, it is beautiful, it seems

694
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,870
to me that it is the best stop for this

695
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,410
technique and well here  Two very

696
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,840
simple examples sarabia I screen this

697
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,820
stress of the exhausting tool but

698
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,080
well if I have if I have the subdomain of

699
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,840
the passive cancellation sales 2021 because

700
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,970
I want you to start getting me this type

701
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,500
of information that I know you have

702
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,720
words ahead with a script that

703
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,419
apart  of concatenating and television about groups

704
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,640
that what interest both the people behind

705
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,429
and ahead and then also if I have

706
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:40,669
sales in 2021 and I have marketing I want them

707
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:42,230
to me  zcles I also want you to catch

708
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,080
sales marketing and change it interest

709
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,330
in the numbers mix by the

710
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,179
words in front of the words behind this

711
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:52,370
type of approach that we look for

712
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,840
when doing this technique

713
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,670
here I have put you I think they exist

714
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,900
assured good I explain it

715
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,670
I have put these  3 subdomains of

716
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,040
course these 300 children well no I

717
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,600
am not going to play it but that there is not the

718
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,450
same simple web marketing

719
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,950
bentonville advantage but one marketing you

720
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,720
buy this from their domains and then

721
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,420
here a list of four permutations

722
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,310
simply and now seen permutations

723
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,230
that I use have like a thousand  and peak is

724
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,480
public and the truth is that another could

725
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,250
have put it here and now this has taken

726
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,560
advantage of it

727
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,390
then with this view of subdomains

728
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,760
that are only three and this list of four

729
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,710
permutations

730
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,900
gotor we launched it and we get a list

731
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,870
of 318 words

732
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,550
to me  It seems that it is difficult to

733
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,620
guess how much when I could get but

734
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,150
the truth is that it seems a bit

735
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,290
old to me

736
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,110
this screenshot is the  beginning of

737
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,040
what begins

738
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,790
then well logically this takes you out

739
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,550
of taking out the main child work here

740
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,440
I put you we started working and it begins

741
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,230
to put in point and the script this is what

742
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,120
we talked about intel astros of the

743
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,710
levels of the subdomains with the

744
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,440
words that  I have and it begins to mix

745
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,640
because that with a point with a hyphen is followed by it

746
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,630
begins to integrate on the knots

747
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,760
also this I already tell you is the output

748
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,999
that this coma generates

749
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:15,069
a little more advanced we see that it

750
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:16,199
begins to mix

751
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:18,609
marketing and sales but also they changed

752
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:20,999
numbers it

753
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,870
begins to  mixing it is an anti program

754
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,880
by entries with dashed points and

755
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,799
around here we already see that in the end it

756
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,600
is logically a process because at the

757
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,799
beginning it makes the parts

758
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,480
simpler and at the end more in return and the

759
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,059
more complicated domains this remember

760
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:35,320
that it is only a  dictionary then you have to

761
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,320
solve it with orders for my taste

762
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,480
good because that in the end already starts to

763
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,230
mix because that of boa and with words

764
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,820
that we have already passed empi  Start here to

765
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,270
mix everything in a very, very way

766
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,330
and well this would already be the part of the

767
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,760
questions this as I said one

768
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,230
we have this dictionary we save it in

769
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,090
a txt and then we simply have to

770
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,890
do it for its khaki check in that one

771
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,390
that says  that is so useful and that you are going to

772
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,190
use the kaka list before general

773
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,290
permutations tells you in the list of

774
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,550
results that you have

775
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,530
previously generated with tennessee valley dator

776
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,720
and where

777
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,679
the following technique to extract domains

778
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,590
from ms records seems

779
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,430
silly but

780
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,500
If it was, if everything was well done,

781
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,440
if the world were ideal, the servers and

782
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,840
the ns registers would be used to

783
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,420
use it, but I found myself many

784
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,840
times that, for example, an mx register

785
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,970
is the one used for the

786
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,070
mail service that the domain is pointing to.  It

787
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,540
turns out that it is also serving a

788
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,000
website and is serving a database

789
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,280
for that town, so we do not lose

790
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,020
anything by getting this type of information.

791
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,420
Well, we can find

792
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,610
from a domain that we have not taken from

793
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,340
other forms of making the web because I

794
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,650
use the sx for this tool, which

795
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,630
is simply to tell it how many stained glass windows to

796
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,520
tell it what type of records you want to

797
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,150
take and that's it and balance and there the info does not come out

798
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,880
or  little has been left here with

799
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,800
reference to which are each of

800
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,190
the records the nsn records are

801
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,710
worth the following technique would be to

802
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,750
crawling on the websites of the

803
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,830
subdomains as it removes

804
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,820
what we do with this technique is that

805
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,000
we launch a crawler to a spider and

806
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,370
we analyze

807
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,050
the responses that it is returning us

808
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,630
in search of more subdomains because

809
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,150
many times in our preference 2

810
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,130
anywhere else and it turns out that it was not

811
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,750
written is calling a subdomain

812
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,210
of the development api from I do not know where and

813
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,920
we have not found any way nothing

814
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,010
else  So then, the first thing you do not

815
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,420
click at the beginning of all the

816
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,160
domains that we have, the first thing is to see

817
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,620
which ones are serving websites because

818
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,450
not all domains are websites so

819
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,430
for that use the http tool x

820
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,490
which is the simplest

821
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,420
as for crawler I use spider

822
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,130
there is also -ha crawler that has passed

823
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,490
a version 2 recently but

824
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,890
I personally like it better or spider and it

825
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:14,320
returns  many more results then

826
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,809
or spider as I was saying here has been

827
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,090
an example of how it is executed and it is

828
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,889
removing all the subnets that are

829
00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:23,679
finding all the references and

830
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,200
then on this we would have to filter to

831
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,789
stay only with the subdomains

832
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:29,799
so for that we use the

833
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:33,059
tool a full  which is simply

834
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:36,159
tells him is that our position the example

835
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,230
you tell him what he wants from a

836
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,090
list of duties and he returns it to

837
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,730
you here I have given you an example to

838
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,270
add a little because with spider it returns us

839
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,919


840
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,960
then because you have to remove all this

841
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,240
first  part so that it is not easy and

842
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,760
we are left alone in http https ok

843
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,150
then cleaning the urls and

844
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,500
we only tell you to remove the

845
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,309
d  omingos and here is in fact just

846
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:08,279
what they like as an example because there

847
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,270
was a time when test php point

848
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,240
web.com that I suppose you will all know

849
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,070
and it is not yet condensed in

850
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,510
the passive search engines and if you

851
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,590
logically wanted if you take any  web is

852
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,270
there the link but it is that it was only there

853
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,669
then I working with the

854
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:32,070
tool of knowledge of that cases

855
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,929
domains that said how can it be that

856
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,450
you are hp punto bulwer dotcom

857
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,760
no do not get it suspended or

858
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,620
whatever and it turns out that it is  that it was not

859
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,840
indicated and could only be taken out already

860
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,750
made in world war dotcom and you brought them

861
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,179
from there logically speaking

862
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,999
recognized in recognition people

863
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:54,240
let's tell them without looking good because

864
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,279
this would be claudio's part to

865
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:59,320
get a mix seat

866
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,950
again another technique  interesting google

867
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,910
analytics for those who know

868
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,040
google analytics is a

869
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,730
google service that you use to measure

870
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,119
because visits to your website

871
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,460
give you information  How many visits

872
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,268
you have for works by kepa and espanto has

873
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:25,190
a powerful device because all

874
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,319
that kind of information that is useful for

875
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:29,418
a website administrator is going

876
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:31,759
to be used to extract and relate more

877
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:34,990
domains and more utopias

878
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,989
and that when you give yourself  high in google

879
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,530
analytics you create an idea of which

880
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,060
analytics

881
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,969
per user what happens if you are the

882
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,300
owner of the hacker one I do not know who is the

883
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,339
owner or administrator of

884
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,349
hacker domains but if you are that man

885
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:54,300
that lady are

886
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,030
going to have  your analytics fluency and

887
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,550
each domain without a domain that you register is

888
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,740
going to have to take that idea

889
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,530
critics you can create another account but

890
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,010
usually the usual thing is that you want to

891
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,450
have all the information in a single

892
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,280
panel in the same dashboard have

893
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,530
all your websites there  After your visit

894
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,020
then what you do is use the

895
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,540
same benitez for all your sites and

896
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,410
with this technique

897
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,970
curious things are also removed because it also

898
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,230
gives you domains and n  Or are the subdomains

899
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,060
when you are working with a target

900
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,599
such as tesla or any other

901
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,700
that you have combo open to everything that

902
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,670
is yours, I do not know if ibm or not, this is

903
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,559
it, because suddenly you see what

904
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:42,529
controls me, you control analytics of others

905
00:35:42,529 --> 00:35:43,759
domains that had not even been

906
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:45,799
proposed to you and usually it turns out that it is

907
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:48,690
because they own them

908
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,230
and we continue that air of ang and tics, you

909
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,700
have to insert the javascript that

910
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,130
that page has and there are a couple of

911
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,810
services that will give us that information

912
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,569
that they give us  There is a relationship that exists in

913
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:03,540
one sven width and another is that target and

914
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,780
then there is a tool that is in the

915
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,000
same friend before what José 87 told you

916
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,660
that what it does is basically

917
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,060
by finishing consulting these two

918
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,730
well in fact remove the ities from the

919
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,710
page that is and consult these two

920
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,079
to give us the results this

921
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,810
code fragment that I have put here

922
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,119
is from the google documentation and it is

923
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,130
how the analytics video should be included

924
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,049
on your web page

925
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:35,199
well because it is here that your post in the

926
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,660
examples of how each one of

927
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,349
them works in bilwi if you consult any

928
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:44,410
one.com it tells you that the idea of skin that

929
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,719
the hacker one is using is this and

930
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,579
it tells you here  Well, what they have

931
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,319
is any balance for harper one

932
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:52,949
hackers in top dotcom

933
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:56,410
24con.com, because what we know and what we

934
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,809
expect but hey and we see this

935
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:00,849
relationship here and maybe there is some

936
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:02,439
domain that we did not expect to

937
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,869
be in the same from the

938
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,900
hacker target

939
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,869
directly is for the app and you wear

940
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:12,119
the analysis leader here and I will

941
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,010
return the results but this

942
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,660
tool has commented that it is

943
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,210
elementary

944
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,820
that you tell it directly the web you

945
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,130
want to consult and it starts to do its

946
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,580
work.  That one to

947
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,330
consult one thousand and one bilwi capital and it returns

948
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,520
the same

949
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,810
as always the strong tool in me

950
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,870
not because I have a defendant, the good one,

951
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,820
since the few powders in the

952
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,710
condomina in the panel  It is quite

953
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,390
useful,

954
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,910
okay and finally, we are going to talk

955
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,680
about

956
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,650
let's say the manual or simple way that it

957
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,720
would be from burt is we

958
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,330
are working we are analyzing the

959
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,490
target that is we are going to work with it

960
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,850
for everyone simply at the moment

961
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,590
we have  navigated through the site and

962
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,150
we want to extract a list of their

963
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,950
domains because to automate the attack

964
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,740
for whatever reason is nothing

965
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,770
more than in the tab of also you in

966
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,840
case you

967
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,800
select all the states 10 votes

968
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,410
right copy the urls and save it

969
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,600
In a file the text such as

970
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,970
this is what I have done and then with

971
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,800
the tool presented before we

972
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,380
passed it to it and it would return

973
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,230
the domains to us and then also apart from

974
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,210
there is an extension that doing

975
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,970
this I discovered it I said by looking at it is quite

976
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,130
interesting is the same we select

977
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,530
all together an extractor copy their

978
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,330
domains and we have it ready all

979
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,850
clean

980
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,580
and good because these are a little all the

981
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,430
t  techniques that I applied in my day to day

982
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,080
when I have to make an

983
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,510
external bridge or when it begins to organize it

984
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,090
target

985
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,000
of camping

986
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,100
and on God I wanted to take a

987
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,080
screenshot of the week record here, which is the

988
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,810
tool that I like to maintain and

989
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,990
I took a thousand  hours of sleep and life

990
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,060
this is the gel so that you know

991
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,250
anyway it was a lot of possibilities and

992
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,260
that I am not going to make many flowers either

993
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,510
but I like them it works well and this

994
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,190
is the side this is afloat

995
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,990
when it is  it puts

996
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,760
the passive numbering to

997
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,070
transparency of certificates to take out its Sunday by then what

998
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,560
it does is after removing the passive

999
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,910
of transparency of scientific 2 it

1000
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,880
consults with pure ns which of them

1001
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,940
are active then from here up to 81

1002
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,920
unique while police identified

1003
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,550
63 that  here it was not and of all this

1004
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,000
finally there are 36 neighborhoods 36 active that

1005
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
respond to requests for nexus well

1006
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,020
then only by brute force

1007
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,770
questions was here in force

1008
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,560
gross za this was a national also

1009
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,570
normal with the list of 100,000 out of

1010
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,060
100,000 subdomains and it took me 42

1011
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,680
seconds

1012
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,330
obviously having generated in the list

1013
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,040
of the public resolutory all this that

1014
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,020
has been told before and then the list of

1015
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,750
permutations is that what gives what

1016
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,260
I do is remove the list of subdomains

1017
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,030
integrate with the list of

1018
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,430
questions now if there is a list of x's

1019
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,520
of many the results several gigabytes

1020
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,710
because it has not taken 15 minutes

1021
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,080
then surely there would be millions of

1022
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,570
results and well then here you

1023
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,690
have what I do  It is when I have

1024
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,250
a list of subdomains already

1025
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,740
filtering enough I start to do about

1026
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,710
it recursively if I have

1027
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,800
dotcom hardware like let point know goal.com

1028
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,720
and I start working only on that as

1029
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,820
if it were a single domain and from

1030
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,370
there it starts working  from here begins

1031
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:45,600
recursive facebook

1032
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,969
well I have put here a reference of

1033
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:49,200
all the tools that I have mentioned

1034
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,799
in case you want to take a look  and that's

1035
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:54,749
it, we've finished the talk,

1036
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:56,700
thank you very much and I hope you haven't been too bored

1037
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,149
