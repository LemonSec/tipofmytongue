1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,389
Now everyone is welcome to my

2
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:10,940
talk, which is to demonstrate and increase the

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,389
impact of a skill.

4
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:17,119
I am going to start by introducing my name is

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,970
running but you might know me

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,189
about the name of liu ping and

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,519
I am an ethical hacker and a whole security

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,400
for human man who is a European leader

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,290
not of DIY home and gardening and is

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,620
a peix brand I am also a brand manager in

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,110
charge of the web program 'www

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,110
inti hand hands on hardware and

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,539
medicine also as someone curious

14
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,260
and who likes to do berwyn  from his work

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,020
cavani always tried to learn

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,500
new things

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,020
that exactly my job is like

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,450
trying to hack hand by hand to

19
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,260
find security flaws and help

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,730
the teams

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,040
to have a better security of

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,409
our platform

23
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,499
and our values in the

24
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:14,319
security team is always to put  the human in

25
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,530
front of everything must be told to try

26
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,109
to have a clear communication with the

27
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:23,319
teams and to help them have the

28
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,200
best possible security  ible on the side as a

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,380
coach but also with doing soria

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,700
nehring and things like that it's super good

31
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,380
we always have the

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,770
offensive mentality to say that when we are going to

33
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,420
work on a project we

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,020
will always try to grasp the

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,030
point of view of an attacker and know

36
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,360
How are we going to be able to break things and

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,429
also try to have a

38
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:55,350
very strong cybersecurity and hacker culture

39
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,060
internally with our teams but

40
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,869
also externally when with

41
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,450
ethical hackers for example about our

42
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,399
bwin program you have a

43
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,449
very strong sense of community

44
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,090
that we are going  To start with defining

45
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,340
what a vulnerability is, for me a

46
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,519
vulnerability is a

47
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,030
control or design implementation flaw

48
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,040
that will try to break the

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,830
security policies or the

50
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,250
vulnerable system and that in the end will imply

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,560
as the possibility for a

52
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,680
hacking attacker and hacking the system that is

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,340
vulnerable and how security

54
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,590
impacts that for me  They are

55
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,680
like the consequences that you can

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,390
exactly do with the vulnerability

57
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,920
and what you have to know is that

58
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,630
depending on the company

59
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,530
you have to adapt to the vulnerability to

60
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,769
have different impacts because not

61
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,540
all companies have the same

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,420
products and do not do all the same thing

63
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,310
that aznar we are going to have to use

64
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,769
creativity to adapt to

65
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,799
the company's products and have the

66
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,450
best possible impact,

67
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,209
for example we are going to degrade the cases

68
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,489
of ecommerce where the interesting impacts are

69
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,459
going to be like all the

70
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:23,959
confidential information links such

71
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,400
as girls and  obviously financial scams

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,220
because if you can change the

73
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,709
prices of all the products they are going to

74
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,260
buy it will be very problematic

75
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,030
also for everything that is corporate espionage

76
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,129


77
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,870
to say trying to find

78
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,569
confidential information about the

79
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:50,370
company but as a gram of

80
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,840
the crypt world  we are going to have as

81
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,659
interesting impacts as super different for

82
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,390
example if it can  You want to do one with you

83
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,760
because you decide to steal the wallet of other

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,340
people to exploit the money, yes,

85
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,260
as well as stealing from the smart

86
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,900
contracts, it will be a very

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,400
interesting impact rather than failures to clean

88
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,709
everything that you estimate from the services.

89
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,589
you can stop the

90
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,190
exchanges and the transactions that they are

91
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,870
going to have on the block change can

92
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,080
be very problematic

93
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,199
also a little bad politically it is the

94
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,310
attack of 59% it must be said that it is a

95
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,439
theory

96
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,020
where if someone has 51 percent of

97
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,530
a currency then it goes  To be able to influence

98
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,169
on that currency

99
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:47,659
to make a little more generalist the one of

100
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,930
not opening of this specific theory

101
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,610
we can say that the

102
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,770
interesting impact will be to be able to

103
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,000
influence on the brush

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,520
and to finish the

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,100
interesting impacts for all cloud

106
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,220
providers such as insurers bs  It will

107
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,950
also be a conte cover but this time it is

108
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,330
from the administrators of the

109
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,030
hard machines that is from nayef services of the

110
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,310
imagined machines  ate yes, for example,

111
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,810
for all abs machines we are going

112
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,570
to have a huge impact on

113
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,930
all customers and also everything that is the

114
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,419
rate of exclusion on the machines of

115
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,600
the clients of those companies and just

116
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,480
to say a word about that today in

117
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,280
day there is like a vulnerability on the

118
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,780
south that is called oh my god and that as the

119
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,810
south puts an agent inside the

120
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,350
virtual machines that are on linux and

121
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,680
those people will put as a staunch

122
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,290
exclusion but with authentication the

123
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,440
problem is that they cannot

124
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,010
when the authorization hater does not pass

125
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,650
you will be able to do without authentication and

126
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,920
you will be able to execute rhythms

127
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,890
fusion codes that today are a

128
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,950
very critical false security and that if I

129
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,470
remember correctly there is no patch at the moment

130
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,500
that makes me laugh a lot

131
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,230
and to  there will be a little more blue they

132
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,940
have a lot of different products and

133
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,520
that is interesting because each product

134
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,730
will be exchanged with other products

135
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,910
for example if you have a web app you will

136
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,840
be able to  r put a write server behind and

137
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,970
then you will be able to reuse the south

138
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,300
craft to do all the analysis and

139
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,540
finally it will be important to

140
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,420
know how all the products

141
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,180
communicate with each other because you will be able

142
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,940
to move from one product to another to

143
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,249
have  more impact

144
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:03,009
to a question than

145
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:06,079
much to that ethical one of our

146
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,259
bounty program asks me is how do

147
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:11,989
we evaluate the human impact of a

148
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,119
vulnerability?

149
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:16,189


150
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:19,129


151
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:22,909


152
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,349
We are going to calculate the cbc score and then

153
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:30,709
we are going to evaluate the technical impact only

154
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,219
on a very small perimeter, for

155
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:36,829
example only on the functionality

156
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,369
that is vulnerable and then we will

157
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,679
try to find the code or

158
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,829
logic that is broken,

159
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:47,329
then we will pass as  to the part a

160
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:49,939
little more analysis where we will try

161
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,459
to find proof of exploits

162
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:56,179
and malicious actors have exported the

163
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:59,659
vulnerability  The impact is going to be much

164
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,869
bigger for us and then we are going

165
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:05,880
to try

166
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,000
to know since when there is a

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,540
security risk and more and more time was there more

168
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,490
impact is going to be great for us

169
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,949
and after that we are going to contact the

170
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:21,389
teams  and we are going to ask how to

171
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:24,039
explain the perimeter of any

172
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,780
weakness to know, for example, if the

173
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,800
code that is affected is going to be

174
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,380
able to do other functionalities as rotations on

175
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,130
other parts and in the end

176
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,260
we are going to try to find escalations

177
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,860
of the vulnerability with the equipment and

178
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,440
We are also going to ask

179
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,870
if it is difficult to fix for Christmas' or

180
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,149
not more difficult, the more impact

181
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:51,760
vulnerability has for us and in the end

182
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,589
we are going to try to

183
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:55,690
relate all that means that we are

184
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,370
going to gain the technical impact that

185
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,770
we already talked about before but we are also going to  to

186
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,899
try to look at the impacts on the

187
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,790
clients

188
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,710
and then also the impact on the

189
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,200
teams.

190
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,510
or Christmas is

191
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,850
not going to be shocking for

192
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,310
us and also everything that is

193
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,740
business impact and for example we lost

194
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,380
money with this vulnerability or not

195
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,260
that is how we are going to evaluate

196
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,650
impact by hand and it is super

197
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,450
interesting for us to do that

198
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,640
because  When we are going to find a

199
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,890
vulnerability we are going to be able to talk to

200
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,760
the teams about what it does and give it the

201
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,130
point of view of an attacker and our

202
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,970
teams are very interested in how a

203
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,360
hacker can enter our website

204
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,150
and everything and that is super good about  have

205
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,820
this communication and that this

206
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,190
communication is very clear with the teams

207
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,860
personally when I do bwin I will

208
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,500
evaluate the impact of my begué

209
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,380
slightly it means that I am going to

210
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,490
try it is is a friend who gave me this

211
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,990
advice when I started the bounty told me

212
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,090
you have to think  as a

213
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,670
malicious actor who is going to want to sell the

214
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,860
vulnerability on the dar nets and

215
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,590
you try to know how much money you are going to be

216
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,140
able to sell this vulnerability and

217
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,800
that is  What do I do when I make a report about

218
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,990
a program? I try to know how much

219
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,810
money I can sell it on the tag net

220
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,940
and the more money

221
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,660
I can sell it, the more impact it has and I will be

222
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,360
able to better explain the impact to the

223
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,889
teams

224
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:47,170
on things that is a bit strange to do

225
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,869
that.  But it helped me a lot when

226
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:51,699
I started the bec wind and because sometimes they

227
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,649
had him put skills and that it was

228
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,739
difficult to exploit and he told

229
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,779
me not to be able to sell that tonality

230
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,949
because nobody is interested in

231
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:06,730
doing that thing is so difficult and everything and

232
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,029
that in the end in that way I knew what

233
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,189
impact my vulnerabilities had

234
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,670
now we are going to talk about real cases of

235
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,410
how the impact of

236
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,310
vulnerabilities increases and to prepare for all

237
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,350
those cases we are going to talk about feces

238
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,720
is because I really like this

239
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,100
vulnerability and I think that in  the

240
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,480
community, as there are many

241
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,760
misunderstandings

242
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,629
about it, there is the impact

243
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,220
that if you do not know what one is, you

244
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,269
exist,

245
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,939
for example, when there is a formula

246
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:47,579
with  an input from a user and that you will be

247
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,690
able to make an injection

248
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,420
to have a javascript code that is

249
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,480
executed on the client side and

250
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,080
normally that javascript code will

251
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,750
be malicious and you will be able to excite

252
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,300
information to make a cover and things

253
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,970
like that

254
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,370
to the  First, the first case that I am going to

255
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,860
talk about is called call me, maybe it is a

256
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,110
vulnerability that I found in

257
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,839
hand and for the first time in

258
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,310
history, Mom, we are not going to make a

259
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,019
speech about a vulnerability that

260
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:23,850
we had in our systems,

261
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,819
which here serves as how we found  Where

262
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:29,550
coco when we find you exist in a

263
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,610
place we are like wow it is very shocking

264
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,079
and everything but it also exists is depends a

265
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,600
lot on the context here to find an

266
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,370
excess in a law and with the problem

267
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,199
of drought and it is that they do not have much

268
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,779
interaction with it  user means

269
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,670
that there is not a lot of functionality that

270
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,490
I can

271
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,670
that I can exploit to have more

272
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,990
impact than I had to how to use

273
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,490
a little more creativity to  find

274
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,209
a real impact and come with the

275
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:07,700
vulnerabilities to our

276
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,339
team and explain how an attacker

277
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,620
can do that can explain this

278
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,420
information and that is why we have

279
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,529
to do a mix of how very fast

280
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:23,930
and that if it is very rare because they have an

281
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,579
envelope  that of the drought and it is not

282
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,329
something that normally

283
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:32,430
happens because here what happens is that in

284
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,980
the pub we could put like a ball and it

285
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,809
gave us as an error a 404 error

286
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:45,480
that is usually in Jason but the

287
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,509
cost is that the content aip was in  text

288
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:51,720
ecm the one that in the end we could

289
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,850
execute an existence on the skin

290
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,060
that is very rare

291
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,120
and that at that time

292
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,190
my job was to identify the

293
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,200
perimeter because we are on the clean

294
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,010
that passes on the skin we have points

295
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,800
for clients that close everything

296
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,110
what will have the address of the

297
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,510
clients to all the settings of the

298
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,110
account etc. we will have a find

299
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,000
for the kart that says all the

300
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,280
products that a client will want to

301
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,160
buy re  They also join for the

302
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,050
products to have the description of

303
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,040
the products there are everything and know if

304
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,980
we can buy them or not and then

305
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,490
we have our connection point

306
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,770
to save to explain what I did

307
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,870
I have to start by explaining what

308
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,080
the ceim is  origin policy to the definition

309
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,580
of submit mozilla documentary is what

310
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,220
as rising policy restricts how a

311
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,590
script document loaded from one origin

312
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,740
can interact with resources from another

313
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,730
origin

314
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,480
and that is the part of the server that will

315
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,589
authorize that with two

316
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:10,800
lacrosse age origins  curls schering the

317
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,290
course and how are you going to be able to put two

318
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,269
stench that are the access control a

319
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,690
l'origine that will authorize a site from

320
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,470
an origin in origin must make a

321
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,860
request to the document you want and

322
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,959
then the access control to the

323
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,589
credential  Where are you going to put it, you will be

324
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:35,010
able to tell it if it can authorize if it

325
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,930
can use a cookie while it

326
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,740
makes the request and the fact is that we

327
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,470
put that on the server side and that

328
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,410
bro  wser in the browser that is going to

329
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,260
try how it is going to say if

330
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,350
we can go from the site to the site see

331
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,800
and here because we are

332
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,170
inside the epe there it is in the same

333
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,220
origin and that whatever the origin policy

334
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,950
says that we can make request inside

335
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,200
of  the same origin and that means

336
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,110
that from us you exist we can

337
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,030
make a request to the client's point

338
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,860


339
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,110
and one of the client's times that is

340
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,390
very interesting is how we have something that

341
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,110
is support to be with an idea and where is it going to

342
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,960
give us in a  jet request the first and

343
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,880
last names of the users and the

344
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,340
physical addresses of the users and also the

345
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,850
mobile number but the problem is that

346
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,550
the attacker has to have the Haitian and

347
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,910
that we do not have the air doing

348
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,250
that because we cannot know the air of

349
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,000
the  victim

350
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,820
from the beginning that you have to look for

351
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,770
all the times in which he makes a liquid

352
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,100
from the use of ride and for example what he

353
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,330
says that I was going to be like a crawl on

354
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,610
hand to hand and then use what is

355
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,550
called books is  rch to see if I

356
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,089
could find better haiti and I found

357
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:10,760
an in ponts that is imputed card that

358
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,349
gives you all the products that are

359
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,810
inside the products platform

360
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,900
but also the use of raid and that now

361
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,030
I have my milk and I will be able to exploit

362
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,310
this vulnerability

363
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,189
that that is like the javascript that I have

364
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:26,140
written

365
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,690
but for that more specific is those are

366
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,200
the lines the most interesting and that

367
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,540
everything that rich rune says is clean and

368
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,180
cards to grab the raid and then

369
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,040
I made a

370
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,900
user request with the  just wright and at that time

371
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,000
I had the mobile number and the address and

372
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,710
that is also why over

373
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,230
skill we call them with my maybe because we have a

374
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,500
mobile number and as for us

375
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,190
since we can have an impact on

376
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,100
the confidentiality and integrity of the

377
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,410
century  score

378
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,860
on the brush and rubble

379
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,190
at that moment

380
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,940
in which we play a score of 8.1 only

381
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,460
out of 10

382
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,900
but an excess can have more impact

383
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,520
depending on the context and for example

384
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,470
we grab a context  of having an

385
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,110
excess over wordpress

386
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,600
if you know wordpress of how the

387
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,470
different roles and for example there is a

388
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,410
user error that can access all the

389
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,070
public parts of the website there is an

390
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,530
editor role that can edit all the posts

391
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,950
on this site and yesterday the administrator

392
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,610
who  It is like above all that

393
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,480
everyone who accesses the administrative borders part of

394
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,710
the wordpress tarp

395
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,090
and in the end this overflow is very

396
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,669
important to know that it is on the

397
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:07,980
same origin as the website

398
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,360
and again we are going to talk about the sem origin

399
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,700
policy  because since we are in the

400
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,220
same origin it means that we are going to be

401
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,450
able to make requests from the

402
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,940
user part to the admin dashboard part

403
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,960
and doing that for example if

404
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,960
we do blog post one of monex is here and

405
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,100
we want to make request or blog of admin

406
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,740
the  dashboard

407
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,500
and brossa to say that there is no

408
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,929
problem doing that and you will be able to

409
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,270
make an iframe for example and then

410
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,030
edit the information inside the

411
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,910
iframe or more simply  e do ixe -

412
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,070
http request to david fleming's

413
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,950
and something interesting inside the dashboard

414
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,650
is that you can edit the themes and the

415
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,370
plugins and the plugins the themes are

416
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,810
written in kits which means that I

417
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,570
will be able to write a back door

418
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,570
inside  the themes and simply put it

419
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,250
a factor vaccine that goes

420
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,080
when I am going to make a guide trico is

421
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,280
aware and is going to execute my command

422
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,610
and that as the impact is going to be enormous and

423
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,710
for that to write another javascript or

424
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,040
media or

425
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,490
I started with

426
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,620
trying to stop the  names the names

427
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,350
are as if that network touch in wordpress it

428
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,320
means that it is a token that will

429
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,020
tell you if you can do an action and

430
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,810
here the action that tried to stop is the

431
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,559
editor theme to edit the theme

432
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,749
and then I go in the wang function that I

433
00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:04,720
I'm going to grab like the ball that is my

434
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,929
backdoor and I do that as a byte, we have

435
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,490
to say that the script dies at it and

436
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,669
that when it dies it gives us a notebook

437
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:17,919
the output will be like only the

438
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,900
result of my command  in the system

439
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,780
and then I am only going to do a doctor of the

440
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,240
subject because now I have the mons and I have

441
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,780
the pei what I want to make a bytes voice

442
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,380
and I am going to send a request so that it

443
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,640
writes my hair in the backend and at that

444
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,370
moment I will use  as the

445
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,180
imports function in javascript to

446
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,490
import as the malicious clip

447
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,240
inside the page when I am going to run

448
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,540
my exists and I will be able to use social

449
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,920
engineering to the cons the admins on the 3rd

450
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,090
and when it is going to be they will click

451
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,750
on my registered  malicious I am going to have

452
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,140
a back door and that is a one click at the

453
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,990
rate of discussion on wordpress

454
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,970
wants to be that when the admin is going

455
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,010
to click I am going to have an

456
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,039
exclusion rate that

457
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,979
we have as it exists is that it has as

458
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:27,840
much impact as possible  And it is kindness

459
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,830
sent by Angelique and there they made an

460
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,409
equal trade of vulnerability and

461
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:40,229
that just to say that

462
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:43,499
when companies give it more impact they will give it

463
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:46,950
a slightly higher rival and then it depends

464
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,109
on the subject of  security of all

465
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,629
companies but here negrelli who are very

466
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,999
mature from a security point of view

467
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,809
and who liked that

468
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,379
exploits a lot

469
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,960
there are many people who tell me

470
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,230
how the self exists they are useless and I

471
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,500
also believed

472
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,760
that until

473
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,940
someone tells me  that no, the affections

474
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,450
are and useful

475
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,110
to make exports and it is my friend adam to

476
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,570
see that he taught me a little life to adam

477
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,120
to give a bit of context is a bug

478
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,150
bounty hunter about they finish and that he will always

479
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,190
always find super

480
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,640
interesting things and he  he is the master of

481
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,010
grabbing a life of no impacts and

482
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,940
trying to find the highest

483
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,590
possible pact and I never know how that is and

484
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,930
I also really like to meet him because he is

485
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,750
a little crazy and we always laugh being

486
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,050
berwyn together

487
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,960
here the context of  that we found an

488
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,620
election where when I wrote something

489
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:09,440
in the search it told me that as what

490
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,720
I wrote and then I said I did not

491
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,350
find it,

492
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,210
the case is that when I wrote

493
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,539
written alert one it gave me a  excess but

494
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,490
there was no parameter there was

495
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,320
no post request that I could

496
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,470
exploit to give the link to another user

497
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,730
and to export it exists which is

498
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,160
why it was self

499
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,770
now someone told me let's check

500
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,350
if the website has as extreme

501
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,130
options that  it is a leader when it is set

502
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,070
with team it must be said that you cannot

503
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,250
make an iframe of the page that an

504
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,080
iframe in just saying it is a page

505
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,930
within another page and you can do

506
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,880
iframe cross origin but if the stench is

507
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,400
of knight you cannot do any  iframe

508
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,680
when the stench is seymour and jim

509
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,050
means that only the same origin can be

510
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,840
an iframe of the page and if there are no

511
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,420
editors it means that you can make

512
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,920
an iframe in all cases

513
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,260
and my son ok we have

514
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,510
no trans end that we can  make

515
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,510
an iframe let's space and king that's

516
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,300
something page hacking but that has no

517
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,150
impact my son yes because what we are going to

518
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,920
do is that we are going to have as a

519
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,320
string on the page called copy

520
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,740
me but how  do the user is going to be a

521
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,800
copy and when he is going to paste it will

522
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,620
have different values than when it is going to

523
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,980
be a copy he will have coppini but in

524
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,860
the end he will execute a script

525
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,090
and that in the end that was our little and

526
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,330
when did you do  A copy of eco pepper

527
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,200
of view could put it here the project

528
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,429
and there was an existing one already at that moment

529
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:08,410
we had an ecover account about the person

530
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:13,280
and that morality was sad

531
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,520
we had a good you for that purpose and

532
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,270
they did it to know and a half

533
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,030
because there was like  It was very

534
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,080
difficult to exploit, I didn't even

535
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,809
need his not very strong line, but

536
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:31,790
we went from elections that have

537
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:36,370
no impact to a medium impact

538
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,930
to conclude all that talk a bit

539
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,470
at the end to have more impact, you have to

540
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,890
understand the contexts as you have to

541
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,750
ask yourself where  I am what can I do

542
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,610
and what interactions the product has

543
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,120
with other products or functionalities and

544
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,090
then once they

545
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,370
exist as a mapping of what

546
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,830
they can do, you have to be u  n not very

547
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,800
creative and trying to adapt to the

548
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,250
company and leaving it what those for them

549
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,810
is an impact and trying to decorate a

550
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,850
bigger impact and then also chain

551
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,820
vulnerabilities between them to

552
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,710
find the impact of a bigger, for

553
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,750
example

554
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,330
energy, in a last example we find

555
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,060
that  Squeeze option was not set after

556
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,550
we say you see hacking exists is account

557
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,220
eco see that they linked skills at the

558
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,309
end can give more impact

559
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,220
than that is the end of my presentation if

560
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,760


561
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,940
you are questions for me that I will be

562
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,520
able to answer that there is no

563
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,380
tender I will  try to answer the

564
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,190
whole question thank you very much for

565
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,030
your attention and have a good day

566
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,720
everyone
