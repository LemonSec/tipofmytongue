my session

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,880
my name is serena but i think a lot of

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,760
people

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,320
online know me as she networks on both

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,880
tic tac and twitter

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,199
and uh if you're not very familiar with

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,560
me and what i do

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,080
i have been making tick tock content

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,440
since december of 2020 that is typically

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
uh related to networking and security

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,800
and posting on twitter kind of

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,960
really just whatever i want sometimes

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,440
it's technical sometimes it's not

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
but feel free to follow me on either of

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,399
those platforms if you are interested

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,920
a little bit of background on myself i

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,680
am a network engineer full-time i kind

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,079
of started my networking journey i think

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,680
i took my first ccna class in 2013 and

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,760
then i graduated college in 2018 with a

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,159
degree in computer information systems

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
and it had a concentration on networking

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,119
and information security then after that

26
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,760
after graduating i started a job and my

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,880
job was

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
mainly around compute

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
virtualization

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
and a lot of operating systems obviously

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,840
so vmware linux different things like

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,200
that and it was kind of more of a

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,560
support role

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,119
and now i am kind of helping people in

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,720
their data centers i've done data center

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
build i've done

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,079
now i'm kind of helping people integrate

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,119
in

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,680
newer systems with their older systems

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
and that's typically what i do

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,159
you know in

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
december of 2020 when i started making

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,119
tick tock content

44
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
um i'd recently discovered that there

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,880
was kind of

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,280
people making technical content on tick

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,439
tock and at the time there was really

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,719
only

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,880
a handful of people especially if you

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,119
took out anybody that was doing software

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
development

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,840
there was very few people making any

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
type of security related content and

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
they were doing really well because

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,239
there's a lot of people that are

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,000
interested in that content and there

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,640
wasn't a lot of people doing it and i at

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,319
the time was like

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,840
you know i i didn't really have any

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
social media presence at all so i think

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,080
i had like 50 followers on twitter and

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
i had maybe like i had a small instagram

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
account it was nothing crazy right

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,680
and

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,040
the first person that i saw making

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,519
technical content was

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,959
systems analyst

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,879
and he was doing a lot of stuff that i

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
do so a lot of networking and i was like

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,239
oh that's cool

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,160
i that's great that people are so

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
interested in your content and he really

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,440
encouraged me to kind of start making my

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,480
own

75
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,360
and so the first couple videos that i

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
had put out were

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
roasting linux users

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
based on what distro that they used

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,680
so obviously that went over

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,239
really well as you can imagine it went

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,120
over great um but it did get a lot of

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,040
traction and i think at that time was

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
really encouraging to me to continue to

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,040
make content and at the time i really

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,840
didn't know what i wanted to do with it

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
i didn't know really what people would

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,560
be interested in so a lot of my videos

88
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,400
were kind of jokes or tick tock trends

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,760
and

90
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
you know

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,680
i started to get

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,959
like just people asking real questions

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
on being a network engineer or how you

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,799
get into it and

95
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,920
you know

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
i started making content

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
that was more educational and a little

98
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,599
bit more useful than my funny trends

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,560
that i was doing at the time and that

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
really you know started to

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,920
gain even more traction from there

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,519
so

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,280
i started making more educational

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,480
content

105
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,319
around networking and then started

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,560
adding kind of some security in there as

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,599
well

108
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,560
and

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,439
i relied a lot of times on like what

110
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
people's questions were and then i would

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
just kind of answer them right there and

112
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,959
i started to gain even more attraction

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,160
and the majority of tick tock users are

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,519
i think

115
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,040
i mean they're early

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,720
they're younger than 20s and below i

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
think 33

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
of all tick tock users

119
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,199
are

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
19 years old or younger and so a lot of

121
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,280
people in that

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,759
time that time in their life are really

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,960
just trying to figure out what they want

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
to do

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,360
they

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
might be interested in a

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
career in security but they don't really

128
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,280
know how to

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,960
do that and they're trying to figure it

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,840
out

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,639
and part of my content is me

132
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,080
trying to put myself in their shoes

133
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,160
because i really wasn't there that long

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
ago

135
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,080
and

136
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,720
if you haven't had to find a security

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
job recently as an entry level

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
it's changed a lot within the last like

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
10 15 years and

140
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,400
it's it's become a lot harder to achieve

141
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,199
that

142
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,880
career

143
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
than it was back then so

144
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,919
you know i think providing kind of these

145
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,720
resources on tick tock is

146
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,639
it's been great and it's a great way to

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,199
put out more information and give it to

148
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,880
people who might not have been even

149
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600
looking for it and that's kind of what's

150
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,160
the really redeeming part about using

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,639
tick tock and what makes it different

152
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,600
than other platforms see

153
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
you know

154
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
one you have a lot of young adults who

155
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,919
are trying to figure out their career

156
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,919
and then two you have an algorithm on

157
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,600
tick tock where if you show kind of a

158
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,199
slight interest in technology you'll

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,960
start getting a lot more videos on your

160
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,320
4u page

161
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,919
about technology because of their

162
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,680
algorithm and then from there you can

163
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
start following people who you want to

164
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,080
see more content from

165
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
and this is great even for people who

166
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
maybe aren't even looking for

167
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,280
a full career and technology

168
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
they might just want to know how to

169
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,120
better their security like they want to

170
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,000
know about multi-factor authentication

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
or

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,919
you know

173
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,919
there's obviously some really popular

174
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
videos from other creators too about you

175
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,039
know how to protect themselves um from

176
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,880
like carding or different things like

177
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,639
that and they might not even be fully

178
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,479
interested in and it's been cool because

179
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,039
i've seen people that follow me who are

180
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,360
pilots who are maintenance people who

181
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
are truckers and

182
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
they have this interest

183
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
but it's not what they're doing

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
full-time and it might not even be what

185
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,319
they want to do full-time but even just

186
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,919
having your own

187
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,960
you know security awareness is fantastic

188
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
that i am able to kind of reach these

189
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
people who may not have traditionally

190
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,599
found my content or other kind of

191
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,039
related content because they weren't

192
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,199
necessarily like searching it out but

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
tiktok has now provided it to them uh

194
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,199
based on the algorithm which is cool

195
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,560
and

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,160
the other thing is with you know short

197
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,919
form content

198
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,720
that is a challenge i mean

199
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,960
i don't think

200
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,199
anybody was challenged before to explain

201
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,039
dhcp in under 60 seconds

202
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,479
and so

203
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,960
that i like i like that about tick-tock

204
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,319
because you kind of start to lose

205
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,800
people's attention i would say

206
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
especially on tic toc

207
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
really quickly so you have to start off

208
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
with a good hook that's going to get

209
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,039
people's attention and wanting to watch

210
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,199
more video and then you have about until

211
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,000
like 20 to 30 seconds to like

212
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,599
really hook them in if you're gonna

213
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,960
expect them to make it to the minute

214
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,000
mark so that is been interesting and

215
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
that's been a challenge just providing

216
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
this information

217
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,639
in under 60 seconds and i think people

218
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,639
don't feel like their time

219
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,280
is being wasted or you're really

220
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
drawing out

221
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,440
a concept that can be

222
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,560
much more

223
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,919
simple

224
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,560
and simplified in a way that really

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
anybody can understand it even without

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,039
having too much of an in-depth technical

227
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,520
background

228
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
so this is why i really like tik tok and

229
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,280
i know there is controversy around tik

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
tok especially

231
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,800
as a security professional you know what

232
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,879
what is like the danger of tick tock is

233
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,680
it really kind of the spyware that i

234
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
think some people have tried to make it

235
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,319
out to be you know personally

236
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,000
i say no

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,399
and i ended up doing a

238
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,799
20-page research paper about tik-tok

239
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,839
that had about 40 different

240
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,000
sources and at the end of it i truly

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,560
concluded that it's not any more

242
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
dangerous or

243
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,080
any more spyware-like than any other

244
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,519
platform that you're using for social

245
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,240
media whether it be twitter or facebook

246
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,040
instagram whatsapp

247
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
they all kind of have the same

248
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
policies

249
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
and

250
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
ultimately i think that

251
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,120
a lot of the hype around tick tock being

252
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,640
a security issue was politically

253
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,800
motivated however i will let you kind of

254
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
do your own research and decide for on

255
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,000
your own you know if it's something that

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,839
you are interested in using or not i

257
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,560
mean there's a lot of ways out to put

258
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,399
your content out there and to share what

259
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,839
you do and what you love to do with

260
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,880
people outside of tick tock without also

261
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
being said

262
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,720
take talk is still in kind of its early

263
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
days of

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,760
i guess existence in general and

265
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,920
content moderation especially around

266
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,320
security content can be especially

267
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,519
tricky

268
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,160
i know that youtube had this problem

269
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
early on as well and i think it's kind

270
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,640
of adapted and changed since then

271
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,000
but

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,880
you know a lot of security content on

273
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,959
tick tock does get moderated off the

274
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,680
platform which is really frustrating and

275
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,560
i

276
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
am hoping that they are

277
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,880
you know kind of working on that

278
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,720
especially where i think a lot of the

279
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,399
stuff that is getting moderated off is

280
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
kind of the equivalent of like a

281
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,600
corporate

282
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,000
security awareness training

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
which generally i think on tick tock is

284
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
probably more effective than most

285
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
corporate security trainings because

286
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,680
it's short and it's concise and it's

287
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,279
entertaining because if it wasn't you

288
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,279
wouldn't watch it right and the only

289
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,519
reason you typically watch it at work is

290
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,040
because you're forced to

291
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,839
um

292
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,519
and while some people do really try and

293
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,959
make some good corporate security

294
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,399
training most people

295
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
when it's assigned to them

296
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,440
they're not as interested in it

297
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,839
so that is one problem with tick tock

298
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
where you kind of have to be careful and

299
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
understand that you might get some

300
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,760
videos taken down and you might have to

301
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
appeal them and hopefully they'll get

302
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
restored in some cases they might not

303
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,320
get restored

304
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,959
you know aside from me there are a lot

305
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,320
of

306
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,040
great creators on tech talk and as i put

307
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,519
myself in the category of great creators

308
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,079
um but you know there's people that are

309
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,360
doing a lot that is useful for

310
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,959
people who are just entering into the

311
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,920
field

312
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,640
or

313
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
people that are just kind of general

314
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,120
educating and

315
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
for general public

316
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
one of my favorite creators his name is

317
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
kyle um tobiner and he's been making

318
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
tick tock content around security and

319
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,680
he's a cso but also has been like a vp

320
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
of security at you know large

321
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,160
corporation and you know that type of

322
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,720
insight is very valuable to people and

323
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
one of the things that he does is a

324
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,480
series of just kind of

325
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,680
reviewing

326
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,240
uh job listings for entry-level security

327
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,120
positions because as we know

328
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
sometimes you review entry-level job

329
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,000
listings and they are in fact not entry

330
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,399
level at all so this can be really

331
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,079
confusing for people

332
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
who are looking for entry-level work and

333
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,440
thinking like

334
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
i don't have this experience like i

335
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,399
don't have all this like i'm looking for

336
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,279
you know my first job like what do i do

337
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,720
how do i land my first job so him kind

338
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,200
of making this content that really dives

339
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,160
into

340
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,720
what to look for on an entry-level job

341
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,560
application

342
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,880
is really helpful and

343
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,160
um kind of is good because

344
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,680
again

345
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,959
security and tech can

346
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,519
kind of be

347
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,480
daunting for new people and it has

348
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
sometimes a high bar of entry so being

349
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,120
like hey this is what you should look

350
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,760
for this is a good role and then

351
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,279
hopefully some of these companies will

352
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,200
also update some of their listings and

353
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,959
think like okay maybe this is an entry

354
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,360
level how can i make this entry level

355
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,440
maybe we should take off

356
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,480
the requirement that you have a cissp or

357
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,839
maybe we should

358
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,399
take off the requirement of you having

359
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
three years of experience already in the

360
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,000
field

361
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,279
which seems kind of obvious but you know

362
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,839
another creator that is making security

363
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,560
content is make it happen

364
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,399
and he does security tag videos which is

365
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,399
different than what you would think like

366
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,959
a traditional maybe like appsec type

367
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,959
content would be your network security

368
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,040
content kind of more what i do

369
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,600
um but yeah just like lots of people are

370
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
interested in oh like a security tag

371
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,240
like how can you disable this and that

372
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,639
is kind of just like a fundamental thing

373
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,079
right if you think about like lock

374
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,800
picking um we can think about

375
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,639
how to disable a security tag and

376
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,959
that is interesting he'll use like

377
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,040
bubble gum or

378
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,959
freezing security tags or different

379
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,800
things like that and that is super

380
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
interesting as well and just kind of

381
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,320
understanding like how do those work

382
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,880
like what mechanisms are being used to

383
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,199
actually make those function and of

384
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,800
course there's a lot of different types

385
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,480
so understanding the different types as

386
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,560
well and it ultimately comes down to

387
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
just like how curious are you about this

388
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,360
technology and those videos do really

389
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,480
well i mean

390
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,360
um millions of views some in some cases

391
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,959
which is fantastic because you know

392
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,480
those are also reaching people who might

393
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,079
not really have a background in security

394
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,880
but are obviously still very curious and

395
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,519
so how can we kind of like showcase that

396
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,279
and how can we spread information that

397
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,120
way and take talk's been a great

398
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,279
platform to do it and i'm sure a lot of

399
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,920
people have seen malwaretech's videos as

400
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
well i think one of his

401
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,760
for uh security cameras and airbnbs did

402
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,480
about 20 million views which is nuts

403
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,959
congrats to him that's awesome um but

404
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,480
he's also done things about like

405
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,440
proxmark and card cloning

406
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,560
and um a couple other like very popular

407
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,480
videos and those are a lot of times

408
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,440
about kind of just personal security and

409
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,000
knowing that this technology exists and

410
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
of course you're gonna get comments of

411
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,560
like why are you teaching people how to

412
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,399
hack and

413
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,519
i think people kind of

414
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,360
sometimes they don't quite understand

415
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
that to be able to

416
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,920
really protect yourself you know from

417
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,959
this type of thing you have to know that

418
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,480
it exists if you don't know that it

419
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,160
exists or it's possible it's very hard

420
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,199
to

421
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,920
really protect yourself from it so

422
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,880
um

423
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,110
you know that there's still some

424
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,040
[Music]

425
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
issues in that realm where people might

426
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,480
think that you are trying to teach

427
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,000
people how to hack we're really trying

428
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,560
to teach people that hey this exists and

429
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,920
you should be aware of it so that you

430
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,440
can protect yourself

431
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,399
from it so don't be surprised you

432
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,720
probably already aren't surprised but if

433
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,639
you do get those types of comments they

434
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,959
definitely happen and i think that's

435
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,800
another reason why some of this

436
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,759
um

437
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,800
security or hacking content kind of gets

438
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,360
taken down from tiktok is because of

439
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,600
that same thought process as oh you're

440
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,839
teaching people how to do this but

441
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,759
a lot of times there is

442
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,440
hours of setup before you even make a 60

443
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
second video that's not shown and

444
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,160
sometimes there is

445
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
you're gonna need some fundamental

446
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
understanding of how to use a lot of

447
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,560
this equipment how you're going to get

448
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,240
the scripts or if you get the scripts if

449
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,839
you write your own scripts or you know

450
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,519
the different options that they're that

451
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,880
there is

452
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,199
now obviously the theme of this whole

453
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,240
thing ultimately is content creation and

454
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
how it's useful for not only just

455
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,880
showing off your knowledge and what

456
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,440
you're doing but also helping new people

457
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,160
so

458
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,399
a lot of times i have recommended to

459
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,279
people

460
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,160
um

461
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
especially when you do like try and hack

462
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,600
me there's people that do their own

463
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,079
write-up so that's definitely so useful

464
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,839
when people do their own write-ups and

465
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,519
occasionally like when i've gone through

466
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,360
them i'm like i have to use maybe a

467
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,800
couple write-ups some information might

468
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,720
be missing so it's always helpful that

469
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
there's been more than one but also like

470
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,480
if you think that you can do a good job

471
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
of writing this up like do it i

472
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,920
encourage you to do it because maybe

473
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,639
your way of writing up this information

474
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
will resonate better with

475
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
somebody else right

476
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
um

477
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,000
blogs are another great way another way

478
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
is youtube so i've been watching a lot

479
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
of john hammond's videos um of him even

480
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,079
going through try and hack me or just

481
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
doing some malware analysis because

482
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,679
that's an area that i don't have a lot

483
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,640
of experience on but i think is good

484
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
that i'm just curious about and want to

485
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
learn more about so watching somebody

486
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,679
else who

487
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,640
is

488
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,079
you know knowledgeable in this area and

489
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
has been doing this for a long time is

490
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,360
extremely helpful for people who are

491
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
just coming into the field and uh

492
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,520
sometimes like i'll watch some of

493
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
someone's walkthrough video walkthrough

494
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,000
of try and hack me or hack the box and

495
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,559
then i'll go try it myself and that has

496
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,400
been really good just because sometimes

497
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
like maybe you don't have the energy to

498
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
actually go through and do it yourself

499
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
and get everything set up but you still

500
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,919
want to learn and see maybe somebody

501
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,320
else's logic so putting out your own

502
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
content even if it's not on tick tock

503
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,360
even if it's not on youtube is super

504
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,679
helpful and people have made you know

505
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,440
even really great

506
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,080
twitter content of just like hey these

507
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,679
are linux commands that you should know

508
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,280
and i've like saved some of those even

509
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
if i'm like i know most of these

510
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
commands it's like cool to refer back to

511
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,120
that later and maybe you might learn

512
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
something that you didn't know before

513
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,400
out of all of the things that they had

514
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,919
posted right

515
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,000
so it's really important to

516
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,520
put your content out there for new

517
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,440
people but also just get yourself

518
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,080
visibility and recognition the other

519
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,000
thing that i have recommended especially

520
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
on hacker one for people who are

521
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,200
interested in bug bounties and security

522
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,799
and something that i've done is gone

523
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,400
through other people's like disclosed

524
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,720
reports because

525
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,120
like that way of just seeing the logic

526
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
and getting ideas of like how maybe that

527
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,280
method could be implemented on maybe a

528
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,600
different website or you know just

529
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,960
another way to look at a problem or way

530
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,880
to look at bug bounty especially you

531
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,480
know for a lot of people who are new to

532
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
it like i'm new at a lot of the appsec

533
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,120
stuff i do a lot of networking security

534
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,840
but you know the actual app application

535
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,559
security stuff is new and other people's

536
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,400
reports especially when they are well

537
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
put together and well detailed is a

538
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,240
great learning tool there's so many

539
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,720
options that people kind of don't think

540
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
about that are completely free like you

541
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
don't have to pay

542
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,320
tons of money to

543
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
you know a training resource when there

544
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,600
is all this other free content out there

545
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
and i want to also contribute to that

546
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
content so that you know i can encourage

547
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,760
people to get into this field or even

548
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,880
just up their own personal security

549
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,320
and i hope that through this talk i am

550
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,960
encouraging other people and you to

551
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,559
you know share your knowledge as well

552
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,520
and if you're interested in it it can be

553
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
it's frightening to put yourself out

554
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,720
there like that right and it is scary

555
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,080
because you know you always think like

556
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
somebody who is gonna know more about

557
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,480
this is gonna come around and

558
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
tell me i'm wrong or that there's a

559
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
different way and yeah that's probably

560
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
gonna happen it happens to me and

561
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,320
it sucks sometimes but also like there's

562
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
a lot of ways to do things there's not

563
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,039
always one specifically right way i know

564
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,640
i did a

565
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,960
video on um

566
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
hydra and that got a lot of like oh this

567
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
is never gonna work because of obviously

568
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,720
you have attempt lockout and things like

569
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
that and while it's true

570
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,960
um you know it's still something to

571
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
learn and test and try and hack me and

572
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,600
just learn about these tools and nobody

573
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,840
starts off in this field an expert and

574
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,120
people really need to kind of give

575
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
themselves a little bit more grace and

576
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
be like hey i'm not an expert i'm just

577
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
learning the saying but i want to share

578
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,919
