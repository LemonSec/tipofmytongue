welcome to infosec a broken industry

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,519
that keeps it insecure and risky and i'm

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,039
very excited to talk about this because

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,279
it's something close to my heart about

9
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,320
burnout but also i get to touch about

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,719
how our industry could really use some

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,280

for everyone

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,719
on how to reduce burnout and i just want

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,040
to say that this talk is just

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,680
just really putting out there that

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
burnout is not

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,879
caused by you it's not about self-care

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,239
anymore it is about how we are

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,480
in this certain system that we are

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,760
placed in and how it keeps causing us to

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,600
get burned out which i'm going to touch

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,920
now let's get into the real reason why

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,960
you're here today

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,360
i just want to say that you may be here

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,799
right now

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,520
let's be honest with one another

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,040
the pandemic

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
there was no guide on how to survive it

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,360
and we're still in a pandemic

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
and we are on a fine line of just being

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,680
okay

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,160
and not being okay

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
and we've been dealing with burnout even

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,200
before the

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,520
pandemic within our industry so that's

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
why it's important for us to talk about

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,760
this because even if when the pandemic

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,840
is over we still have to address this

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,879
with burnout we do place ourselves an

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,760
organization at a security risk we're

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,560
more likely to click on a link

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,440
because we're not 100 who we are because

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,400
our

66
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
we are not a full completely charged

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
battery in a sense so we're going to

68
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,959
make a lot more mistakes

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,519
we may not even patch correctly um we

70
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,680
may be overwhelmed of what is needed to

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,959
be patched

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,440
but also let's be real

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,400
sometimes us being insecurity

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,720
people see us as kind of like robots and

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,519
not humans and this is one of the things

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,920
is that within security itself we're

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
expected to work 24 7 and always be at

78
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
the edge of our seat 24 7

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,400
because that is what's expected of us is

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,200
to work all hours and be expected to be

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,080
on calls at all hours because

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,200
security is 24 7.

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,159
so

84
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,000
at the end of the day is how do you even

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
balance a personal life and work life

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,799
because the reality is is that if we're

87
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,440
not balancing our work and personal life

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,560
that's when we start having burnout

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,440
because that balance is gone

90
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,080
so you may even see signs of it such as

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,239
like

92
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,120
you've

93
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
noticed changes with your colleagues

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,879
even with yourself

95
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,680
they

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,159
may be withdrawn or fast to become angry

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,680
and sad

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
you might see delay and responses or

99
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,080
projects and this could be seen remote

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,519
too you don't have to actually be in

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,360
person to know if someone's burned out

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,400
or not

103
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
but this is the thing is to understand

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
is that since we've been remote

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,720
um and also since we've been working

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,799
from home in the pandemic the thing is

107
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,320
is that it's incredibly hard to put a

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,199
line in the sand saying this is my work

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,918
time this is my personal time and

110
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,600
putting boundaries down

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
because it's almost impossible in the

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
past to have boundaries when you work in

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,919
security

114
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
but the thing is is that i think at this

115
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,040
point

116
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
we are starting to realize if we don't

117
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
put down boundaries when we're not

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
practicing more balancing of work and

119
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
personal life

120
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
we end up getting burned out and the

121
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,360
effects can be really bad

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
and for those that aren't aware of how

123
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,759
bad burnout can start forming and

124
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,040
looking like

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
it used to be that it took a few minutes

126
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,240
to respond to an email now it takes

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
hours or days you may feel exhausted and

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,039
trapped you might even feel empty you

129
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,039
may push yourself to like this breaking

130
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
point and it's almost impossible to come

131
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,000
up with new ideas or new strategies and

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
then you start getting some aches here

133
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,000
and there as well

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,479
you get overly anxious over events and

135
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,880
deadlines you can get angry or you can

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,120
get sad very fast

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,400
and the other thing is that you may even

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
not respond to your friends and family

139
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,199
at you know at a certain time not

140
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,240
because you're busy it's because

141
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
you're worried that that's gonna be

142
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,680
another task on top of everything and

143
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
that's when you start having this guilt

144
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,639
that comes in

145
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,320
and when that guilt starts coming in

146
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,080
it's reminding you that your personal

147
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
life is now slipping your work has

148
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,759
become your life

149
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,479
and then when your life is your work you

150
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,720
start feeling under appreciated for

151
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
everything that you have given up to be

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,759
in that role or where you work

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,639
and then you get resentful at your work

154
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,720
now when you get resentful this ends up

155
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
being this change of hating and dreading

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,160
going to your job this is the moment

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
that you do lose team members so burnout

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,919
is something very very serious

159
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,840
and it's not just that but also when we

160
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,560
don't address burnout this can happen to

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
your body you're going to feel exhausted

162
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
you're going to struggle to sleep

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,280
you can you'll start mimicking the same

164
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,440
symptoms as anxiety and depression

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,120
you'll start noticing that you get sick

166
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
more often your muscles get tight and

167
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,280
sore you might get more headaches

168
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,600
suddenly or

169
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,520
gastrointestinal issues as well

170
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,440
and

171
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,199
cardiovascular problems increase so this

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,880
gives you a higher

173
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,039
chance of

174
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,880
the stress that's been prolonged for too

175
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,000
long so you have

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,479
high blood pressure and heart attacks

177
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,080
and strokes

178
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,440
because there's too much adrenaline

179
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,599
corsal in your body over an extended

180
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,280
time

181
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,440
so burnout is not a joke it is something

182
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,599
serious and no matter how much you push

183
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,280
it and you don't want to address it the

184
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,080
thing is it will hit you and when it

185
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,280
does it will hit you hard

186
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,599
so the thing is is why are we burnt out

187
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,479
within our industry like i said before

188
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,479
we operate 24 7 around the clock

189
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,000
and even in the middle of night that

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
means if i get a phone call at two or

191
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,919
three in the morning that means i need

192
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,319
to take that phone call because it's

193
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,240
important because i don't want to put

194
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,199
anyone at risk and neither do you so

195
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,039
that's the thing is like we're always

196
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,440
around the clock it's very hard to ever

197
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,240
have a moment of just relaxing or

198
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
whether or not

199
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
one is the call going to happen that

200
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
there's a breach

201
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,759
because the thing is attackers they go

202
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,160
at all hours and we're always knowing

203
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,479
that a breach is going to occur it will

204
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,440
occur eventually we just don't know when

205
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,000
and this is the thing

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,160
we're also really scared when there is a

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
breach because we know that is most

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,479
likely going to be an ad hoc style to

209
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,000
fix it

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
because the reality is according to the

211
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
opponent institute while security

212
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
response planning is slowly improving

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,759
year after year that the vast majority

214
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,599
of organizations

215
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
74 of them

216
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,199
reported not having

217
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,160
a any incident response plan or having

218
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,440
an ad hoc plan when it comes to having a

219
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,879
breach

220
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,039
this also means that those that did have

221
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,319
plans in the first place

222
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,000
they didn't have any time of when

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,159
they're going to review or when they

224
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,080
were going to

225
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,599
test them out or revisit them at a date

226
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,159
and this is really scary for us because

227
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,000
well we don't have up-to-date plans

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
how how are we

229
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
it's the the just amount of stress and

230
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
weight on our shoulders of

231
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,680
how are we going to deal with this when

232
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
this crisis happens so this is why it's

233
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,080
important if we put more attention

234
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,200
towards preparing and prevention we have

235
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
a better chance of feeling like more

236
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,519
we're a little bit less stressed

237
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,080
but this also allows us to know that if

238
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
we are burned out and we have a call

239
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
saying that there is a breach

240
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,279
we have a procedure that's intact that

241
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,600
we can actually utilize

242
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,399
now the other thing is is that 94

243
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,560
of the forbes 2000 list still don't have

244
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
vulnerability disclosure policies so

245
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
this is another hard thing for

246
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,680
uh having security plans is that if you

247
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
don't have security strategy that

248
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,000
doesn't incorporate having a bug bounty

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
program and or a vulnerability

250
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,720
disclosure policies

251
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,920
it is a horrible situation because the

252
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,839
thing is there's too much reliance on a

253
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,720
security team and we need diverse eyes

254
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,279
to find bugs so then

255
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,160
we're able to fix it but it also is one

256
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
of those things that we have to

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,959
come

258
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,839
to this point in our industry is that we

259
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,680
need to build a bridge between the

260
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,800
hacker community and the companies

261
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
because the reality is if we don't build

262
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
that bridge we're going to keep having

263
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,160
these situations and we could have

264
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
avoided many breaches

265
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,120
if we had those programs set up

266
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,760
and of course what we tend to do in our

267
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
industry is that

268
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,279
we forget about that there's a human

269
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,760
element at play so what we do is we

270
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,839
throw tools hoping that that's going to

271
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,680
fix the situation

272
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,000
um and and what i mean by that is that

273
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
right now organizations use more than 45

274
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,040
different security tools

275
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,200
and you don't even know how much you can

276
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,079
trust that um but also usually our

277
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,640
incident response plan coordination

278
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,320
has approximately 19 tools as well now

279
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,120
are those tools updated

280
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,000
how secure are those tools

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
uh were there more tools added to them

282
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,320
because remember most of the plans that

283
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,880
we have already don't exist or they're

284
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,680
out of date the other thing is that more

285
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,079
tools part of the process means that

286
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,920
there's going to be a slower remediation

287
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,880
time and it's going to cost more money

288
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,440
and let me paint a picture of how

289
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
stressful this situation is for a

290
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,160
security team now

291
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,279
i want you to imagine that you're on

292
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,600
a crew and you're on this cruise ship

293
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,680
and you just found out that your ship is

294
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
sinking but you found out a little bit

295
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
late because you weren't alerted by your

296
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
system on time

297
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
your customers are bored

298
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
and they're trusting you for their

299
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,040
safety now the one thing to remember is

300
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,079
that your team is a bit scared this is a

301
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,839
brand new situation even though they've

302
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,519
practiced multiple times on what to do

303
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,120
in this situation the thing is is that

304
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,880
they're scared because they're suddenly

305
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,959
in the heat of the moment

306
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,120
but the thing to also keep in mind is

307
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,600
that there is this fear

308
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
of failing that can paralyze people too

309
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
when they're in uh

310
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,240
you know when they're dealing with a

311
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
crisis

312
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,560
so the thing to keep in mind here is

313
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
that your team your crew is trying their

314
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,519
best to keep everything afloat and to

315
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,120
make sure that everyone is going to be

316
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,399
okay with the ship going down now there

317
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,839
is a catch here

318
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,160
your team hasn't really slept well

319
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,639
um they also feel a little seasick so

320
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
you could kind of say that they're

321
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
kind of processing and operating as if

322
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,600
they have burnout in other words they

323
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
are not exactly 100 state of mind

324
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,560
and this is something to keep in mind

325
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,800
so now you have the backstory now i want

326
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,360
you to imagine your captain pulls out

327
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
the safety binder

328
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,600
at to know what is the protocol for this

329
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,040
ship

330
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,320
but unfortunately that binder

331
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,279
that was updated is not on that ship at

332
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,079
all so you're using an old procedure but

333
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,399
have new features to the ship and your

334
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,720
team is burned out in a sense because

335
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,639
they're seasick and they're paralyzed by

336
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,279
the fear of failing are you stressed out

337
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,720
now because this is what it's like

338
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,920
when we deal with bad plans and when the

339
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
human element is taken out it leaves you

340
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
with a wreckage

341
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,279
literally

342
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
the truth is is that bad actors are

343
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,200
everywhere and they tech all hours and

344
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
zero days drop often and we constantly

345
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,920
need to be up to date of what bad actors

346
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,320
use this takes time and energy and this

347
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,839
is why we're struggling because we're

348
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,600
part of a crew

349
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
but

350
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
we don't function well or communicate

351
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
well it could become a really scary

352
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,440
situation and the reason is that we are

353
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,880
insecurity

354
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,240
because we know it's incredibly

355
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,639
important to protect one another

356
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,800
and the other thing is to keep in mind

357
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
is that we've also come to terms that we

358
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,040
work around the clock and we don't even

359
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,279
have time to practice self-care because

360
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,079
of the demand and the stress of where

361
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,160
what we're doing

362
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,199
so

363
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,440
you have to understand where we come to

364
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
a place in our career we might be like

365
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
what is the point of this

366
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,920
if our employer isn't helping us or our

367
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,839
industry isn't changing

368
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,160
how are we going to change things in a

369
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,720
sense

370
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,600
and this is why burnout matters is that

371
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,920
if we keep turning to tools

372
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,720
and we don't find the time to digest the

373
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,800
human element of this that is in play

374
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,639
we're never going to be able to get

375
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,480
where we want to go with our security

376
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
team and that is the reason why

377
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,399
we also need to rely on the hacker

378
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,800
community because the reality is the

379
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
hacker community is going to find the

380
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,160
bugs your security team cannot find

381
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
and this is important to note because

382
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
it's better to have the hacker committee

383
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,519
find those vulnerabilities than an

384
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,199
attacker to get a hold of that

385
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,519
vulnerability and not report it to you

386
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,920
and take advantage of you you don't want

387
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
to breach right none of us want to

388
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
breach that's why we're in this in the

389
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,720
first place

390
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
and that's why we have to understand

391
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,040
something which is

392
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,600
we cannot overly rely on our security

393
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,959
teams to find all the bugs

394
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,600
because the reality is that your team is

395
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,560
most likely burned out at some point or

396
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,800
at least one person is going to burn out

397
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,199
on your team at all times

398
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,519
and so this is the thing is is that we

399
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,120
need to understand that having

400
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,600
vulnerability disclosure policies and

401
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,160
bug bounty programs are incredibly

402
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,880
important to our strategy when it comes

403
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,399
to security

404
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
but also

405
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,880
it allows us to

406
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,079
partner with individuals that are trying

407
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,160
to help us in other words

408
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
now the thing i wanted to say is that

409
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,279
when you do have a bug bounty of honor

410
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839
really disclosure policies in place it's

411
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,680
so incredibly important

412
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,160
that you have someone who can manage

413
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,040
inquiries and delegate bugs and also can

414
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,600
be on top of communicating and this is

415
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,920
why having a bug bounty program such as

416
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,399
hacker one it's incredibly important to

417
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,600
have that

418
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,240
it makes it easier for communicating for

419
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
finding and fixing those bugs faster

420
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
than ever which does keep you protected

421
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,360
from attackers

422
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,560
now for the bug bounty hunters that are

423
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,720
listening to this

424
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,839
first of all

425
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,480
thank you for doing what you do

426
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,360
because

427
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
we need you at the end of the day we

428
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,199
need you even if organizations don't

429
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,120
have honorably disclosure policies or a

430
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,680
bug batting program they will one day

431
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,160
because they will realize they need you

432
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,040
too

433
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,279
we can't always rely on our own team we

434
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,600
have to get outside help

435
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
now the thing i can tell

436
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
from your perspective is that the

437
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
reality is that

438
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,160
we can put in so many hours to find bugs

439
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,759
and there comes no point where we don't

440
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,079
find things for weeks and months and

441
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,079
this can be alarming and this can be

442
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,199
scary and the reality is that sometimes

443
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,119
we just need to take a break

444
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,640
taking a break from everything from

445
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
infosec and then coming back a week

446
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,119
later you'll feel a lot more refreshed

447
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,959
but the thing is is that bug bounty

448
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,760
hunters it's it's a lot of hours and

449
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,039
dedication if you're doing this

450
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,799
full-time and especially if you're doing

451
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,880
this part-time and having a full-time

452
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,679
security job it's a lot of work so

453
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,839
trying to find time to balance that

454
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,039
personal life is also really hard

455
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,360
but the other thing is stressful is like

456
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,919
waiting for the communication

457
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,320
like there it could be terrible i'll be

458
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,799
honest there's delays and expectations a

459
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,720
conflict all the time when trying to get

460
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
paid out or getting an update on the bug

461
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
that you submitted and this can be also

462
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
very stressful and when we have so much

463
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,160
stress that isn't being dealt with this

464
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,559
ends up turning it into burnout

465
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,200
so it's really important that

466
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,480
when we report to an organization is for

467
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,799
us to both understand

468
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,559
that

469
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,600
we're all

470
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,480
part of a situation and we all have

471
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,200
wants and desires and it's also a really

472
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,640
stressful to be in this industry and i

473
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,160
want to talk about that a little bit

474
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,640
further into this conversation

475
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,880
but first i just want to say is that

476
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,799
overall i hope

477
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,520
from the beginning of this conversation

478
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
is that everyone's pretty much burned

479
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,640
out at some point or at this very moment

480
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,039
and that is the reality of everything is

481
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,200
that with coven 19 we're taking care of

482
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,600
family members we're on camera daily

483
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
we're unable to leave our home sometimes

484
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,760
we can't see our friends and family and

485
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
some of us live alone some of us put off

486
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,919
some really important life events

487
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,640
and some of us have lost people because

488
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
of the pandemic

489
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
and our colleagues are struggling we're

490
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
struggling some of us are worried at

491
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,640
keeping a job some of us are doing bug

492
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,720
bounty for a living

493
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,080
because

494
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,960
we are trying every way possible to get

495
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,720
funds in our pocket

496
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,600
it's a very weird time

497
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,559
and the thing is it's okay to be honest

498
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,760
and say

499
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,679
now let's be honest with one another is

500
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,120
that

501
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,039
we can't keep doing everything all the

502
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,280
time and that's okay

503
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,600
but the thing is is that

504
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
we have to figure this out as an

505
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,840
industry of how to do something better

506
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,679
because the human element created

507
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,240
security and runs on security and we're

508
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
all struggling right now to a certain

509
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,919
extent so

510
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
let's change this problem and dive into

511
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,840
five investments that we can do

512
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,480
so first things first listen and take

513
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,600
action together be strong be kind

514
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,559
ask your team what do they need don't

515
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,039
just listen and and then

516
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,120
you know not take actions the thing is

517
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,679
we have to take actions so listen to one

518
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,240
another and try to get a good idea of

519
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,799
what you can do to help out the

520
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,320
situation

521
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
and because that is the reality of

522
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
what's going on is that even on secure

523
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
teams we're not being able to

524
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,640
communicate what is needed

525
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
um it might be like hey we don't need

526
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,159
this tool anymore there's this other

527
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,640
tool that there's three things in one um

528
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,679
it could also be about trying to get

529
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,559
uh helping your cso out to go to the

530
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,240
board to push for vulnerability

531
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,520
disclosure policies or to get funds

532
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,400
um to even invest in the security team

533
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,799
and you know and that's the reality is

534
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,760
is asking people around you how can you

535
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,720
help

536
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,159
because the reality is that we kind of

537
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,159
have to work together to kind of get out

538
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,880
of this mess

539
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,120
like i said listening to one another and

540
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
taking action is definitely important

541
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
but also planning together so if you're

542
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
on a security team it's really important

543
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,480
is to create strategies and revisit your

544
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
security response plan making sure that

545
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,159
it's up to date

546
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,840
and also just keep on remembering

547
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,039
that you know if a tool is added or

548
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,400
removed that should be updated in your

549
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,640
incident response plan if there's a team

550
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,159
member change that should be updating

551
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,240
your incident response plan if there's

552
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,679
environment change such as everyone's

553
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,360
working from home now that needs to be

554
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,440
updating your incident response plan

555
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,200
it's so important that we have solid

556
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,280
plans because this does reduce the

557
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,840
stress of when a breach occurs that we

558
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,559
have a game plan in a sense

559
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,720
you owe it to yourselves you owe it to

560
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,320
your team your colleagues your

561
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,360
organization even your customers

562
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,039
now the one thing i want to also say is

563
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,280
that you also do have to practice

564
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,039
certain self-care which is if you're

565
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,799
starting to feel burned out it's time to

566
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,080
take time off that means

567
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,240
take time off that means

568
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,000
not being on social media that means

569
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,840
getting off of your computer your

570
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,080
devices that means taking a whole week

571
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,760
off because studies have shown if you

572
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,679
want to deal with burnout and get rid of

573
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,360
burnout take a whole week off

574
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,159
and

575
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,640
don't do anything work related it's

576
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,400
really important that's the only way

577
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,960
that you can recover believe it or not

578
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,440
is to do that and to make changes in

579
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,320
your workplace or your home life so just

580
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,400
keep that in mind

581
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,159
and i know that it's

582
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,799
very scary to take time off because

583
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,799
sometimes we're afraid if we take time

584
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,559
off that our teammates are going to have

585
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,400
to pick up our work or we're going to be

586
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,480
afraid that we're going to be coming

587
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,720
back to a dumpster fire so it's really

588
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,200
important to understand is

589
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,120
we need to take time off regardless

590
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,760
because even if you are not taking time

591
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,600
off and you're burned out chances are

592
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,640
you're going to impact someone else

593
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
or some other team or some other

594
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,440
organization because you're not able to

595
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,679
properly do what you can do if you

596
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,360
weren't burned out

597
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
now the other thing to keep in mind is

598
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
that this also means reducing your

599
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,240
meetings if you have meetings have one

600
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,200
day off a week for meetings

601
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,480
so then we can play catch up in a sense

602
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
now the other thing i would say is

603
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,240
investment number four is have a

604
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,080
vulnerability disclosure

605
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,640
policies and have or

606
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,559
an or okay and or a bug bounty program

607
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,360
i mean it if you are if you care about

608
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,679
your security at your organization

609
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,799
have one

610
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,919
but also not just have one but also make

611
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,880
sure that it is managed well and what i

612
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,640
mean by that is

613
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
having effective communications between

614
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,159
the hackers that are submitting the bugs

615
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,480
and your organization's response it is

616
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
so important that we have better

617
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,039
communication across the parties because

618
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,200
that's one of the reasons why

619
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
it can be very stressful to participate

620
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
so it's really important is to just make

621
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,799
sure that it's managed well have it

622
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,120
really structured well

623
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,880
and really

624
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,039
really try your best and get feedback

625
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,200
from the hacker so say like how can we

626
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,880
do better next time

627
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
ask them they love to respond and tell

628
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,960
you about that and also

629
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,159
hackers

630
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,480
feel free to reach out to them and ask

631
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,279
them

632
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,080
how can i do better next time how can i

633
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,039
improve my communication or how can i do

634
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,400
better and i think that's the one thing

635
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,720
that we can always do is just ask how

636
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,840
can i do better

637
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,279
now i want to just take this moment here

638
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,919
to just talk really quick on this one

639
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,320
investment number five is be kind and

640
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,439
respect boundaries

641
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,520
we have to just understand delays and

642
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,919
expectations are in conflict all the

643
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,400
time in bug bounty world and also when

644
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,799
we're reporting vulnerabilities but it's

645
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,720
really really important is to understand

646
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
to be kind to one another because we

647
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,880
don't know what the other person's going

648
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,919
through

649
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,520
and it's really important that we need

650
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
to start practicing empathy a little bit

651
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,159
more is to try to understand what their

652
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,159
situation is like so we can understand

653
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,360
one another

654
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,679
because by having empathy this also

655
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,000
helps reduce our stress but also this

656
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
allows us to

657
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,400
you know in the end kind of reduce that

658
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,039
burnout here and there or reduce the

659
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,200
possibility of getting burned out

660
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,080
and what i mean by is like

661
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,039
when it comes to submitting bugs

662
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,080
and you're waiting to hear back

663
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,799
please don't harass them

664
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,200
what i mean by that is don't contact

665
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,440
them on their social media that means

666
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
don't dm them on their twitter or

667
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,440
linkedin or their facebook or instagram

668
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,919
what i mean by that is understand that

669
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,520
it is their job and they don't work 24 7

670
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
around the clock they have

671
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,080
boundaries they work between nine to

672
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,200
five

673
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,440
in a certain time zone and that the

674
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
weekends they don't want to work

675
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,720
and it's really understanding to

676
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,480
understand this whole situation is

677
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,840
please respect boundaries

678
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
it is their job but they also have a

679
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,720
personal life outside of work and

680
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,320
respect that

681
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,039
so

682
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,679
when you do have communication with them

683
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
what you can do is ask

684
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,440
when should i follow up

685
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,200
and i like this question quite a bit

686
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
because when they ask me that question

687
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,679
when should i follow up

688
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,440
i can give them an idea of like

689
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,120
reach out in two weeks or reach out

690
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,440
within seven days

691
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,520
and this really helps the conversation

692
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,279
because then you just mark it in your

693
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,720
calendar and then you

694
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,320
write back to them on that day if you

695
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,120
haven't heard back or an update

696
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,240
other thing is that if you are um

697
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
basically following up with a hacker

698
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,400
that has submitted a vulnerability

699
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
it's important to understand that for

700
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,919
some bug bounty and hunting

701
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,240
is their income

702
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,960
so

703
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,279
please understand if they're like hey i

704
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,600
haven't been paid out yet

705
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,080
understand that to them getting paid is

706
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,520
really important

707
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,559
because for some is their main income

708
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,559
and also it doesn't matter the thing is

709
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,960
if they've paid and you've accepted this

710
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
bug

711
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,640
they they need to get paid out um the

712
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,720
other thing to keep in mind is that

713
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,679
language and culture does play a role

714
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,440
we're all around the world we're all

715
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,480
different

716
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,880
so it's important to be kind in your

717
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,320
responses

718
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,399
but also

719
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,520
be as transparent as possible but also

720
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,080
to provide a time frame for them this

721
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,919
also helps with you when they try to

722
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,000
come back and to follow up with some

723
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,480
updates

724
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,000
so here's a quick slide of what you can

725
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,679
do right now to reduce burnout

726
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,880
is have set 101s for 15 minutes with

727
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,279
each employee if you're on a team make

728
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,159
money or fridays a no meeting day set up

729
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,919
a meeting with your team to explore ways

730
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,080
on how you can improve together you can

731
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,679
always create anonymous survey to find

732
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,320
out what is going on and how the company

733
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,840
can do better but please note not

734
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,200
everyone's going to participate and

735
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,760
don't enforce it but also

736
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,520
have vulnerability disclosure policies

737
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,000
and someone who can manage the incoming

738
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,799
at the same time

739
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,320
and last

740
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,240
remember when we work together and

741
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,480
listen to each other magic does happen

742
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,159
and when we work together making sure

743
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,559
people get personal time off without the

744
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,120
fear and take time away we then become

745
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,679
collaborative but also acknowledging

746
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,919
that when we collaborate we also reduce

747
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,520
the stressful items that hold us back

748
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,240
from our team from thriving and focusing

749
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,840
on that balancing of work and personal

750
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,720
life is something very important for

751
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,240
everyone and we just support that

752
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,159
and also

753
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,760
we need to work with the hacker

754
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
community bug bounty programs voluntary

755
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
disclosure policies are incredibly

756
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,960
important for reducing the stress on

757
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,600
your teammates because sometimes we need

758
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,159
a little bit of help outside our

759
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,480
security team

760
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,279
so overview right now does place you and

761
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,679
your team at a huge risk collaborate to

762
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,919
form strategies to improve the team

763
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,399
start making plans and revisit security

764
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,200
response plans and promote self-care by

765
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,320
being kind and respectful to boundaries

766
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,480
and also take some breaks that's the

767
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,760
only way you're going to heal from

768
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,120
burnout

769
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,039
i just want to say thank you all so much

770
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,919
for existing thank you for having me it

771
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,840
is a pleasure to be here if you have any

772
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,640
questions at all feel free to ask

773
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,480
but until then

774
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,080
keep on hunting and i

775
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,960
yeah and please stay safe

776
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,760
bye
