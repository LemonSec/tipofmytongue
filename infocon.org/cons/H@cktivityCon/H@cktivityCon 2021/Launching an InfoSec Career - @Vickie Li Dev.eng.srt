00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,000
hello and welcome to activity con

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
my name is vicky and in this session i'm

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,199
going to be talking about how to launch

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,480
an infosec career as a student or as

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
someone who is just starting out in the

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,680
field

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,000
i know it's very very difficult to

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,240
launch a career in any field and

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,040
especially in infosec

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,600
where a lot of the times there is no

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,879
clear-cut path to help you get started

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
and there are so many different

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
directions that you can take

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,160
and every path sort of requires a

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,960
slightly different skill set it could be

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,680
really confusing and

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,160
can feel like a maze sometimes

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,719
so how do you manage all of that and

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
launch your own career in infosec

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,559
so today i'm here to share with you some

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,360
of my experience getting started as well

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,439
as some of the things i learned along

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,640
the way that i hope will help you start

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,880
your career too

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,080
so before we get started hey my name is

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,400
vikki and it's great to be with you here

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,439
today

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,920
i am a developer and a hacker and i

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,000
currently work at an application

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,479
security company called shift left as

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
their developer evangelist

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,439
i also authored a book called the bug

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,240
bounty boot camp that aims at helping

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,280
beginners get started in bug bounties

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
you can find me on twitter at wikilea7

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
so one of the questions that i get the

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,560
most online is

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,640
you know vicki how do i get started in

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,159
cyber security

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,720
and when someone asks me this question

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
i often have a hard time answering them

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,119
because the truth is that there's really

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,840
no singular or best way

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,439
to help you get started in cyber

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,399
security and it would all depend on what

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,320
you like you know what your preferences

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,119
are

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,000
what are your credentials do you have a

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,720
degree as well as what other skills you

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,680
have

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,239
but there are things that are helpful to

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,640
know for anyone who wants to go into

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
infosec and that's what we'll be

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
focusing on in this talk

56
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,680
so today i want to share my experience

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
with you as well as

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
some of the lessons that i've learned

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,720
along the way that would help me

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,680
navigate the process

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,319
so a little bit about my background

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,680
first

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,080
i didn't really start out wanting to go

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,840
into infosec i went to college for

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,160
computer science and got a bachelor's in

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,760
computer science

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,920
i thought i wanted to become a software

68
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,239
engineer so at first i actually wanted

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,840
to build software instead of breaking it

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
and i took a lot of computer systems

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,440
courses and got introduced to cyber

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,000
security that way like in computer

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,599
systems

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,080
101 i remember learning about buffer

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,319
overflows and thought that they were

76
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,640
really really cool

77
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,480
and then i discovered bug bounties

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
so as a college student it was a truly

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,000
amazing experience right prior to bug

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
bounties i was interested in cyber

81
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
security too but

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,280
i used bug bounties as a way to learn

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
more about security

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
and it was really really cool to be able

85
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,159
to start earning money when i was

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,000
just a student and just starting to

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,959
learn about the field

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,920
but as i you know as i hunted for bugs

89
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
and as i sat in front of my burp suite

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,040
window

91
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,159
i started to lose my motivation for

92
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,360
hunting because i really wanted

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,799
my work to

94
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,200
help me connect with other people

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,400
and bug bounty hunting by myself was not

96
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
really doing that and was making me a

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
little lonely

98
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,959
so that's why i started my technical

99
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
blog where i started to

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
write about whatever i was learning at

101
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
the moment

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,440
and i really really tried like one of

103
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,560
the focuses that i did at the start was

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,240
that i tried to

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
make the blog post really easy to

106
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
understand

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
partially because that was whatever i

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,520
was learning right i was trying to

109
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
reinforce my own learning and review

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,960
what i learned

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,759
but another thing is that i hoped

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
people who were studying the same thing

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
as me

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
would find it helpful and then reach out

115
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
to me and then hopefully i'll make some

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,240
friends in cyber security that way

117
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,639
but little did i know my technical blog

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,960
was the thing that really kick-started

119
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,520
my career in infosec

120
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
so because on my blog i was able to get

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,600
some freelance pen testing opportunities

122
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
i also got

123
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
some technical writing freelance

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
contracts

125
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
and i started to get invited to speak at

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,039
different conferences

127
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,800
and that

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
blog also led me to start writing

129
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,120
bug bounty boot camp and led me to start

130
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
a youtube channel teaching about

131
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,520
security because i also want to teach

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,639
people who

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,720
don't prefer reading as a learning

134
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,759
method

135
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,800
right and eventually the blog also

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,520
landed me my current job at shift left

137
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,199
yeah so as i said

138
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,120
when i started my blog i never really

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,280
thought that it would become such a

140
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320
central point in my life right now right

141
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,199
and

142
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,120
what i thought would happen after

143
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
college is that

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
my computer science degree would lead to

145
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,039
a software engineering job and i will be

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,440
a software engineer for my whole life

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
and that didn't really

148
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,639
work out

149
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,840
what ended up actually happening was

150
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
more like this

151
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,000
where my side hobby which is bug

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,560
bounties led me to explore many

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
different things in the security

154
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
industry and led me to explore

155
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,840
different areas

156
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,039
of

157
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,880
things outside of security as well like

158
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,360
writing speaking and so on and it

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,680
eventually led me to where i am right

160
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,880
now

161
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,680
so here are a few things i learned while

162
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,319
navigating this kind of messy first few

163
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,600
years of my career in infosec

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
so the first lesson i learned

165
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,400
is that there is more to infosec than

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,440
hacking

167
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,919
so before uh starting to work actually

168
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
work in the field i thought that the

169
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,759
majority of people who work in infosec

170
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
are either penetration testers or

171
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
hackers they all work in

172
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,639
breaking into system in some shape or

173
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,680
form

174
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,080
but the reality is that infosec is

175
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
really a very very diverse field and

176
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,039
there are a lot of roles a lot of things

177
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,680
you can try as well as a lot of

178
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,880
specializations that you can focus on

179
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
for instance you can do application

180
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,319
security where

181
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,400
you help a company develop secure

182
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
applications or you can become a

183
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
developer who knows how to build secure

184
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,199
software

185
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,520
or you can go into penetration testing

186
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,080
and break into systems as well

187
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,360
or you can go into digital forensics and

188
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,440
incident response that's also a really

189
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,599
big field and

190
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,919
where you investigate security incidents

191
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,880
and respond and protect a company after

192
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,759
a security incident has happened

193
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,639
you can also go into cloud security

194
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,720
secure software design

195
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,120
operational security security education

196
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,039
and so on so on

197
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,080
so hacking and penetration testing

198
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,720
they are the most well known job titles

199
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,639
but there are so many things to do in

200
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,560
infosec and so many different types of

201
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
people in infosec so if you don't think

202
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,680
that hacking is right for you

203
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,840
don't feel discouraged there might still

204
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,639
be a place for you in the industry

205
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,960
like i started out doing bug bounties

206
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
right and then i realized that doing bug

207
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,400
bounties full time or all alone is not

208
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
really suitable for me and that's why i

209
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,440
pivoted and started to explore different

210
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
things in the industry

211
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
so before stepping into

212
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,160
um like committing yourself into one

213
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,399
field of infosec or one expertise in

214
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,519
infosec

215
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,000
really try to explore yourself

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,559
to the different areas of the industry

217
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,559
and the field to try to find something

218
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,799
that suits you

219
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,120
um you might find something that you

220
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
have not even tried or even heard of

221
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,480
that ends up being a really good fit for

222
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,120
you and aligns with what you want in a

223
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,480
career right

224
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
so a good resource that you can use to

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,519
discover more about the industry is a

226
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,519
podcast that i host

227
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,600
called sources and syncs

228
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,839
so in this podcast i interview a lot of

229
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,839
people with really interesting careers

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,800
like i talked with someone who works in

231
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
security education

232
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
she educates corporate employees about

233
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,399
how to be more secure

234
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,200
i also talk to someone who is a hacker

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,240
youtuber and a penetration tester and i

236
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
also talked with someone

237
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
who works with iot hacking he's an iot

238
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,440
penetration tester and so on

239
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
so

240
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
there's a lot of things to learn about

241
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
and there's no need to lock yourself

242
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,959
into

243
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,040
one career that you think suits the um

244
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
the stereotype of infosec

245
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
and also

246
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
so another way to explore different

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,399
careers in infosec is that if you use

248
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,360
twitter often you can ask about people's

249
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,680
jobs on there and you'll probably find

250
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,560
that

251
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,040
infosec folks do a lot of different

252
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,360
things in different domains in infosec

253
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
and everyone has a slightly different or

254
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,399
drastically different job function and

255
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,920
could be really interesting to hear

256
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,560
about what people do

257
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,600
and then

258
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
so after you figure out what kind of

259
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
specialty might suit you you can start

260
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
to research and learn the skills that

261
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,120
you need specifically for that specialty

262
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,519
in infosec so if you want to become a

263
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,839
security focused developer you might

264
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,800
want to study up on the os top 10

265
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,880
vulnerabilities and how to prevent them

266
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
and so on and if you want to become a

267
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,079
security analyst who protects a

268
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,160
corporate network you probably need to

269
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
understand networking and bash scripting

270
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
right and finally if you want to go into

271
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,720
penetration testing

272
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,800
you should learn about reconnaissance

273
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,839
how to exploit common vulnerabilities as

274
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,160
well as how to explain

275
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,480
technical issues in writing these are

276
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,120
all good skills to have

277
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,399
but the skills that you need to have is

278
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,640
very very dependent on the specialty you

279
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,600
choose

280
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,320
so it's good to have some idea of what

281
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
direction you want to go before you

282
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,519
actually jump into teaching yourself

283
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,200
and the next thing that i like to add is

284
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,360
that after you've determined your

285
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,000
direction and you're looking for jobs

286
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
don't just go after a single job title

287
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,920
when you're looking for jobs

288
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,800
and because in infosec specifically the

289
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,120
same role can mean very very different

290
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,839
things in different organizations or

291
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
even different teams in the same

292
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,399
organization for instance

293
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,519
and a security and analyst in a bug

294
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,839
bounty platform company can mean that

295
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
you're triaging reports for a client

296
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,880
company

297
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,079
whereas security analysts in another

298
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,200
organization you could be analyzing logs

299
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
all day

300
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
so when you're looking for your first

301
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,320
job

302
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
don't just rely on the job title to make

303
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,600
your decisions you should instead search

304
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
for the type of work that you want to be

305
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,079
doing and base your decision on that

306
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,360
instead

307
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,839
so for instance if you see an ad for a

308
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,040
pen testing job try to figure out what

309
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
type of pen testing they expect you to

310
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,839
do

311
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,320
is it a third party pen testing firm

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,160
where you'll be testing many many

313
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,399
different products throughout your work

314
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,360
life

315
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
or will you be an in-house pen tester

316
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839
focused on just that one product

317
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,760
and you should also figure out things

318
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,920
like how big is the team

319
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
how much time would you be spending on a

320
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,639
target and how much time

321
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,680
would be

322
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
active hacking versus

323
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
doing presentations

324
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,399
writing reports or doing

325
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
other tasks you know all of these

326
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,000
factors would make each pen testing job

327
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,639
a very different work experience

328
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,320
so you definitely need to take these

329
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,680
into account

330
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,959
because it may or may not suit what you

331
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,600
want in the career

332
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,760
and then the next step is sort of figure

333
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
out in detail what the day-to-day of a

334
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,760
job actually looks like

335
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
and then you should communicate with

336
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
your hiring manager

337
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
or other people in the organization

338
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,519
about your expectations on the job as

339
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,480
well

340
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,600
do you like a more dynamic environment

341
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,560
and work on a variety of things or do

342
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,360
you prefer being a specialist and only

343
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
focus on a few technical tasks so

344
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,000
infosec careers are also very diverse in

345
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,959
that way that you can have a variety of

346
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279
work environments and you really want to

347
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,760
look into that as well as the technical

348
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
aspects of the work too

349
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,760
so the next tip is that i talked about

350
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,199
teaching yourself the skills that you

351
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,920
need for a job right but how exactly do

352
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,440
you do that

353
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,079
so in information security it's really

354
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,720
really really important to teach to know

355
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,160
how to teach yourself

356
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,480
and i even say that it's probably the

357
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
most important skill that you need to

358
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,480
master if you want to be successful in

359
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,680
the field

360
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,199
so first of all

361
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,040
teaching yourself is important because

362
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,680
if you want a viewer student and you're

363
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,120
looking to become a security

364
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,279
professional then knowing how to treat

365
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,279
yourself is really useful

366
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,360
when you don't have access to a mentor

367
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,760
or an official degree program that can

368
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
train you for that job

369
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,000
and because the field is also constantly

370
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,320
changing it's really important that you

371
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,720
master the skills of teaching yourself

372
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,440
new things so that you can upgrade your

373
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,199
skill set throughout your professional

374
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,000
life

375
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,240
even after you successfully launch a

376
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
career in the field

377
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,480
so let's say that you are trying to

378
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
self-study to become a penetration

379
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
tester

380
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
the first step to teaching yourself

381
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,680
should be identifying the skills that

382
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,639
you need to have that career

383
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,920
so a good way to do this is to look at

384
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,320
what the syllabus or you know what the

385
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,160
degree program looks like for the topic

386
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,000
that you want to learn

387
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,320
for example if you want to

388
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,240
learn programming but you are not sure

389
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
where to start

390
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,240
find out what courses first your

391
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,079
computer science students in colleges

392
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,680
learn and try to teach that to yourself

393
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,600
and for careers that

394
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,199
don't have

395
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,399
many college degrees aimed towards it

396
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
like penetration testing and incidence

397
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,079
response you can go and look at popular

398
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,959
online courses and books

399
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,920
or online guides or roadmaps to

400
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
determine the major skill sets that you

401
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,279
need to have that career

402
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,519
and after you identify the skills that

403
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,040
you need always create a plan of how you

404
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
are going to teach that skill set to

405
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,839
yourself

406
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,920
you need to plan out

407
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,360
what are the topics that you need to

408
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,519
learn whether the subtopics that you

409
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,079
need to master in order to master that

410
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,519
major topic

411
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,399
as well as how to teach yourself these

412
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,040
topics and in what order

413
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,920
right so start by determining

414
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,600
start by determining

415
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,759
the major topics that you need to know

416
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,680
as well as the skills that you need to

417
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,480
know

418
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,160
and then break these topics down

419
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,320
to subtopics by doing some research if

420
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,399
you're learning about reconnaissance for

421
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,120
instance you might break it down into

422
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
active recon techniques and passive

423
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
recon techniques

424
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,120
or you can also classify recon

425
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,040
techniques by its objective like uh you

426
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,519
can break it down by techniques for host

427
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,800
discovery

428
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
techniques for

429
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,560
subdomain enumeration

430
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,160
techniques for

431
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,959
discovering files on the machine and so

432
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,440
on right you need to

433
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,680
break down these big topics and these

434
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,720
big skill sets into smaller ones so that

435
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,880
you can teach themselves they can you

436
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,759
can teach them to yourselves one by one

437
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,799
and then

438
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,439
you could start making a learning plan

439
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,480
by starting with the topic that requires

440
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,039
the least amount of knowledge about that

441
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,280
subject matters and you should start

442
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,119
teaching yourself there

443
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,359
and then you can proceed to learn about

444
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,679
things that build on top of that

445
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,919
knowledge that you've already learned

446
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,559
so let's say that you're learning

447
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
recon and you're learning subdomain

448
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,880
enumeration techniques

449
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
you can start with simple techniques

450
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,440
like brute forcing and with with a

451
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,160
simple word list you find online

452
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,919
and then you can

453
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,240
next thing you can learn about is how to

454
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,080
brew four subdomains using permutations

455
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
and then finally you can go on to learn

456
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,520
about dns techniques once you understand

457
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,000
sort of how subdomain enumeration works

458
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,280
how

459
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,520
dns system works as well as

460
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
after you gain sort of proficiency with

461
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,960
the easier techniques

462
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
and when you jump into learning

463
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
something on the internet i have to say

464
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,760
this is that you have to be aware of the

465
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,840
resources that you use

466
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,640
so anyone can really post anything on

467
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
the internet and the people who teach

468
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
other people online

469
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
you know like me for instance we can

470
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,080
make mistakes too

471
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,919
so instead of relying on one resource as

472
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,320
your only source of information

473
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,799
you should really really try to verify

474
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,799
your knowledge by using multiple

475
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,520
different versions of the same resource

476
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,600
this is really really important to make

477
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,760
sure that you don't learn the wrong

478
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,720
thing or you don't just get

479
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,240
a limited view on a certain topic

480
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,840
for instance let's say that you are

481
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
learning about server-side request

482
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,240
forgeries or ssrfs

483
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,720
you can see what different blog posts

484
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,360
online say about ssrfs

485
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
they might talk about different things

486
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,919
or

487
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
discuss the topic in many different ways

488
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,200
and they might have different insights

489
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,160
and tips and tricks about the same topic

490
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,559
and you know one post might get

491
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,320
something wrong and you wouldn't know

492
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
unless you take in another person's

493
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,320
perspective so always use more than one

494
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,039
source of information and never trust a

495
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,600
resource completely when you are using

496
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,559
the internet as a learning resource

497
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,720
and you shouldn't be relying on one

498
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,039
resource anyway because

499
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,320
on the internet

500
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,880
any blog post or any resource it's

501
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,039
typically just a few clicks away right

502
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,840
so take advantage of that diversity of

503
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,320
voices on the internet to really expand

504
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,280
your horizons

505
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,840
and then final tip about teaching

506
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,320
yourself is that you should track your

507
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,280
progress by routinely testing yourself

508
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,760
so because you are executing your own

509
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,320
learning plan you're essentially

510
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,720
working as your own teacher right and

511
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
you need to make sure that you are

512
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
actually on track and

513
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
actually learning what you should be

514
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,960
learning you yourself are responsible

515
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,080
with that

516
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,640
and reading about a topic versus

517
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
actually retaining the knowledge are

518
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,000
often very to two very different things

519
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
and you want to make sure that you've

520
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,039
not only read about the topic and

521
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,720
sort of learn about the topic you also

522
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
want to make sure that you actually

523
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,120
internalized it and you can retain it

524
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,400
and use it in your future pursuits right

525
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,039
so there are a lot of ways to test your

526
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,640
knowledge it really depends on your

527
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
preference but one of the things i

528
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,039
really like to do is that i like to

529
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,120
write down everything i know about a

530
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,760
topic and then i go back and reference

531
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,120
my notes to see if i miss anything or i

532
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,039
got anything wrong

533
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,200
kind of like you know you're writing an

534
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,320
essay about a topic talking about

535
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,960
all this all its nuances

536
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,120
so for instance if you are learning

537
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,600
about defending against sql injections

538
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,440
you can try to write down every defense

539
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,559
you know against sql injections like oh

540
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,320
um

541
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,120
parameterization

542
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,320
escaping sanitization and so on and then

543
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,360
you would explain their differences

544
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,880
what is parametrization what is escaping

545
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,159
and then

546
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,000
also you should write down what kind of

547
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
context you should use each defense and

548
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
so on because these are all important

549
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,440
aspects of the topic

550
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,080
and then afterwards go back to your

551
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,799
learning notes and see if you missed

552
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,200
anything or if you're understanding on

553
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
one of the techniques is not quite

554
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,919
complete or is wrong and then correct

555
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,679
your understanding from there and then

556
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,520
test yourself again afterwards

557
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,640
so on to the next lesson

558
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,280
the next thing i learned in infosec is

559
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,799
that the people you know can help you

560
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,360
and the easiest way to get your foot in

561
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,679
the door is really through the people

562
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,600
you know

563
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,880
like i got my first web development job

564
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,200
and my first internship

565
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,080
through the people i met at university

566
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,039
or online i got my first web development

567
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,760
job through a university professor and i

568
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,559
got my first internship through someone

569
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,080
i met online

570
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,440
so um and an infosight is the exact same

571
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
way networking is very very important

572
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,240
and there are there are ways to build

573
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,400
this connections there are different

574
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,480
ways to build this connection right like

575
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,640
if you are currently in college you can

576
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,120
build your connections that way but

577
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,799
there are many many different ways to

578
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,280
build these connections even if you

579
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,480
don't already

580
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
you aren't already enrolled in college

581
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,640
or if you don't already have friends and

582
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
family who work in the infosec

583
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,559
and the easiest way to do that is

584
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,480
through the internet

585
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
for instance you can jump on social

586
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,280
media like twitter and interact with the

587
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,360
infosec folks there

588
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,880
and or you can also take online courses

589
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,200
and meet the instructor and then maybe

590
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,919
that will lead to more opportunities

591
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,960
or you can participate in online ctfs

592
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,280
with remote teams or

593
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
answer questions on hacking forms like

594
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,960
reddit

595
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,840
and so these are all great ways that you

596
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,480
might meet people with who will offer

597
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,360
you opportunities or guidance

598
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
friendship or even just someone to

599
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,280
discuss what you're learning at the

600
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,000
moment with

601
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,039
so another very effective way of meeting

602
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,360
people is to participate in events

603
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,600
physical events especially

604
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,679
are great for this because

605
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,760
most of the time you'll be with the same

606
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,080
group of people for a long time

607
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,840
and you'll have common topics to talk

608
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,400
about right and people will be more open

609
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,360
to conversations with complete strangers

610
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,679
during events because they sort of think

611
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,080
that you're one of them whereas if you

612
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,120
approach just some random infosec guy on

613
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,799
the street and he probably won't talk to

614
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,919
you right

615
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,960
so attending uh physical events are

616
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,279
probably one of the best ways to build

617
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,360
lasting connections in the industry

618
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
because you're not just interacting in

619
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,679
in the superficial way you're sort of

620
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,679
building a friendship as well you're

621
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,760
talking to people casually you're

622
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,440
talking shop to people you're talking

623
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,279
about technical things you're going out

624
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,440
to dinner you're going to coughing so

625
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,159
i'm a great great proponent of

626
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,400
going to a physical event if you can

627
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,159
afford it

628
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,559
but yeah attending physical events can

629
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,039
be very expensive right there are you

630
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,240
know conference fees hotel fees airfares

631
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
for some people there might be visa fees

632
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,159
if you're going abroad

633
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,440
so um it's not always available to

634
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,400
everyone

635
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,480
but there are sometimes ways that you

636
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,000
can get around that

637
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,080
especially if you're a student you might

638
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,240
be able to apply for scholarships for

639
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,600
instance or get sponsored by companies

640
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,679
or get sponsored by your college to

641
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,799
attend these events

642
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,200
i actually attended my first devcon

643
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
using a google conference scholarship

644
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
program

645
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,279
and i attended my first technical my

646
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,480
very first infosight conference northsec

647
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,520
um via a scholarship that my university

648
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,799
provided

649
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,080
so there are many scholarships available

650
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,679
to students who want to get into

651
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,799
security

652
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,720
like the grace hopper conference offers

653
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,120
scholarships for female students

654
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,919
and

655
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,080
google's conference scholarship is open

656
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,360
to anyone who identify as

657
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,520
an underrepresented minority in infosec

658
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,799
so that's the one that i really

659
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
recommend a google conference

660
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,480
scholarship it's very easy to apply for

661
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,320
and they cover everything

662
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,840
that you need for a conference they

663
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,159
cover all the expenses

664
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,480
and it's it's amazing and they even

665
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
invite you to private rooms once you're

666
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,960
in the event to sort of socialize with

667
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,039
google engineers

668
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,360
and you know many other conferences they

669
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,279
also have individual scholarships that

670
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,400
you can apply for and many times they

671
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,880
might even just give you a free ticket

672
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,960
or a discounted ticket as long as you're

673
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,360
a student you never know um and it never

674
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,080
hurts to ask

675
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,799
but still even with all these uh

676
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,120
scholarships available i know that not

677
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,600
everyone has the privilege and the time

678
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,880
and the resources to actually

679
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,200
participate in physical events

680
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,600
right so in that case virtual events can

681
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
actually bring you very similar benefits

682
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,159
if you're willing to develop your time

683
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,480
and your energy into actively

684
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,120
reaching out to people during the event

685
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,039
so for virtual events right there are

686
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,320
many ways

687
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,400
and there are many different levels that

688
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
you can participate

689
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
and so

690
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,440
you can just listen to the talks like

691
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,400
everyone

692
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,039
or you can actively message other

693
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,200
attendees and be an active person

694
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,840
participant in these events you can ask

695
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,480
questions to the speakers during q a

696
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,200
you can chat with the organizers and you

697
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,960
know sort of ask them about different

698
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,799
infosight topics

699
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,080
so these are all great ways to

700
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,240
actively participate in

701
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,120
a conference right it's not just

702
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,799
listening to the talks and learning

703
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,039
something from it you can actually

704
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,840
participate actively to get the most out

705
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,240
of virtual events

706
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,720
and a lot of events that are

707
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
physical only before the pandemic are

708
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
actually becoming virtual right now due

709
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,919
to the lockdown so if you want to attend

710
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,840
virtual events there's never been a

711
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,760
better time right you actually have a

712
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,159
lot more options right now like defcon

713
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,520
this year was hybrid and uh so

714
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
for the first time ever a lot of people

715
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,720
was able to

716
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,840
attend defcon and a lot of events like

717
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,960
that are going virtual or hybrid so take

718
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,159
this opportunity to explore a lot of the

719
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,960
traditionally physical conferences and

720
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,080
you know see if you like them

721
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,960
and so a final tip for meeting people is

722
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,919
that

723
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,760
you know who should you reach out to if

724
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,880
you want to get guidance or job in your

725
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
chosen expertise

726
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,240
and the answer is that instead of

727
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,720
reaching out to recruiters or just

728
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
anyone who works in the same field or

729
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,640
the same company you should really try

730
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,399
to talk to the people who already have

731
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,480
your dream job instead

732
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,880
so if you want to be a pen tester talk

733
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,120
to pen testers instead of bug bounty

734
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,840
hunters or incident response people

735
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,679
and if you want to go into secure

736
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,679
development try to talk to some

737
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,679
experienced developers or the security

738
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,840
champions at their company

739
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,120
because infosec is super diverse and

740
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,360
an infosec person in a different

741
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,360
specialty might have no idea

742
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,279
about what you're trying to learn if

743
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,240
it's not their area of expertise for

744
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,960
instance uh if you want to go into iot

745
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,039
security i probably couldn't help you

746
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,120
because that's not my level uh that's

747
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,080
not not my area of expertise so you get

748
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,480
a lot better guidance on exactly what

749
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,600
skills you need as well as

750
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,000
what working the the job on the

751
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,240
day-to-day actually feels like if you

752
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,799
talk to and find the right people

753
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,159
so that brings us to tip number four

754
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,720
so just like how people are meeting

755
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,320
people are changing

756
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,799
how people are getting jobs are also

757
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,840
changing and you should understand that

758
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,240
now your online presence

759
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,559
functions as your resume

760
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,240
and it's something that people will look

761
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,679
at the first thing when they are

762
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,320
considering working with you

763
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,919
so try to have

764
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,159
some form of online presence for your

765
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,840
professional life

766
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,080
even if you don't use social media in

767
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,320
your personal life try to have like a

768
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
profile that showcases your professional

769
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,880
history this can be something like

770
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,679
linkedin profile a twitter profile

771
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,039
or even

772
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,240
a facebook profile or a personal website

773
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,159
that really lists

774
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,320
what you can do and where you've been in

775
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,559
your life for instance you went to

776
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,200
you know technical college and then you

777
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,120
got a graduate degree

778
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,000
and you had an internship in so-and-so

779
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,720
company you really really want to make

780
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,520
this visible to strangers and you want

781
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,480
to make this visible to anyone who might

782
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,960
search for you online

783
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
and then you should also link your

784
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,760
professional profile to a portfolio that

785
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,000
showcases your abilities

786
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,399
and you can do this really whatever you

787
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,559
like however you like and a portfolio

788
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,960
can mean a lot of different things right

789
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,799
for instance it could be a technical

790
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,880
blog where you talk about the bugs you

791
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,159
found

792
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,640
or it could be a technical youtube

793
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,960
channel where you explain

794
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,080
application security best practices

795
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,679
or it could be a github profile with

796
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,559
security related projects and so on it

797
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,120
could also be a bug bounty profile with

798
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,360
a few disclosed bugs

799
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,760
the goal is to really have a reliable

800
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,840
way of showing what you can do

801
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,360
professionally like going back to the

802
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,200
um online profile point that i made

803
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,240
is that those really just

804
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,519
outline

805
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,399
the

806
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,640
very rough sketch of what your

807
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,799
professional history looks like your

808
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,120
portfolio can tell the employers in

809
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,720
detail what you can actually do and so

810
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,559
if you were a penetration tester in the

811
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,880
past what kind of penetration testing

812
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,720
did you do right um are you more of a

813
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,360
cloud person are you a web person are

814
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,080
you a social engineering person

815
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,799
your portfolio can tell the employers

816
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,640
that

817
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,360
and you can it's also a way to showcase

818
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,760
sort of your non-technical skills as

819
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,559
well like writing a blog post

820
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,799
also shows that you're capable of

821
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,120
writing well and you can express your

822
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,200
thoughts through writing well and that's

823
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
a very valuable skill and a lot of

824
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,519
infosight careers

825
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,840
and having a youtube channel shows that

826
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,399
you can present well and that's also a

827
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,720
really really valuable skill in any

828
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,159
industry

829
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,000
so i actually know a lot of people who

830
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,760
got their jobs or their freelance

831
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,480
contracts because of a youtube channel

832
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
or their technical blogs so these are

833
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,960
great ways to prove the skills that you

834
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,679
actually have

835
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,039
so another thing i realized is that

836
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,679
getting a job in infosec or succeeding

837
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,519
in your infosight career

838
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,000
is not always about becoming the

839
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,120
absolute best in the narrow

840
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,279
narrow era of narrow field of expertise

841
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,240
so instead of choosing a single

842
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,480
technical skill and only studying that

843
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,840
skill if you can also find a combination

844
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,000
of skills that make you unique you can

845
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,320
have a good career as well

846
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,720
so you don't always need to be a

847
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
specialist you can

848
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
be

849
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,840
very good at certain combinations of

850
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,440
skills and that could also make you

851
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,720
successful

852
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
for example if you have

853
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,279
bug bounty hunting skills you can become

854
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,320
a bug bounty hunter but if you also have

855
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,559
good communication skills

856
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,159
in addition to backbone accounting

857
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,480
skills you could become a bug bounty

858
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,000
triager or maybe a pen tester as well

859
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,480
and if you understand also how to write

860
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,440
good code that prevents vulnerabilities

861
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,279
then you could become a very good

862
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,519
developer who is security con who is

863
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,240
security conscious and is capable of

864
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
handling the bug boundary reports that

865
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,399
are sent to your application

866
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,560
so each unique

867
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,359
skill combination that you have can open

868
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,040
up a lot of new opportunities for you

869
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,918
like at my job at shift left right now

870
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,399
i have to rely a lot on my technical

871
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,199
skills and knowledge that i gained as a

872
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,359
penetration tester because i need to

873
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,918
know about security best practices as

874
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,560
well as security vulnerabilities

875
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,960
but i also do a lot of writing and

876
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,520
speaking so those are essential skills

877
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,079
for my roles as well and someone who

878
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,399
only has penetration testing skills but

879
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,480
cannot write well or speak at

880
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,719
conferences cannot have my job for

881
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,280
instance so this applies to a lot of

882
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,079
roles in the infosec industry is that we

883
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,719
need people who possesses a combination

884
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,159
of skills instead of a master of a

885
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,359
single skill

886
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,839
and those skills are not always limited

887
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,880
to infosec either things like writing

888
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,800
presenting

889
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,440
project management skills and marketing

890
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,160
these are all very very useful skills to

891
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,240
have that will add to your value if

892
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,320
you're trying to launch a career in

893
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,640
infosec and they can even bring your

894
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,960
career into directions that you did not

895
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,079
expect for instance um a lot of people

896
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,800
who go into technical writing did not

897
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,320
know that uh

898
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
they wanted to go to technical writing

899
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,240
and then eventually they ended up really

900
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,359
enjoying it and a lot of my friends who

901
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,599
are security influencers security

902
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,800
youtubers

903
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,040
they were just started out wanting to

904
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
share their knowledge right and they

905
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,040
eventually ended up launching a career

906
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,800
doing just that doing youtube videos or

907
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,640
teaching about security online

908
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,040
and then finally the last point that i

909
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,839
like to touch on is about getting

910
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,240
experience a lot of infosec jobs out

911
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,839
there are asking you for experience

912
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,560
but how do you actually you know get

913
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,960
these experience when every job or every

914
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,440
internship opportunity asks that you

915
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,480
already have work experience right so i

916
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,400
think experience

917
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,720
can come in many different forms and you

918
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,400
shouldn't discount the experience that

919
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,200
you've built through informal experience

920
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,680
like bug bounties github contributions

921
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,960
and technical events and courses as well

922
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,760
as you know participate in infosec forms

923
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,320
these can all be ways to gain experience

924
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,280
in infosec right and a possible way of

925
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,839
getting around not having an infosec

926
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,680
internship is that you should be

927
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,040
transparent with

928
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
with your employers and show them what

929
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,079
you've learned during these informal

930
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,480
experiences and you should document

931
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,320
these experiences that taught you

932
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,800
something about infosec and then proudly

933
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,119
showcase it to employers or potential

934
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,040
freelance clients

935
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,359
so you can for instance show employers

936
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,680
some disclosed bug reports that you have

937
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,400
wrote or show them a security pass that

938
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,200
you apply to an open source project

939
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,240
or

940
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,440
you know having an internship or a job

941
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,160
they are great ways to learn but they

942
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,280
are not the only ways to learn infosec

943
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,680
skills and you need to communicate that

944
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,560
to potential employers so instead of

945
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,040
showing that you have job experience you

946
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,680
can also show employers that you have

947
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,720
the ability to self-teach or you have

948
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,359
the basic knowledge needed for the job

949
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,599
and that you can work well with others

950
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,560
and so on and these are the questions

951
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,720
that the employers are really asking for

952
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,040
when they're asking for job experience

953
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,520
so if you can prove that you possess

954
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,320
these qualities or maybe are even better

955
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,000
at these qualities than people who

956
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,800
already have prior experience often not

957
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,119
having job experience would not be a

958
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,839
deal breaker but you have to be a good

959
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,119
communicator at this point

960
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,480
so that's it

961
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,720
for my tips to launch a career in

962
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,680
infosec let's go through the tips again

963
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,359
as a review

964
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,560
my tips are first to try to explore the

965
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,920
diversity of infosec careers and keep an

966
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,160
open mind to find something that suits

967
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,960
you

968
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,880
your perfect career might be something

969
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,040
that you've never heard of in infosec

970
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,839
before and the key is to explore as much

971
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,359
as you can before committing to the one

972
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,680
that you decide to pursue

973
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
and the second one is that learning how

974
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,079
to teach yourself is the most important

975
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,400
skill set that you can ever learn or

976
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,000
master

977
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
if you are a student who's trying to get

978
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,560
into cyber security then if you don't

979
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,119
have a mentor or a

980
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,920
formal degree program to rely on you

981
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,359
need to rely on your skills and that

982
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,200
will help you teach yourself with

983
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
resources on the internet

984
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,520
and it's a useful skill for anyone even

985
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,599
people who are already in the industry

986
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,599
because the field is constantly changing

987
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,839
and you'll need to upgrade your skills

988
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,000
as you age and as you move up in your

989
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
infosec career

990
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
and the third is that you should build

991
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,760
and use your network by reaching out to

992
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,839
people in the industry uh your

993
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,920
connections are probably one of the most

994
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,680
important thing that you have in your

995
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,920
career and the people you meet can

996
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,040
really give you guidance and friendship

997
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,280
camaraderie as well as

998
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,640
job opportunities in the future

999
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,040
and you should use your online presence

1000
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,680
as a way to build reputation and

1001
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,040
credibility

1002
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,200
above all else you should always have an

1003
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,280
online presence because

1004
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,200
people will google you before they

1005
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,680
decide to hire you so make sure that

1006
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,760
your online presence showcases what you

1007
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,240
can do professionally

1008
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,800
and you can find a combination of skills

1009
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,440
that you can excel with instead of hyper

1010
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,839
focusing on a single topic

1011
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,640
infosec is a very diverse field and it's

1012
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,599
not always comprised of a ton of

1013
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,839
specialists that specialize in just

1014
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,400
penetration testing right we need people

1015
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
