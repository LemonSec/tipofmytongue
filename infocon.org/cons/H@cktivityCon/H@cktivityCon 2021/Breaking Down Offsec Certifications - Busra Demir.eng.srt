got her oecp in may 2020 and she started

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,160
creating educational content on her

16

probably already know about them

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,960
she's very inspiring for all the

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
students who are preparing for oacp

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,320
which is i believe one of the most

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,879
popular offensive secret certifications

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,480
and we'll learn more about her

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,879
certification process um during the

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,960
panel and i'm super excited to have her

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,000

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,319
my second and third panelists are andrea

28

adruka and monica talakar they are both

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
holding three offensive security

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,840
certifications oecp oswp and osce which

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,000
is an amazing path to follow i believe

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,280
to see different techniques and

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
different fields such as wireless

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,119
hacking binary exploitation network

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,119
hacking and of course much more

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,880
i know this is great because i have the

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,720
same certifications and i've entered the

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,119
same path um so i believe it's time to

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,360
introduce myself now also

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,479

oswpnoice and recently i'm preparing for

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
oace which is the hardest offense secret

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
certification i can say

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,520
and it's on advanced windows

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
exploitation and i'm hoping to get it

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,799
next year

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,880

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
knowledge as much as i can i sometimes

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,880
create youtube videos to spread my

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
knowledge and besides my hacker head i'm

52

my second question is very similar to

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
the first one uh and i'd like to ask

128
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,440
this to all panelists um how did you get

129
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,120
into hacking because everybody has

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
unique stories i believe and i'd like to

131
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
learn more about yours so monica would

132
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,520
you like to start again

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
so my journey of hacking started during

134
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,720
my graduation days i had a subject named

135
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,639
information security for one of my

136
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,680
semester

137
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,080
uh i start i found the subject to be so

138
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,479
interesting and out of curiosity i

139
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,639
started learning more about it did

140
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,479
self-study to understand about the

141
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,440
subject uh but uh i still remember

142
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
learning about cryptographic algorithms

143
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,520
web application architecture password

144
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,000
hashes that moment i realized that this

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,199
is what i want to do but no wonder uh i

146
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,440
scored the highest mark in this subject

147
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
yeah from that moment i realized that

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
this is the career path i want to go

149
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,240
through but in beginning i went through

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,400
quite quite difficulties like starting

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,080
from uh searching a job on linkedin uh

152
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
at that time during that time um

153
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,039
we didn't have a proper designation like

154
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,960
now that we have security unlimited

155
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,440
security consultant but

156
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,680
like with hard work and few months of

157
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
dedication i landed in a

158
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,680
and the company hired a few consultants

172
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,919
to come in and test the security of our

173
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,600
systems at the time i didn't know what

174
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
it was

175
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,639
what that was but when i learned what it

176
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
is i thought i advocated for quality

177
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,759
assurance to be for security testing to

178
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,360
be part of quality assurance so i

179
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,759
shouldn't be just testing that the app

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,440
is functional i should also be ensuring

181
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,680
that the app does not have any security

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,560
bugs at the time my supervisor was

183
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,360
really supportive of that idea and so he

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
asked me to develop a few test cases

185
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,919
that i could run or or manually test on

186
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,639
my own to ensure the security of the web

187
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,120
apps that we were developing

188
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
and like i said i was a beginner i had

189
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
no idea how to do it so what i ended up

190
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,520
doing is buying the web application

191
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
hackers handbook which is considered to

192
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,720
be the bible of web security um i bought

193
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,039
it i would read it at home and then i

194
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,599
would apply everything that i learned at

195
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,360
work and that's how i was introduced to

196
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840
absec and i've been in absence since

197
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,599
then

198
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
that's very impressive also very cool

199
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
story uh what about andrea how did you

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
get into hacking

201
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
so i've always had an interest in this

202
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,560
area so i just jumped right into it with

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,440
the itnc security master and from there

204
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
about three four months later i got an

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,560
internship in a security department um i

206
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
was very very happy when this happened

207
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,639
it was like for the first time i knew i

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,960
was on the right track on my career i

209
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,360
absolutely loved everything there uh the

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
job my colleagues at the time like

211
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,879
everything was perfect for me so when i

212
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,560
got the offer as a full-time engineer

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
there in the security operation center i

214
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,199
was

215
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,800
so happy so after about two three years

216
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
when i felt like that i did everything

217
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
that was there to be done in the secret

218
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,919
preparation center i was like okay it's

219
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,680
time for me to get to hacking like i

220
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,160
really want to be a pen tester so i

221
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,560
applied to a pentesting position in the

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,919
same company

223
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,840
so yeah that's when i started doing

224
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
pentest and that's when i jumped into

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,720
osap that was the beginning of my

226
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
journey with this

227
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
very impressive very impressive all of

228
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,720
your stories to be honest and mine is

229
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,120
very similar to i did double major back

230
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,560
in college with math and computer

231
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
engineering and i was thinking okay i'm

232
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,839
gonna be a software developer like rest

233
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,039
of my uh friends and i met a hacker and

234
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,958
at the time i was applying for phds in

235
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
us and i said that you know what i don't

236
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,799
want to have a phd i will just be a

237
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,240
hacker um and yeah i basically started

238
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,320
learning all about hacking and i'm so

239
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
happy i remember i was spending all my

240
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
lunch breaks just reading some assembly

241
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,080
code of a hacker to enjoy myself so yeah

242
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
very cool

243
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,320
so my next question will be for rana uh

244
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,880
rana you recently get oecp and i'd like

245
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
to learn more about your journey tell us

246
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,120
a little bit how you decided to get this

247
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,080
certificate um is it solely based on

248
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
what they cover because of its content

249
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
or is it based on the organization

250
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,480
offensive security that's issuing it

251
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,839
how did you decide to choose the first

252
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
certificate

253
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,440
good question um so usually when i'm use

254
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,000
choosing a certificate i ask myself

255
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
three questions the first question is

256
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
does the certificate cover the topic

257
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,040
that i'm interested in um the second

258
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
question would be

259
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
um is the certificate well known in the

260
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,839
community in a positive way and the

261
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,560
third question is um does a certificate

262
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,640
have a practical component so not just a

263
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,480
theory component but also a practical

264
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,720
component that i could apply in a real

265
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
world scenario and so when i was looking

266
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
for

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
pen testing certs i asked myself those

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,320
three questions and obviously the first

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
thing that popped up was the oscp

270
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
certification by offensive security and

271
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
i'm glad that i did it

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,640
and then i i am pursuing other certs as

273
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,440
well

274
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
that i haven't finished yet but i

275
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,519
applied those three criteria and and

276
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,440
that's how i select my certs

277
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,839
wow very smart very straightforward and

278
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,279
fair enough

279
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,200
um so i'd like to ask about your

280
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,680
preparation phase did you prepare all by

281
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,760
yourself or did you get any help from

282
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,160
people in the same industry or how did

283
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,720
you prepare for ostp

284
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
definitely didn't prepare all by myself

285
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,480
i always say in this field you're

286
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,959
standing on the shoulders of giants

287
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,519
whether you know it or not um

288
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,760
so i you know my primary source of

289
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
preparation was obviously the course

290
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,640
material itself after it was updated

291
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,120
um and then secondary source was above

292
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,040
well secondary sources were a bunch of

293
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,399
sources so

294
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,079
it was other platforms like htb thm and

295
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,800
so on and then you've got youtube videos

296
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,560
like ipsec's videos um you've got blogs

297
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,920
uh write-ups um and so on so and and

298
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
people that you could just ask in the

299
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
community

300
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
and so there was a ton of uh

301
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,760
reading and a ton of learning on the

302
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
side other than the course material

303
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,880
itself but obviously when you're

304
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
studying a certificate i always

305
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,079
recommend that the primary source of

306
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,240
of of learning would be the course

307
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
material itself and then the rest is

308
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,640
just secondary resources

309
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,680
that complement the primary resource

310
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,600
great points i will get into more detail

311
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,240
later with other questions but yeah

312
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
that's that's very cool summary thank

313
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,040
you

314
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,440
so my next question would be for andrea

315
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,760
um andrea i know that you are holding

316
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
three offensive certifications and they

317
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,519
are very important they are all covering

318
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,360
different fields and security and i'd

319
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
like to learn what impact did these

320
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,880
certifications have on your career

321
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,959
okay so yes like you already mentioned

322
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,720
i'm holding osp ose and oswp so i have

323
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
gained so much uh knowledge from them i

324
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,279
have learned many many new skills and a

325
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
new mindset as well so naturally this

326
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
helped me progress more and more into my

327
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,480
career

328
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,519
um

329
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,360
it was no surprise that i wanted to hand

330
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
down the certification like everyone in

331
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
the industry wants them

332
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,760
um i think that that they say something

333
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,920
about you as a security professional

334
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,480
like that that you like to try harder

335
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,800
um at oftentimes recruiters can like

336
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
reach out to you if you hold certain

337
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,560
certifications and they would uh be like

338
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,399
very straightforward like hey i noticed

339
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,079
you are ocp certified would you be

340
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,560
interested in apprenticing positions

341
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,720
so besides the extremely valuable

342
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,160
knowledge that you gain from them you

343
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,720
will also get like a larger number of

344
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
messages from recruiters that might or

345
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,160
might not influence your career path

346
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,399
definitely definitely it helps a lot uh

347
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,480
especially with the recruiters i totally

348
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
double that

349
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,160
all right so my next question would be

350
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,800
for rana um what are some of the things

351
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,920
that you learn through these

352
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,480
certifications i mean besides the

353
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,399
hacking and attacker mentality for sure

354
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
any soft skills that you learn

355
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
um yeah other than technical skills a

356
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
bunch of soft skills obviously but i

357
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,360
think the most one

358
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
you know that that i did learn from at

359
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,519
least my journey through oscp which is

360
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,399
the only cert that i hold currently is

361
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
that nothing is beyond your learning

362
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,680
capabilities

363
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,519
i come from an academic background so i

364
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,200
have a bachelor's and a master's in

365
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
computer science and mathematics

366
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,720
and usually when you're given a test

367
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,800
through university or through school or

368
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
whatnot you

369
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,120
you're expected to have been taught all

370
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
the material that you're tested on so

371
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
you know you're either given lectures or

372
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,079
a book or so on um and that material

373
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,320
will appear in the exam and so i

374
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
approached the oscp the first time

375
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,240
around in that mentality um and that

376
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,800
that was completely destroyed um in in

377
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
only a couple of days where i realized

378
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,959
you can't expect to learn everything

379
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,880
through only the course material itself

380
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,800
you can't learn hacking through only you

381
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,360
know a book or a step-by-step guide you

382
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,279
had to be able to google things you had

383
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,160
to be able to refer to other resources

384
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
and so on

385
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,279
and that was really personally

386
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,839
beneficial to me because it

387
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,920
removed the bad habit for me where i

388
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
would ask for training or i would ask

389
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,120
for a book or i would ask for a video to

390
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
teach me something instead of having to

391
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,199
learn it on my own and i think that was

392
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,959
you know even more than the technical

393
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,320
material itself i think that was the

394
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,959
most beneficial thing that i gained uh

395
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,199
from the oscp certification which is the

396
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,079
ability to kind of depend on my own and

397
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,160
be able to learn things on the fly um

398
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,639
and that nothing is really beyond my

399
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,560
capability it's just really a matter of

400
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,800
time energy and then you know resources

401
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,639
in terms of like you know being

402
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,040
surrounded by people that you can ask

403
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
for help when you get

404
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
stuck and i think that would be the most

405
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,360
important soft skill that i learned

406
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,440
through my journey when i was doing that

407
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,959
certification

408
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,199
i totally agree with you i think we

409
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,720
learn how to learn during this

410
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
certification process instead of just a

411
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,560
spoon fed

412
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,839
exactly

413
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
very cool thank you for your answer uh

414
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
i'd like to ask another question to

415
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,279
monica

416
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,959
uh i know that again you are holding

417
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,959
three certificates oh cpo is double gano

418
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,680
with

419
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
do you think the certificate uh was

420
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
outdated what do you think about the

421
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
content

422
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,759
i'll keep this answer short because uh

423
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,560
uh

424
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
yeah so most of the offensive security

425
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,279
courses are up to date but according to

426
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,839
few forum it was said that uh osc

427
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,720
technique stored in osc is bit outdated

428
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,279
but according to me like i think this

429
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,440
technique can be modified a bit and

430
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,480
still can be used for further learnings

431
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,759
so now that osce is retired i think most

432
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,759
of the certifications are up to date

433
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,519
i totally agree with you yeah it's

434
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,519
basically teaching you the baseline of

435
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,000
it and you're just adding something

436
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,120
on it i don't agree perfect and another

437
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
question for andrea so do you think

438
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,920
certificates will be helpful for those

439
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
uh interested in black bounty or pen

440
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,360
testing

441
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
of course always um so i think that

442
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,480
every material that brings new knowledge

443
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,720
is always helpful uh like whether we're

444
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,399
talking about the course like a lab a

445
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,279
training a video or an article so i want

446
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,839
to emphasize here however the fact that

447
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,360
um i think that you can be a very

448
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
skilled security professional without

449
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
holding any certification like this is

450
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
definitely not the requirements uh but

451
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,160
sure it's nice to have and but but it's

452
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,720
not a must-have so however

453
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,079
the amount of knowledge that you can

454
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,079
gain from a course from like aiming

455
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,120
towards the certification such as oscp

456
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
is huge so i remember when i first

457
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,399
started off in my princess in career the

458
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,279
first thing i did was sign up for oscp

459
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,959
like i knew it would help me gain the

460
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,600
skills necessary for my uh bug bounty

461
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,400
and bug bounty hunting and ben testing

462
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,640
so like it took me step by step and made

463
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
me realize that there are multiple

464
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
possibilities of exploiting a machine

465
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
that i need to look into every corner

466
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
each service and to like never give up

467
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,959
and to always try harder so yeah

468
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,799
starting off my career as a princess

469
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,240
with the recipe was like the best

470
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,039
decision that i ever made

471
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,799
definitely definitely i can just double

472
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,880
that i totally agree with you

473
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,720
uh another question very similar to that

474
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
but i'd like to ask this to monica um do

475
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,720
you think a certificate is necessary to

476
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
be a pentester

477
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,120
according to me i think to be a

478
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,280
pentester two things are most important

479
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
first is knowledge and second is

480
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,600
curiosity i think university can come

481
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,080
from within but knowledge can be gained

482
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,799
via doing a certification playing ctf

483
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,440
doing bug bounty reading blogs or

484
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,280
attending a workshop or a talk in a

485
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,679
conference but at times when i am doing

486
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,080
web application testing or mobile pen

487
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,480
testing any kind of pen testing

488
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
and i am like stuck into exploiting a

489
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
kind of vulnerability i do refer

490
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
publicly disclose books available on

491
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
activity hacker one this really helps me

492
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
to enhance my pen testing skills

493
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,320
otherwise like likewise i do conduct a

494
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480
workshop if i want to learn something

495
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
new i do conduct a workshop in the

496
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,000
process of constructing the whole

497
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
workshop i get a better understanding of

498
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,039
the concept very well but personally for

499
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,360
me i think os uh offensive security

500
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,679
process has helped me a lot to be a

501
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,600
better pen testing but be a better

502
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
fantastic actually

503
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,400
i totally agree and i'd like to ask what

504
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,480
are some of the challenges that you had

505
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,400
to overcome while you're preparing for

506
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
these certifications like time

507
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
management learning paths anything that

508
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
you can share with us

509
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,559
yes for me every certification has its

510
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,480
own journey and a set of challenges

511
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
associated with it so here i like to

512
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,919
give example like uh for if for my every

513
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,280
certification for like oscp uh it was

514
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,120
quite difficult to manage time with a

515
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,679
full-time job so in order to manage all

516
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,200
these things i

517
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,280
managed the time in such a way that on

518
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
weekdays i'll spend around two to three

519
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,520
hours and on weekday weekends i'll spend

520
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,679
around five to six hours and i made it

521
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,679
strict in such a way that i have to

522
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
complete this yeah other set of

523
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,520
challenge was like the feeling of giving

524
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,480
up at times when i was stuck uh on

525
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
various machine for quite a number of

526
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,000
days uh

527
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
but yeah it was very difficult uh

528
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,240
feeling of like giving up uh other

529
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,440
challenge was uh while doing osw this

530
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
was my longer journey of about nine to

531
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,039
ten months and i cleared the

532
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,679
certification on my third attempt so but

533
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,720
my dedication hard work and patience and

534
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,080
try harder motto kept me going

535
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
yeah i i can totally create this picture

536
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,000
in my head because when i was getting

537
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,840
osc i remember

538
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
i was only sleeping four hours per day

539
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,480
and i was preparing eight hours per day

540
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
for the certification so it was like

541
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,000
crazy but

542
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,280
at the same time it was the best time of

543
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,640
my life so

544
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,559
we're all crazy being a hacker i guess

545
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,200
so my next question would be for andrea

546
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,640
so how long did you prepare for all

547
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,799
these certifications always cpo is wp

548
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,200
and osce there are three certifications

549
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,320
they took

550
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,000
they take years to get these

551
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,919
certifications people say how long did

552
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,840
you spend time on these

553
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,200
so i had three months for oacp and one

554
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,280
month for oac and a few weeks for the

555
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,640
oswp i have invested around 8 hours a

556
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,799
day for them i wouldn't go to bed unless

557
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,799
i was happy with my work and effort that

558
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,120
day uh so because i had just started

559
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,960
with pentesting a few months

560
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,440
prior i had to prove myself

561
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,760
so i thought to myself that if i gain

562
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,600
these certifications then it's good it

563
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,840
means i did it and that i was made for

564
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,919
this um the great thing about the

565
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,679
offensive security materials is that

566
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,679
they come with both pdfs and videos so

567
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,840
it like never really gets boring you are

568
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,440
watching the videos you are reading the

569
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,320
pdfs and doing alongside on your machine

570
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,760
and suddenly everything is so much

571
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,360
easier to understand you don't even

572
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,159
realize when a few hours have passed by

573
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,520
so basically the labs are your

574
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,120
playgrounds and the machines are there

575
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,200
for you to compromise them so for myself

576
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,960
it was like a really great great

577
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
achievement when i have rooted all the

578
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,640
machines from the osp lab so this is why

579
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,480
i stayed three months like i wanted to

580
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
make sure that i'm understanding

581
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,080
everything while still

582
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,159
going to my full-time job

583
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,240
so if you don't have a full-time job i

584
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,720
believe one or two months would suffice

585
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,400
as well

586
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,559
it's very impressive how much time you

587
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,919
spend on this really kudos to you

588
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,159
so my next question would be for rana

589
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,000
how did you practice for the exams i

590
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
mean what external resources did you use

591
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
i know that you mentioned already thm

592
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,400
hack the box but um can you give us more

593
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,159
details about this and i'm sure that a

594
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,840
lot of people are looking forward to

595
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,000
hear this as i know that oecp is very

596
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,880
popular in the industry

597
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
um so definitely did not take me one or

598
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,320
two months to prepare for the oscp it

599
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
took me quite a while it was the first

600
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
time i was introduced to pen testing so

601
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,400
i had absec experience

602
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,880
but i had zero experience in uh pen

603
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,520
testing so when i first enrolled in the

604
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,799
oscp itself um you know i had run and

605
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,240
map maybe a handful of times um and so

606
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,600
and for those of you that enrolled in

607
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,760
the previous version of the oscp know

608
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,440
that you know you're

609
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,400
pretty much doomed at this point

610
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,440
and so when i first enrolled in it i had

611
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,240
a really really really difficult time

612
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,679
with the material i had a really

613
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,760
difficult time with the videos i had a

614
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,280
really difficult time with the labs and

615
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,240
so on

616
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,720
my lap time expired and i promised

617
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,039
myself i won't go back to the labs until

618
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,679
i feel like i'm fully prepared uh for

619
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,760
the exam itself not even you know just

620
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,039
the labs and this is when i started um

621
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,520
you know looking for secondary resources

622
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,640
to prepare for the oscp and one of the

623
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,679
main secondary resources that i prepared

624
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,559
that i used for preparation was uh hack

625
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,880
the box so htb

626
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,400
tj now has a list of oscp-like htb boxes

627
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
that are similar to the boxes in

628
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,960
in the oscp labs and the oscp exam

629
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,360
and so i promise that i will do a

630
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,480
majority of those boxes before i go back

631
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,240
into the oscp labs and i managed to

632
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,960
finish all of them you know before that

633
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
list got updated after i did the exam

634
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,280
but i managed to do all of them i would

635
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,400
spend

636
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,559
maybe three to four hours

637
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,400
after work every day and then full

638
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,039
weekends just working on those boxes and

639
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,600
while i did that um i would make notes

640
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,640
you know

641
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,320
i would say you know today i encountered

642
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,480
port 80 and this is what i tried today i

643
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,720
encountered you know port so and so and

644
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,240
this is what i tried until i came up

645
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,799
with like a full um

646
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,440
list of uh you know things and attack

647
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,159
vectors that i would try um if i ever

648
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,200
encountered you know so and so services

649
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,559
um and and yeah so once i was done with

650
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,640
tj nell's list i felt confident enough

651
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,679
to go back into the labs i enrolled in a

652
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,000
one-month subscription so i extended my

653
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,760
time for one month

654
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,279
i was able to compromise a large portion

655
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,360
of the machines during that

656
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,600
one month and finish the updated

657
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,120
material

658
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,600
in about two weeks

659
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
and write the report which was just like

660
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,600
200 pages long by the end of it for the

661
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,320
updated material um and so i felt

662
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,760
prepared to go into

663
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,960
into the exam although i haven't

664
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,559
finished all the um all the uh you know

665
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,960
all the boxes in the labs and once i did

666
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,919
that um i went into the exam and i

667
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,320
passed it um and you know as part of the

668
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,559
journey of for those of you most of you

669
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,000
that do know me know me from my get

670
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,600
books i have a gift book that is

671
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,559
published and it contains all um all the

672
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,960
write-ups for all the boxes i personally

673
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,440
wrote them in a way that i you know you

674
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
know focused on enumeration which is

675
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,559
which is how i see that try harder

676
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,279
mentality um which is just enumerate

677
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,440
more try uh different things um and and

678
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
yeah i hope uh you know other people

679
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,880
have found it useful and i hope other

680
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,640
people who do encounter it for the first

681
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,320
time find it useful in terms of

682
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,279
preparation for the oscp so that was my

683
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,320
main uh secondary uh source of

684
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,000
preparation other than that like i said

685
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,960
there's ipsex videos um

686
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,520
those videos are a gold mine i think i

687
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,720
watched

688
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,360
them on repeat and multiple times each

689
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,080
video um and then just in general you

690
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,520
know the people that are around you the

691
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,960
people that are online that are willing

692
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,600
to help you and so on so just uh making

693
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
sure that you're not you know you're

694
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,919
comfortable asking questions um and that

695
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,679
no question is stupid because you're on

696
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,720
this journey and you're gonna have to

697
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,960
ask that question whether now or later

698
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
and you might and it's better to ask it

699
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
now than you know further

700
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,880
along your career

701
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
and so that's how i prepared

rana and my next question would be for

714
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
andrea again

715
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,640
um andrea what's your ad but advice for

716
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,320
someone who is uh

717
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,600
trying to get a few of these

718
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,360
certifications because you're already

719
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,120
holding three of them and you went

720
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
through very impressive uh preparation

721
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,480
yourself so what's your advice for

722
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,080
people out there who are trying to get

723
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
them

724
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,039
go for it

725
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,960
i would actually say jump straight into

726
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,799
it like don't wait um just make sure

727
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,400
that you have some general security

728
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
knowledge for example that you are aware

729
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,679
of the common vulnerabilities that are

730
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,000
out there for example your stop then

731
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,600
make sure you are reading first some

732
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,159
security testing guides as well so that

733
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,000
you can get a feel of what you are going

734
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,559
to expect um during your journey towards

735
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,960
the offensive security certification of

736
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,039
your choice um

737
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,840
so just set up a goal and go for it uh

738
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
if you want for example to jump straight

739
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,600
into osp then of course the materials in

740
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,440
the labs are very very useful so don't

741
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,960
worry they are more than sufficient in

742
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,880
order to pass the exam

743
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,480
uh if you want to prepare first there

744
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,720
are lots of free high quality training

745
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,200
resources like uh we've already

746
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,039
mentioned like for example if you're

747
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,799
looking into exploiting machines then

748
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,120
one hub and hack the box are really

749
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,840
great resources um of course you can

750
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,360
like always search on the internet if

751
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,720
you want to gain additional knowledge

752
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,559
like if you get stuck at some point i'm

753
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,240
pretty sure you will find a blog article

754
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,840
that covers it so yeah that's

755
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,159
it again great uh pro tips thank you so

756
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,760
much andrea

757
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,600
uh monica my next question would be for

758
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,520
you uh do you think prior knowledge is

759
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,960
needed to prepare for all these

760
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,720
certifications

761
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,919
of course i

762
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,559
uh prior knowledges do require uh for

763
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,720
before signing up for any courses here

764
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
i'd like to give one example how i

765
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,919
prepared while i was doing osap i got

766
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,840
comfortable with linux and networking

767
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,120
skills

768
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,600
and learned to write how bad script and

769
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,480
python script and solve various uh

770
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,880
vulnerable machine available on

771
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,919
one hub

772
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,120
to get a approach of the lapse and while

773
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,840
i was doing osc i got when was with

774
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,640
reverse engineering and shell coding i

775
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,720
also solved various

776
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,679
vulnerable binaries like one server and

777
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,159
exploits available on exploit db this

778
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,600
really helped me to solve the

779
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,919
registration challenge before signing up

780
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,240
for the course but while i was doing

781
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,840
oswe

782
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,799
i got velvet with debuggers like um dn

783
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,840
spy

784
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,360
uh

785
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,320
vs code and also like uh

786
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,120
python script is most important in osw

787
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,799
as you have to keep on scripting

788
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,840
everything so i did uh well was with all

789
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,919
the python scripting so according to me

790
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,840
i think if you are going with any

791
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,559
courses uh understand the prerequisite

792
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,600
or the syllabus and go to as many as

793
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,720
resources available online

794
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,320
i totally agree like i said i'm

795
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
preparing for osce now i know there's an

796
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,640
advanced certification but i'm preparing

797
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,960
for it like for four months i guess and

798
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
i'm still not ready i didn't get the lab

799
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,559
material yet i'm just trying to feel

800
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,039
comfortable so i guess it applies to

801
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,720
some of the certificate certificates

802
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,000
especially if they're beginner

803
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,919
certificates maybe you don't need a lot

804
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,919
of knowledge maybe it's enough for you

805
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,679
to go through the syllabus but for more

806
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,080
advanced months probably probably it's

807
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,640
needed yeah totally agree with you

808
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,559
perfect so i have one more question

809
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,000
that's for rana

810
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,520
uh rana what certifications do you

811
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
recommend for folks who are interested

812
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,720
in web packing or pen testing

813
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,600
um

814
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,360
all right so let's start off with web

815
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,840
hacking i think the most amazing free

816
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
resource and you know whether it's free

817
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,679
or paid um it's still an amazing

818
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,600
resource um the most amazing resource

819
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,640
there is is the web security academy uh

820
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
by port portswigger

821
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
i remember when i first encountered it i

822
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,559
couldn't believe one that it's free and

823
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,080
i couldn't believe that existed because

824
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,000
i'm a huge fan of the love application

825
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,320
hackers handbook and it's the same

826
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,039
authors that authored the academy except

827
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,919
this time around it's more practical

828
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,559
and has exercises i remember when i

829
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,120
encountered i thought i encountered it i

830
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
thought that the only thing that is

831
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
missing in in that you know learning

832
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,799
resource or learning platform was videos

833
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,960
so verbal explanation and that's why i

834
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,960
personally decided to do videos for um

835
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,559
for the web security academy and my

836
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,679
videos got integrated in the academy

837
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,039
itself

838
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,279
so for web hacking this is

839
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,440
you know the one resource fundamental

840
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,919
resource that i would recommend um and

841
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,919
then if you want to level up i would

842
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,320
recommend the oswe

843
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,880
um and that's more source code

844
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,240
review um i'm personally doing that cert

845
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,200
um

846
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,279
and hope to be done with it either end

847
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,279
of this year or next year i've been

848
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,720
slacking off on it because of the

849
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,559
youtube videos um but i do hope to

850
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,120
finish it either this year or or next

851
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,279
year um in terms of pen testing

852
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,080
obviously there is the oscp

853
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
which i highly recommend because i've

854
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,360
personally done it and it's really

855
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,320
benefited me um but there's also another

856
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,919
cert that recently came up um tcm

857
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,440
academy so it's called the pmpt i do not

858
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,960
remember what that stands for i think

859
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,039
it's practical network penetration

860
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,600
tester or something along those lines um

861
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,240
so when i was studying for the oscp i

862
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,120
did take the cyber mentors courses

863
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,600
so that's what tcm stands for

864
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,120
um

865
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,159
yes that's what tcm stands for

866
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,799
and i was doing it in my head

867
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,880
and i found those courses to be really

868
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,039
useful in fact i would always recommend

869
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,039
doing those courses as preparation

870
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,679
before the oscp so you know there's the

871
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,399
pmpt the oscp and there's one more that

872
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,840
i would really really recommend by

873
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,720
pentester academy which is attacking and

874
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,480
defending active directory and other

875
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,960
cert that i'm doing and that cert is

876
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,600
more on the active directory side which

877
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,320
most organizations use and it's usually

878
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
not covered very extensively in other

879
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
certifications and so i always recommend

880
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,279
getting that cert as well if you're

881
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,679
interested in more network uh pen

882
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,799
testing versus web app uh pen testing

883
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,640
and yeah those are the certs that i

884
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
would recommend i'm sure there's much

885
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,080
more but those are the ones that i

886
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,880
personally have experienced in um and so

887
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,760
i would personally recommend

888
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,279
thank you for all the pro tips i'm sure

889
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,519
that they are so valuable and um i'm

890
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,880
sure that people will start checking

891
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,919
these certifications after hearing you

892
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,600
so that will be all the questions that i

893
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,320
have for today and thank you so much all

894
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,159
um for all the answers and the great

895
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,320
conversation that we had today i believe

896
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,919
this will inspire a lot of people out

897
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,200
there who are trying to go through the

898
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,960
same path or trying to achieve these

899
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,640

harder and i'd like to also thank

so that our stories can reach out to our

905
