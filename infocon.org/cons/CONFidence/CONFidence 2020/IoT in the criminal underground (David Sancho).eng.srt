1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,559
hi guys uh welcome to my talk

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
so what i'm going to talk about it's not

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,000
the

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,320
technical side of iot attacks and iot

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,440
devices

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,680
this is more interesting because what we

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,600
are noticing

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,400
is that whenever we hear on the news

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:24,800
about

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,279
iot attacks the kind of the kind of

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,039
attacks that they are right

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,439
they tend to focus on the theoretical

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,159
attacks

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,480
the kind of attacks that can happen as

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,440
opposed to the

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
kind of attacks that are happening and

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
that's a very very big distinction right

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,239
because you can talk theoretically about

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,879
barbie dolls being attacked but yeah are

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,960
they actually happening those attacks

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,039
not really and we're gonna see how this

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,480
is the kind of stuff

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
that uh the the media are talking on the

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,719
news right

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,960
i i put that there as a news header

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,920
because that it

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,039
has actually been used at the iot

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,399
armageddon

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,600
wow look at this this this is a real

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,880
um a real news header from 2017

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
five nightmarish attacks right they call

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,600
it nightmarish like it's gonna cause you

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,080
nightmares that's going to be terrifying

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,960
another one is uh this is kind of true

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,560
right iot attacks are getting worse

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
they are getting worse but no one's

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,920
listening why

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,720
but well let's see this is very very

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,520
scary

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,680
the five worst examples of iot hacking

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,960
and vulnerabilities

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,520
it's like wow you know lots and lots of

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,119
very new attacks against

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,640
amazing uh kinds of uh devices

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,280
and this is a another one cyber attacks

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,920
on the rise

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,000
iot and ddos right the world gonna end

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,360
very soon um in the in the actual

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,240
real life well this is another example

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,520
this is my favorite example because

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
every time that you see a news header

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
with a an exotic device being vulnerable

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,920
they always start with a cyber or the

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,680
toaster your toaster is going to be

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,479
attacked

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,640
it was like a toaster once i started

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
researching iot attacks i started to

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,280
okay

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,400
maybe there are everybody has toasters

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,040
that can

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,959
can be online right i have a regular

62
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,400
toaster so i

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,680
i don't know about this so i started

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
researching and there's not actually

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,920
any toaster that can be purchased this

66
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,879
is from

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,160
uh from ces 2017 so this is a

68
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
theoretical

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,640
toaster that i can't i can't find

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,239
online i couldn't buy it on amazon so my

71
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,160
toaster can be attacked but i can't buy

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,400
any toaster that can be online so what's

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
the point right

74
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,280
this is uh the kind of thing that we can

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
see you know the iot invasion how to

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,680
avoid being hacked by your toaster

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,959
okay what toaster um

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
again every time you see this news

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
header my toaster hacked the pentagon

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,000
really wow and i can't find any toasters

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
i can't get online

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
uh this is another one you know as i was

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
saying before uh the hello barbie

84
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
uh wow your barbie doll can be hacked

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,560
and the barbie can inspire your children

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,040
really i mean

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,640
we need to settle this right because

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,239
this news headers are

89
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,599
very terrifying and uh i doubt that

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,159
these

91
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,360
iot devices are really in the plans of

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,760
any

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,519
real criminal like we're talking real

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,120
world hackers right

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,400
so what we did it's try to look at

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,720
the real this is the reality somebody

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
using mirai botnets to shut down

98
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,360
countries that makes sense now that now

99
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,319
we can see that

100
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,519
what does uh mirai uh work on does it

101
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,080
work on barbie dolls or in toasters

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,519
no it works on normal devices right like

103
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:45,840
uh

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,120
routers routers are the most uh common

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
device

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,879
to hack by far like there's not even a

107
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,159
comparison

108
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,879
there's some printers that can be can be

109
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,200
uh

110
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
hacked and can be monetized but the

111
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,799
monetization plans are really routers

112
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,920
not barbie dolls not toasters not

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,319
any craziness and yet we see the news

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,920
headers going like this

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
the botnet of smart air conditioners and

116
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,760
heaters

117
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
air conditioners or heaters i mean who

118
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,279
is using that to hack anything you know

119
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,399
we don't see that and

120
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,759
we only see it in the news but we don't

121
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,600
see it in real life criminals are not

122
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,880
using these devices

123
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,000
so what we went and did is uh try

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
to survey the criminal underground of

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,560
russian uh language uh portuguese

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
uh instead of the portugal flag i put

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
their brazil

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
because uh the portuguese speaking

129
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
underground is mostly focused on brazil

130
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
then the english underground

131
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
spanish-speaking underground and arabic

132
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
speaking underground

133
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
we surveyed those five environments

134
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,720
trying to see

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,199
what the hackers were targeting what

136
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,360
kind of attacks they were planning

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,680
and very important if there is actually

138
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,360
a monetization plan because if there's

139
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,880
no monetization plan

140
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
what's what is good for a hacker to hack

141
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,800
why would you hack something that you

142
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
can't make any money off

143
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,560
you hack your barbie and you listen to

144
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,759
somebody's kid

145
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,080
screaming what's the point right that's

146
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,440
not gonna happen

147
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,120
from the defense perspective yeah you

148
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
might defend against it from the attack

149
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,000
perspective

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
why bother so we wanted to see if

151
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
there's any monetization plan

152
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,080
for those people then we see the

153
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,680
distinction between all of these uh

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,560
five kinds of undergrounds so first

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,720
let's clarify what is iot what do we

156
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,400
consider to be iot

157
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,759
so any device any device that

158
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,639
uh does not have a a normal operating

159
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,840
system a windows

160
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,800
operating system anything is fair game

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,280
so we

162
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,560
we can see there like uh dog feeders

163
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,800
printers air conditioners that's fair

164
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,680
game

165
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
all of these kind of devices we don't

166
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
consider it to be

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,120
phones so phones in a different

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
environment we're not going to talk

169
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,280
about phones

170
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,120
not servers not desktops nothing

171
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,400
this is the kind of thing that we're

172
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
talking about so what do we see

173
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,479
what kind of devices do we see it being

174
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,080
attacked the most of course

175
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,720
routers we're going to talk about the

176
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,919
monetization plan

177
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,840
um first on cameras online cameras are

178
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
are very interesting now and you think

179
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,759
why would you bother to

180
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,080
check on a camera to look and hack a

181
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,960
camera

182
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,479
the camera is very interesting because

183
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,319
it's pointing somewhere right

184
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,400
and that somewhere maybe potentially

185
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,960
interesting for other hackers to look at

186
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
why you can see number one uh for

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,639
perverts very very easy all these

188
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,759
cameras that have

189
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
uh like like that's a beauty salon at

190
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,960
some point somebody

191
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
is going to show something there right

192
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,800
and you can see that it's wide open on

193
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,600
the internet there's

194
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
the ip don't try the ip it doesn't work

195
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,199
anymore but

196
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,000
that ip at some point had that password

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,880
and that

198
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,479
username there you can see the port

199
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,400
there and

200
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,560
that's interesting it's interesting i

201
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,919
mean there's a public who

202
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,680
who might find it interesting and would

203
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,000
potentially buy access to them

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
what else is interesting and this is

205
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,520
much much better right

206
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,000
uh there's a lot of security cameras on

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,639
top

208
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,720
of payment systems and this is you can

209
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,759
tell that

210
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,160
you can see the cart whenever somebody

211
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,520
inserts the car you're going to be able

212
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,319
to see

213
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,240
the the car and you can see the pin

214
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,599
being entered so that's super

215
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,639
interesting right that's

216
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,240
immediately much more interesting for

217
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,720
any criminal and

218
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,599
you can see any warehouse anything that

219
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,440
has a security system

220
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,960
when when you're able to monitor the

221
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
security system you can see

222
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,000
when the the the guards come in when the

223
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,919
cars go out what the ships are like so

224
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,280
if you're planning on robbing a

225
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,160
warehouse

226
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
having uh the camera access to all of

227
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,560
the warehouse

228
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,599
you can see when the the the trucks are

229
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,319
coming

230
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,560
what kind of material is coming when the

231
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
guards are off

232
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,280
you can see everything so how do you

233
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,720
make money out of this

234
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
now you can see this um this is uh on

235
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
the pervy side right all the

236
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,039
changing rooms i have no idea why a

237
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,800
chain changing room would be

238
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,680
on an open webcam but there's a lot of

239
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,000
them

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
so what the bad guys do is they package

241
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
all those uh

242
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,000
into channels like netflix and then they

243
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,520
sell access to them like you can see

244
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,240
there right

245
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
all of these uh channels all of these

246
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
are camps like

247
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000
pervy kind of uh cameras and then you

248
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,280
can see the access

249
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,840
it's 50 rubles that's very very common

250
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,039
in the russian underground

251
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,039
and then they accept visa for payment

252
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,800
perfect right that's one way of

253
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,919
monetizing

254
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,760
they do it thematically so they do the

255
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,279
porn channels or the

256
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,880
beauty cam channels and they do the

257
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,000
the atm channels there's

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,880
a a variety of different themes that uh

259
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
you can pay for so if you're interested

260
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,200
for ins

261
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,360
for instance in in getting and cloning

262
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,480
uh credit cards

263
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
you go into one of these channels and

264
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
then you can get all of that

265
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,920
uh at the end of the day all these are

266
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,480
either open cams or camps with default

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
passwords so that's immediately

268
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,839
interesting if you can

269
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
use a vulnerability to to have access

270
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,839
to a closed webcam all the better right

271
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,360
that's worth a lot more

272
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
but these are the cheap ones you can see

273
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,399
that the prices are really really cheap

274
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,440
50 rubles

275
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,279
is not allowed to access one of these

276
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,600
channels so that's way of monetizing

277
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
another way of monetizing and now

278
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,959
they're talking about routers which are

279
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,760
by far

280
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,959
the most popular is selling ssh tunnels

281
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,680
so they get

282
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
into your router and then they install

283
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,080
a node of a vpn so that now

284
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,680
your router is now an exit node of a vpn

285
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
and then these guys the criminals go

286
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,440
online and then they sell

287
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,200
access to your and any other

288
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,320
member of that botnet for sale so you

289
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
can see there

290
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
this one this guy is selling ssh tunnels

291
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,440
or vpn

292
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
that it's sitting on private home

293
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,519
routers they they exclusively say that

294
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,600
because it's very difficult for

295
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
isps to block this so they're selling it

296
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,240
and there's a clear monetization plan so

297
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
there is the reason for criminals to

298
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
take over your router

299
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,399
and own it because they can sell access

300
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,079
to it

301
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,240
through a vpn channel the vpn

302
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
channel yeah this is another example you

303
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
know ssh tunnels

304
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,640
being sold they're not that they're not

305
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,160
that expensive if you look at the prices

306
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,640
they're super super cheap

307
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,920
and then they they particularly say home

308
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,959
or office routers so

309
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,720
this is really good because if you're a

310
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
criminal and you go online and buy

311
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
a vpn that's sitting on somebody's

312
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,680
router then your exit note it's that

313
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,000
uh that ip that the ip of that router

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,839
right so

315
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,320
the police will see that somebody is

316
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
being attacked or robbed

317
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
with an ip from a guy in argentina who

318
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,640
god knows right

319
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,200
and very difficult to trace and of

320
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,920
course there's no

321
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,200
official vpn logs so it's very very

322
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,000
handy for

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
criminals this is another example again

324
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,000
same thing

325
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,560
and it's telling telling you um

326
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,920
specifically

327
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,200
they're renting a botnet spot with mirai

328
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,079
and you can see the speed and it's also

329
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:14,720
for

330
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,839
um for ddos you can you can uh

331
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
tell what the throughput is so you can

332
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,079
even use it for for ddos

333
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,160
uh by the way ddos is very very common

334
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
so i i neglected to say that but

335
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,360
vpn it's super common but if you have

336
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,920
access

337
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,640
to the router then you can redirect any

338
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
amount of packets through

339
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,399
that uh through that node right so you

340
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,200
can use it as

341
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,079
a ddos uh channel so that's why they

342
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,760
tell the throughput there so you can use

343
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
it as a channel or you can use it as a

344
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,160
as a vpn now this is a

345
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
really interesting one that we saw in

346
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
brazil in

347
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,920
up until now very common in the in the

348
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,639
russian

349
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,800
underground this one is relatively

350
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,560
common in the brazilian underground in

351
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
the portuguese speaking area

352
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,399
so what they do is they they take over

353
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,160
your router and once they have access to

354
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
the router they change the dns

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
right so then people behind the router

356
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,279
they

357
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,480
they the dns is not exactly working well

358
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,000
right so they go to google and they

359
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,480
probably

360
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
they redirect you to google without any

361
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
problem but

362
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,000
then they have the possibility of

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,440
changing those uh

364
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,160
uh those uh conversions right the dns

365
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,040
conversion

366
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,160
so they do that with uh with specific

367
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,720
banks right so they go to bank of brazil

368
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,079
and instead of going to the real bank of

369
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,040
brazil

370
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,680
they go to a fake bank of brazil why do

371
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
they do that because then

372
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,200
once you have a botnet of uh infected

373
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,639
routers then you sell dns

374
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,200
redirections to people willing to do

375
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,760
phishing

376
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,120
so if you're a client right then

377
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
you set up a phishing site for bank of

378
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,160
brazil

379
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,040
then you go to the botnet uh owner and

380
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,120
says okay could you redirect

381
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,880
all of your routers bank of brazil dns

382
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,720
uh routing to my fake site so then

383
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,880
all of those people behind the router

384
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,440
they go to bangkok brazil.com writing it

385
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,519
you know not a bad link a real link

386
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,399
and then they'll be redirected to the

387
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:16,800
fake

388
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,160
website so you can see um

389
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,680
you can see an example of an

390
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
advertisement

391
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
it's not very expensive if you look at

392
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,360
this it's a 1000 reais

393
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,839
per week that works out like 250

394
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,800
dollars per week that's not a lot i mean

395
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
if you have a

396
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
fishing site and you manage to have true

397
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
dns redirections to your fake side

398
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,720
you can make that in with a couple of

399
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,680
customers you know

400
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
a couple of victims so that's not really

401
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,399
bad and it's very very good for

402
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,959
um for the botnet owner if you have a

403
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,320
bunch of infected

404
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,279
botnets a bunch of infected routers with

405
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,160
with this system

406
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,320
then you can sell those redirections

407
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,800
pretty quickly very very easily

408
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
here's another another example you know

409
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,279
again the same you know pretty much uh

410
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,360
the prices are are very similar they

411
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,639
call it kl

412
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,600
dns banker so it's it's a dns

413
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,959
redirection system

414
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,880
for infected routers that's again

415
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,279
something very novel we've only seen it

416
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,519
in the portuguese speaking underground

417
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,320
and it's a clear way of monetizing an

418
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,240
infected router so if you infect a

419
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,000
router how do you make money of it well

420
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,079
you can install a dns redirection system

421
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,480
other than that what have we seen the

422
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,440
portuguese

423
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
underground and the russian underground

424
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,279
very very

425
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,120
active in trying to own routers and own

426
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,000
mostly routers in the rest of the

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,800
undergrounds like

428
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,240
this is an example of english

429
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,160
underground right there's a lot of

430
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,120
interest

431
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,079
in owning but more in the knowledge side

432
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,639
they want to know how right this is

433
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,839
uh using exploits to own uh netgear

434
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,639
routers

435
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,079
using exploits to exploit printers

436
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,399
but there's no clear monetization why

437
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,440
it's more of

438
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,839
i want to hack it because i can as

439
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,560
opposed to

440
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,399
i want to hack it because it will make

441
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,920
me money so

442
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,399
once you own a printer what do you do

443
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,240
you reboot it i don't know what

444
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
it's very limited that the amount of

445
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,440
stuff that you can do with a with a

446
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
remote printer you can print stuff

447
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,399
right hello but it's not not

448
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,040
really the focus of these undergrounds

449
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,560
these undergrounds have not

450
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,759
found yet a way of making money off of

451
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,959
those infections

452
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,120
so they focus more on the knowledge on

453
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,079
the how to

454
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,800
hack um this is a

455
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,199
interesting one right on uh on the

456
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,360
english speaking underground

457
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,639
with a router scan you know it scans the

458
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,000
whatever ip range that you want it scans

459
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,199
for a router

460
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,040
and uh it tries to uh see which ones uh

461
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,279
may be exploitable or not so you see

462
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,800
which which uh

463
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,440
which routers are online and then it

464
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,079
tries to

465
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,800
check with usernames and passwords is it

466
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,000
useful

467
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,240
it's marginally useful i mean i think

468
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,199
that this

469
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,399
shows an interest by the hackers for

470
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,519
owning routers

471
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,720
but there is no clear monetization plan

472
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,600
behind so

473
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
you own the router username and password

474
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
and after that i don't know you're on

475
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,759
your own

476
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,519
so there's no clear monetization there's

477
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
no clear why why would you do this i'm

478
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
not sure what a hacker would do

479
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,160
with with these owned routers you know

480
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,199
you have to

481
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,399
um infect them somehow but the the

482
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,680
infection is separate

483
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,519
from the intention of owning them which

484
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,880
is the only thing that

485
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,639
is shown in these undergrounds

486
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,399
this is an interesting one and this

487
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,800
apparently was a portuguese guy

488
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
uh and he was uh he was uh

489
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,639
advertising on uh the english

490
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,839
underground and uh

491
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,000
speaking uh portuguese speaking and

492
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
spanish speaking underground and

493
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
he made apparently i haven't been able

494
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,480
to test but

495
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,599
the advertisement is selling a tool

496
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,199
that will look whole ip

497
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,679
ranges for a specific device in this

498
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,319
case it's an

499
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,359
hp officejet pro it will look for it and

500
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,640
if it finds one

501
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,839
it will try to connect automatically

502
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,280
with username and password

503
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,640
right again it's a way of

504
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,919
detecting the devices online is it

505
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,039
useful for them

506
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
it's marginally useful i mean it shows

507
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,039
interest it shows that people want to

508
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,480
own this uh

509
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,400
these uh printers uh with what intent

510
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,320
i i couldn't say there's no clear

511
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,679
monetization plan

512
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,760
and plan there's no way of making money

513
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,120
off of those infections

514
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,360
immediately with with these tools

515
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
again lots of interest right we see in

516
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,679
the spanish speaking underground

517
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,640
somebody was doing google dork to find

518
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,039
the

519
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,000
online refrigeration systems like

520
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
industrial refrigeration systems

521
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,640
that were open in this one you use that

522
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,200
dork

523
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
you get into a refrigerator system what

524
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
do you do with that i have no idea you

525
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,919
can lower the temperature or up the

526
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,720
temperature

527
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,799
i don't know marginally useful again it

528
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,840
shows interest

529
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,799
it doesn't show uh actual intent

530
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,240
uh the arabic speaking underground is

531
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,120
pretty much the same

532
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,360
right the very low sophistication and

533
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
this one this is a translation right

534
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,039
the image is the original but the rest

535
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,799
is a translation uh it's

536
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,200
it it's pretty much telling you that

537
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
there are tutorials on how to break into

538
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
cameras

539
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,880
but again it doesn't say what to do with

540
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,679
them you know

541
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,360
if you find a good camera then you'll be

542
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,440
able to look at a swimming pool right

543
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,640
okay no there's no monetization plan

544
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,520
way way way different than that russian

545
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,640
plan

546
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,679
trying to break over packetize them and

547
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,120
sell channels uh like

548
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,440
netflix completely different environment

549
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,160
this one

550
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,039
is just the technical how to this is how

551
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,440
you

552
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,000
try to break a camera period that's

553
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,280
where they stop

554
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,440
another one there right this is a whole

555
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,400
translation

556
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,880
uh how to hack you know penetration

557
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,160
cameras

558
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,799
how to do penetration testing on uh

559
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,240
online camps

560
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
okay marginally useful not really a show

561
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,360
of intent so what

562
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,679
we're saying here is that these people

563
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,720
do have uh or they're amassing

564
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,760
the knowledge they have the interest

565
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,120
to start attacking iot devices all sorts

566
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
of devices there's interest in a lot of

567
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,440
devices

568
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,559
we're seeing uh mostly uh

569
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,520
routers and cameras but also all sorts

570
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:49,919
of

571
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,679
very strange devices right every time

572
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,200
that there's a new vulnerability on

573
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,320
x device somebody will will try to

574
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
create a tutorial on how to own it but

575
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
in reality hackers

576
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
do not um try to attack just because

577
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,080
they can right it's good to try and

578
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,960
attack uh

579
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,200
just because you can once but you're not

580
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,559
going to keep attacking

581
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,559
if there's no way of making money out of

582
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,679
it and

583
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,280
what we're seeing is that they are

584
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,360
developing mostly in russia

585
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
in the russian underground they are

586
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,760
developing very clear monetization plans

587
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,000
for making money off of infected routers

588
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,440
same path a little bit behind it's under

589
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,919
brazilian underground they have created

590
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,480
some

591
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,960
money some monetization plan for making

592
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,880
money off of routers also

593
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
the rest of the undergrounds completely

594
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,440
completely behind

595
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,880
as to what pertains to attacking routers

596
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,320
they know how

597
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
they're sharing how they they are

598
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
technical enough to know

599
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
what kind of uh attacks can be performed

600
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
but they have not figured out any

601
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,559
monetization plan therefore

602
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,200
hackers from those environments uh we

603
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
can only assume that they're trying to

604
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,159
attack

605
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,039
just for kicks just for fun but uh we

606
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,039
don't see any concerted effort

607
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,360
that that is going to be successful in

608
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,159
the long term

609
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,159
unless they find a real clear

610
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,120
monetization plan this is my bottom line

611
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,280
so you have routers and other devices

612
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,559
they they can

613
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,240
and they will be attacked so if you own

614
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,720
a sizeable amount of them you have to

615
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
start devising a plan

616
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
in order to protect them they will be

617
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
attacked there is a clear

618
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,799
intent there is a clear monetization

619
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,159
plan to make money

620
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,880
off of those attacks therefore those

621
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
attacks will keep going and will keep

622
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
increasing as other hackers know what to

623
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,440
what how to make money off of those

624
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,200
your barbie dolls i think they're safe

625
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,039
for the moment

626
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:58,880
thank you jenguya barzo

627
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,960
you
