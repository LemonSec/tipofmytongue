so again thank you so much for me here

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
and it's a pleasure for me to talk in a

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,000
confidence

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,160
as i mentioned before i i lived in

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,680
poland during one year

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,640
and it's a pleasure to me to talk in

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,920
this conference now

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
so today we are talking in this talk

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,040
and devoting an exploitation docker

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,160
environment

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,880
so i think either introduce me but this

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,760
is my

if you can try uh you know

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,640
follow me basically i am

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,879
i have a curiosity in my career because

was a salesperson it's totally crazy yes

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,359
i think in 2000 maybe

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,280
but i work in a sales in the industry of

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,400
technology of course

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,760
and in 2013

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,360
i changed to the technical uh career

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
sounds like crazy i know and i worked in

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,240
adele computers and trained micro

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,119
and in nepal in poland and now i am i'm

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,360
working in uh in zoop innovation this is

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,880
a company it's like a software house

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,640
here in brazil

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,200
is to you know and a good interesting

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,119
about the soup innovation this company

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,280
build and create and develop many

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,799
software you know

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
open source softwares and you can

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
probably you can in the future

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,560
very a lot about this company about the

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,680
rich product

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,920
and bigo and many products that my

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,799
company

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,920
are development development okay so

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
i'm working now not now i think it's

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
three years in a hacker sector like uh

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,640
research

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,920
it's the same case and i i

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
have a pleasure to publish some uh

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,439
articles

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,399
not uh you know when i have um not like

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:02,880
uh

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,479
it's like a mission but my idea is to

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,000
to try creating in a basis from this

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,879
you know that the young guys or to talk

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,720
about the the bases you know

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,760
so i'm i'm writing i'm wroting actually

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
some articles

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,120
uh about them our analysis about the

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,720
penetration testing

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,360
uh about the same techniques uh

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
inference you have

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,080
some tools that you can use for example

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,760
so this is i published these articles in

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,599
this in this magazines

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,760
and this is another uh this is the

66
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,400
one cv that i receive it's very simple

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
as i mentioned in either before

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,640
because you know this is the i think

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,000
many many people that

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
that was looking now know this equipment

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
this is equipment is it sell in in

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,840
poland

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,879
in germany and probably in czech

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,159
republic

75
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,360
uh and i i found on a cv it's a simple

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
cv i know

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,840
but you know it's i found it basically

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,120
and i reported this for this company uh

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,879
in this company it's the same case when

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,560
you talk about the security okay it's

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,879
not

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
totally high i know but uh

83
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,319
the point here it's many times this

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,000
product it's a router

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,200
and this product is it's sell

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,680
in a small business company that's a big

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,400
problem

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,959
because if you can get the

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,040
administration access you you just need

90
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
to be in the same

91
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,560
network and you can you know you can get

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,319
the the administration access and you

93
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,799
can manipulate all the access in the

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,519
administration so uh that's the point

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:41,920
okay

96
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,560
so this is the agenda today before

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,200
talking

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,760
uh more deeply in uh pivoting techniques

99
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,480
i need to

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,360
put it everywhere in the same everybody

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
in the same page

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
i think because you know here in the

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,080
conference we have a people

104
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
probably know about the this defense

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
team or the st of the marine ali so

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,159
my idea here is putting everybody in the

107
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,959
same page

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,120
right so you talk about the who what is

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,159
a fantastic

110
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,080
uh after that executing because you know

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,879
for i need when do you as a creating a

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,760
pentesting

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,880
the pivoting it's a technique uh in

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,440
another phase in a post exploitation in

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,199
the technique of the fantastic

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
so i i am i am doing uh step by step

117
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,240
here of this

118
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,479
uh technique until you arrive in the

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,840
pivoting technique in the end of the

120
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,320
question

121
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,960
right so the first of all what is a pen

122
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
testing i think it's

123
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,960
it's very no for everyone it's uh

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,360
security testing in um

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,919
today in the in the the company can you

126
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,560
know

127
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,759
uh hearing by many uh

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,880
different partners or companies it's a

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,320
simulate of the real world attack yes

130
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,120
uh and you can try hacking for example

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,080
some

132
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,680
applications some apps like a mobile

133
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
applications for example you can try for

134
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,360
example

135
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,479
exploiting a physical place

136
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,759
you can try many uh systems you can

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,479
uh try for example in the network by the

138
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,160
way the pivoting techniques

139
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,520
uh has or are passed in the network

140
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
it's a technique involved right

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
so basically the penetration testing

142
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
it's a simulate of the hacker attack

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,759
right

144
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,880
this is the very simple so you have a uh

145
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,600
some types or service during the when

146
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,320
the guy

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,639
could be executing this fantastic first

148
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,000
of all it's black box it's

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
like a similar uh totally uh using by

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,080
hacker

151
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
you know it's uh when the people don't

152
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,120
have

153
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,360
any information of this company for

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
example the people just

155
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
have the philippe company name and

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,000
that's to it so the guy needs to

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,840
understand how this company uh works

158
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
what this company sell or not sell who

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,520
is

160
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,759
uh this company so then you probably

161
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,800
need to to

162
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
research or or search some information

163
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,479
in a google or

164
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
internet to understand if if this

165
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
company have internet or

166
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,560
or extranet or you know or information

167
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
in a github

168
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
the the first step is the recognization

169
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
yes so this is the black box when the

170
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,479
guy don't have

171
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,319
any information of the company just the

172
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,319
name okay and white boxes

173
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,560
it's different when the guy for example

174
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
has uh

175
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,240
information of the company like now you

176
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,039
need to

177
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,680
exploit for example this app or my

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,639
e-commerce

179
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
application or you need to try

180
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
exploitation my api

181
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,720
from this app or you need to explain

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
you can exploit for example this range

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,840
of the

184
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,680
ips you know so usually we have a scope

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,319
to try exploit it's very simple you have

186
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:52,880
the all

187
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
informations and it's the mix set of

188
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,919
these this

189
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
uh services the gray box you know and

190
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,479
you have some information

191
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,800
and but not totally for example maybe

192
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,440
or sometimes when you work with a

193
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,160
fantastic

194
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,800
or like a red team because that's a very

195
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,720
interesting because today

196
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,080
many companies in a world uh

197
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
doing some confusing when you talk a

198
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
fantastic and a red team it's

199
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,360
it's almost maybe maybe similar but

200
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,639
totally different

201
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,720
you know penetration testing in our

202
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,639
action that will be executed in ready

203
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,400
team and you have a many person

204
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,639
or many people inside the team with

205
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,000
different skills

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,759
and you can you will be you you know

207
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
create many different strategy

208
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,560
methodologies to implementing it

209
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,599
and of course you will create many uh

210
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,479
deeply

211
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,360
uh hacking actions in this environment

212
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,759
so

213
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,800
gray box uh it's a mixing uh

214
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,840
that it that is you have uh for example

215
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
um

216
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,599
uh some information of this company you

217
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,440
know this company for example

218
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
sell um you know uh some machines for

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,319
the industry

220
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,599
you can know about for example the

221
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,360
the this company has uh an apis

222
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,639
and this company has for example an um

223
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,280
applications web applications you

224
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
receive some information but

225
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,039
not all informations right so this is

226
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,800
the mixing of this service on this

227
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,560
the first basically this is the three uh

228
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,599
types of the pen testing right so now

229
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,559
uh after this simple explanation are you

230
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,799
executing this penetration testing

231
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,240
uh in this environment when i uh created

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
this presentation

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,640
i was work i work it in in poland and i

234
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:44,959
have

235
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,600
this challenge in a hack-the-box

236
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,560
environment

237
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,240
uh by the way this machine don't

238
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,279
don't have it don't are in a in upping

239
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,120
now it's it's removed so it's not a

240
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,680
problem i

241
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,800
i don't show the the the rashes of the

242
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
information but

243
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,279
the the good thing here is the technique

244
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,080
that i will use that some points in

245
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,880
interesting

246
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,760
right so the first of first of the the

247
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,640
steps

248
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
that i can do in the penetration test it

249
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
can be like uh you know like a

250
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
methodology can implementing when you

251
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,959
executing something fantastic

252
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,320
not just in um a hack the box of course

253
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
you can use

254
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
but you this is the the same process

255
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,440
that that you can use for example in a

256
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
in a company that service you can doing

257
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,080
or you company that to we work it

258
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
the first of all is it's patas i think

259
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,839
it's very no for for everyone

260
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
penetration test execution is standard

261
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,080
you have

262
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
seven uh steps to do and another it's

263
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,399
oasp

264
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
uh open web application security

265
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,160
projects it's open search project

266
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,040
it's our organization and the focus in

267
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,399
our open source products

268
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,720
products and application you can you

269
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,519
know

270
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,680
stay together with this organization and

271
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,200
you can you know grow

272
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
more this organization it's very very

273
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,839
very interesting when you talk

274
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,399
about the web application when you talk

275
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,519
about penetration testing

276
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,480
application focus right so in another

277
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,560
one it's a wasp top 10 of course it's

278
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
it's some steps that you can realize

279
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,920
usually in a

280
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,040
web application maybe in and uh

281
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,440
you can try exploit it when the focus in

282
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
a web application right

283
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
okay so when you need to uh or when you

284
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,680
go

285
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,959
when you're gonna to do any

286
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,680
penetration testing in a web environment

287
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,959
the first of all to

288
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,320
need to re you know to recall of this

289
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
environment or i think it's the most

290
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
important when you

291
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,279
make when you do this the fantastic is

292
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,560
to enumerate

293
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
the information because when you when

294
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,920
you get to do

295
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
uh many steps when you go when you get

296
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,839
to understand

297
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,760
every uh things in environment

298
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,480
after that the exploitation it sounds

299
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,279
not simple

300
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,399
i know but you know it's more clear or

301
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,360
what the application you can exploit for

302
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,320
example so now

303
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,920
i will using of course the demo because

304
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,560
i

305
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
i you need to pray and the lords of god

306
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,640
of demos you know it's

307
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,600
probably you get a problem so i i record

308
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:21,920
the

309
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,800
the demo so first of all i you know i

310
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,160
basically i

311
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,959
i need to recall this this website you

312
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,519
know

313
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,120
it's very interesting because i am in

314
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
the the class b here you know

315
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,640
it's uh i am in the

316
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,399
it does not work the first of all to

317
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,079
understand how this

318
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,120
uh web page works and you can see here

319
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,839
below

320
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,760
i think you can he you can see the

321
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,000
index.html

322
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,880
you can see here blog so many times in

323
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,200
the blog probably we have the articles

324
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,440
sometimes you can use the sql injection

325
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,720
in articles

326
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
maybe so i am i'm i'm you know i am

327
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,560
trying to recon this application and you

328
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,279
can and put the the mouse here

329
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,839
uh of the the the image and

330
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,600
usually redirections through the same

331
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,079
page

332
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
but not you know when you talk about the

333
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,600
contacts in blocks so

334
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
another point here you contact the

335
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,959
people that was

336
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,160
uh that are watching me probably no

337
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,760
contact form maybe

338
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
you can using some you know

339
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,720
uh xxs um exploitation or something like

340
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,600
that so

341
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,480
i am trying to find or to looking it's a

342
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,200
simple

343
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,839
simple uh observation of this website so

344
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,560
first of all

345
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,240
i i found this port 22

346
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
open here we found the the version of

347
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,600
the

348
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
open ssh the version of the

349
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,600
ubuntu and here i found another you know

350
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
if you can see here

351
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
another different port so here it sounds

352
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,959
very interesting because

353
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,839
you know you can see here one of the the

354
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,800
standard port

355
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,839
in ssh in an ssh

356
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,120
and below you can see another

357
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
you know another port with the same

358
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,120
service

359
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,399
of course probably maybe it's the same

360
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,680
server or not maybe i can i can have

361
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,000
another because you know it's the same

362
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
port

363
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
it's the same service but you know the

364
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
port is different port so it's very

365
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,639
you need to look in and think about it

366
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,480
you know so here i have another

367
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,440
uh another port eight eight but here i i

368
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,720
have a tomcat in

369
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
in if you see below here uh

370
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,959
above no not below above here you can

371
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,639
see just a patch in a

372
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,000
different version right so after that i

373
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,560
can

374
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,000
looking of this application that's a a

375
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,639
good point

376
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,920
here because you can explore more this

377
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
environment right

378
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,880
so okay so the next steps

379
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,000
i'm gonna look in this application h8

380
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,639
here it's a very interesting point

381
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,000
because when you executed in a

382
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,480
penetration testing many times you can

383
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,560
find you can found you can find it so

384
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,040
if you can see here in this demo i using

385
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
the standard password

386
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,480
right adenine anatomy if you can see

387
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,440
wow it's it's crazy you know because

388
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,760
it's

389
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,240
it's happened in many companies not just

390
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,399
a admin admin admin

391
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,519
but if you install some another

392
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,560
application when the guy will install

393
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,079
or maybe uh if you look in the past

394
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,839
many times when i install some demos or

395
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,839
or poc or poc concept in in many

396
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,279
companies and after you know

397
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,920
uh i think six months or one year after

398
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
i i return it to this company

399
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,760
uh and if many times if this company uh

400
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,040
bought the solution security and i i

401
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
you know i just doing looking the the

402
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,800
settings if

403
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,120
the uh implementation a good best

404
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,079
practices

405
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,959
and when did the guy put in the the

406
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,680
password

407
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,800
many guys many times and i the the

408
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,680
you know the local guy uh told me or

409
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,320
said me

410
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
man i need to change the password

411
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,360
because the password is the same that

412
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,480
you put in the plc you can imagine that

413
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,120
it's

414
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
it's totally crazy crazy in normal if

415
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,320
you can see

416
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,040
so here we can look in the upload image

417
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,760
so here

418
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,560
probably or or not i can use this uh

419
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,839
this uh option maybe

420
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,079
to exploit because when you executing a

421
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,440
penetration testing

422
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,639
when you have this upload uh

423
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,759
button you can upload the image if you

424
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,079
if you see if if you know for example

425
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,600
you can upload this information this

426
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,320
information

427
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,519
it sends it to a database and you can

428
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,279
receive the answer from the database

429
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,399
right so that's a good point interesting

430
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,480
because you can execute a remote code

431
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,839
execution it's an

432
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,480
one technique that you can uh you can

433
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:04,880
get

434
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,360
the reverse shell in the environment

435
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,000
right

436
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,279
so okay but i just can't upload the zip

437
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,079
file and

438
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,360
image file right so i i continue to look

439
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,639
in the all

440
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,120
pages that this web application have

441
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,040
or had in this case because in the past

442
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,240
when executed this

443
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,079
penetration test right so and i looking

444
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,199
some information and to continue to

445
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,160
investigate

446
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,199
after that uh i'm gonna to

447
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,480
understand if this webpage has

448
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,759
um another directory right i

449
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,199
i could use for example uh another tool

450
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,160
or i can look in the the sub domains but

451
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,720
in this case i i just find it to the

452
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,959
uh i use w fuzz actually

453
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,480
and to try and find find uh

454
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,959
any directors in this case so i'll be

455
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,079
putting

456
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,799
in front to gain that between time here

457
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,230
so

458
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,880
[Music]

459
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,640
if you can see i will put the wrong

460
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,240
because it's the real life

461
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
right i mean when you put in the

462
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,880
when it's a cute you can receive the

463
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,760
error like this error you know i put i

464
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,679
i forgot to put in the slash in the

465
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,359
first so

466
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,160
this is the real life right so here the

467
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,959
first of all i received the archives

468
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,720
directory so that i can look in this

469
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
because i received the 31

470
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,559
response uh this is the response of the

471
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,679
server you know

472
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,840
it's the response to when you try access

473
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,360
the web application and the

474
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,600
the in the web application the http

475
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
protocol returned to

476
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,120
some information and i received another

477
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,320
information here

478
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,799
then uploads and user so i will try to

479
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,480
to look in and to find

480
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,200
some information the first of all our

481
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,760
chiefs

482
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,240
and here i don't have a permission but

483
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
if you can see

484
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,080
let me check another uploads users

485
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,559
um images so we have many options to try

486
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,600
access so the good point here if you

487
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
can you know think about it oops

488
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,760
i pass i will show you some information

489
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,640
here it's very

490
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,440
important here because i try to access

491
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,840
the

492
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
achieves and after that i try to access

493
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,360
image right

494
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,679
so but i received the forbidden access

495
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,520
because i don't have a permission right

496
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,400
so until here it's everything okay

497
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,520
because

498
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,400
probably the guy when applica and apply

499
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,520
the software

500
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,120
the security software and the security

501
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,799
policies put in the good

502
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,000
uh policies but if you can see here

503
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,480
you can see the the version of the

504
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,520
apache

505
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
you can see here the version of the

506
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,520
server so this

507
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,120
you know it's not good because here the

508
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,679
penetration tester guy or the bad guy

509
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,720
like a hacker

510
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,000
can can try to find any exploit with

511
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,799
this version

512
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,200
right because now i know that this

513
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
application has this version

514
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,559
of course i know when i executed any

515
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,080
mafia i received the same

516
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,400
information but supposed to this guy

517
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,080
don't have this information

518
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,919
now here in web application when you

519
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,440
receive zero that's a

520
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,480
ah another point right

521
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,280
so here the image it has i mentioned

522
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,880
before

523
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,360
the same error and i have a users so

524
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,280
when you try put here the users

525
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,400
i have here hdr page users from user

526
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,200
three members

527
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,400
logging right so i will i'm trying here

528
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,360
i was trying here the same standard

529
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,480
password

530
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,559
if i am looking here if i was looking at

531
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,919
this guy in this case

532
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,039
at me and the meaning bam though

533
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,679
i don't receive in the same case i try

534
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,160
root

535
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,320
and no i don't have access in this case

536
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,760
so i need to try

537
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,880
exploit or explore another

538
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
thing in this page right so i will using

539
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
another because when you

540
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,080
when usually when i try to when i need

541
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,880
to take some

542
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,080
um i need not need to but

543
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,480
if i need to to do for example any pen

544
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,360
testing

545
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,960
or you know when i look when i'm working

546
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,240
in a red team here in soup usually i

547
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,360
i like to use three or four uh

548
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,159
tools with the same action you know

549
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,080
because i like to compare this

550
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,640
this tools and here i represent you i

551
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
think many people

552
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,440
uh know this uh this tool it's it's the

553
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,080
burster

554
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,840
it's from oh ask you i mentioned in the

555
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
beginning of this presentation

556
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,000
so i basically i have executed this

557
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,120
information i received

558
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,720
a report because here

559
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,520
as you can see i received another

560
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
information from the same webpage here i

561
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,320
found the similar information

562
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,000
right and i received another information

563
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
of the secret.php

564
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,000
here we have we have a new new page new

565
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
information it's very interesting so

566
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,520
let's see this page because it's not

567
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,960
because a secret but

568
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,080
maybe can be interesting so here

569
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,360
as you can see we have a conversation

570
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,000
right and you can see here the chat is

571
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
unavailable at the moment

572
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,559
probably you know i am supposed here

573
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,240
in this case probably this is the chat

574
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,559
of the maybe support team

575
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,919
and this guy talked before

576
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,120
and probably the application make a

577
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,840
print

578
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,320
a print screen and you know save in that

579
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,960
in any database inside the server right

580
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
so here let's reach the conversation the

581
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,280
first of all it's

582
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,240

re or rca it's uh

590
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,559
it means uh remote code execution it's

591
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,360
interesting for

592
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,960
our penetration test right so what's the

593
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,159
web dev doing or what's this guy

598
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,320
it's not correct

599
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,000
i know okay so also please replace the

600
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,520
file service with

601
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,559
a zap yes because you know you can

602
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,159
imagine this conversation because here

603
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,200
we have a three

604
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,240
guys and here we have a ato we

605
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
actually here we have um four guys

606
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,159
and here we can find another information

607
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,520
because here we can see the

608
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,039
rash and and here

609
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,480
we here we can see very interesting

610
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
information but you can you can note

611
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,919
deeply here you can look in deeply here

612
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,400
because

613
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,960
if you can read here or it's impossible

614
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,520
to get

615
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,000
into our server this is the answer of

616
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,880
the neuro

617
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
right and before ccg tries uh

618
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,799
i will check in the ip logs and eat them

619
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,679
right

620
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,240
okay by the way connect i needed the

621
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,120
access for

622
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,320
your remote server right because if you

623
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,159
can look in this conversation this guy

624
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,440
are talking uh was

625
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,000
we're talking of the probably remote

626
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,280
cause execution in

627
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,480
in in in in that environment right so

628
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,200
but here

629
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,720
nora requested to connect uh remote

630
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
access

631
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,840
because probably this guy the name of

632
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,760
connect this guy has

633
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
the you know like uh

634
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,559
a super user or root or admin access

635
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,080
right

636
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,279
if you can looking the first act

637
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,039
insert of this guy you can know you can

638
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,640
oh my goodness let me return here

639
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,760
you can looking here the very

640
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,200
interesting information because the

641
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,240
question

642
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,679
or the request in this case from noro is

643
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,919
i needed the access for your remote

644
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,400
server if you can think about it

645
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,279
when you in the company suppose i am at

646
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,080
the

647
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,640
for example i am a support guy and i

648
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,279
have

649
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,600
all ips information ip address

650
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,480
information

651
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,240
and let's suppose an either has

652
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,600
administration access and but i i have

653
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,039
the ip address from

654
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,559
either right but i don't have the

655
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,480
password right because

656
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
if i am responsible to all ip address i

657
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
have all ipads for all of them

658
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,840
in my company but i don't have the

659
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,279
password from

660
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,520
either for example i am using either it

661
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,320
i think it's

662
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,279
i don't don't no no no problem right so

663
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,480
the first answer

664
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
from connect is i love the token and

665
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,960
putting like a you know like a heart

666
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,880
here

667
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,520
and when i look at it i i could supposed

668
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,520
maybe this information is a password

669
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,799
why because the guy requested here the

670
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,440
access

671
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,880
but they but he has the ip address

672
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,559
information but don't have the password

673
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,960
and here is the password in this case

674
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
it's the password right

675
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,520
so that's very interesting point so here

676
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
if you can compare you have here in the

677
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,039
secret page

678
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,360
the conversations from guy and another

679
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,039
page we have a member

680
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,559
areas so i now i can try to exploit this

681
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,039
page

682
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,200
right so okay so

683
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,960
let me continue i am fine i'm found

684
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,320
in um an upload a button

685
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,559
in one of this application right so i i

686
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,440
built this

687
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,919
the shell because i am trying to exploit

688
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,799
this

689
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,000
application a simple php file

690
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
and i created it's a basically

691
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,960
steps but here you can see i just have

692
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,720
a shell php file but i just can

693
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,159
uploaded a zip file and an image file

694
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,799
but when i tried to exploit this

695
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,400
information i knew

696
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
that we have this vulnerability zip

697
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,559
sleeping vulnerability i think it's

698
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,840
if you can uh the people was the people

699
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,080
are

700
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
watching now they know this

701
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,279
vulnerability that's an interesting

702
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,480
vulnerability

703
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,679
so here i was explaining so zip slippage

704
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,000
was

705
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,240
a spread a critical achieve extraction

706
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,320
vulnerabilities allows attackers

707
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,720
like me to write arbitrary files on the

708
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
system typically resulting the remote

709
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,880
remote code execution that's my

710
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,919
objective now

711
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,880
right so the vulnerability is exploited

712
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,640
using a special crafted

713
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,919
achieved holds director transversal file

714
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,480
it's a

715
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,200
very interesting technique you can put

716
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,679
slash

717
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,799
dot dot slash like like dosh

718
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,440
doc doc slash and you can access the

719
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,640
web server as you can see

720
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,679
here below you just need to create a

721
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,640
zip evo and you can find this

722
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,600
information

723
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,799
so we if you can search in the in the

724
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,080
internet you can find

725
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,360
in the everlak github

726
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,120
we have the the code responsible to do

727
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,520
it

728
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,960
and you can try to find here right so uh

729
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,240
when i when i get what i am

730
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,080
doing after this uh phase right i

731
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,279
download this overlock right and i

732
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,799
created this

733
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,159
using the python everlike shell php

734
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,840
and i using the unix systems operation

735
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,440
because you know it's ubuntu

736
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,720
and i set the the path

737
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,120
of the web server right so this is the

738
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,640
technique of the traversal

739
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,240
path right so var www.html and shell.php

740
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,480
and this tool is responsible to create

741
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,399
a zip file right so here i have why what

742
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,480
i have a zip file that i can upload

743
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,320
in a uh environment after that i upload

744
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,679
this information

745
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,080
and i have the

746
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,279
access to the environment it's very very

747
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,039
simple right i have just a command

748
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,480
execution

749
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,200
in the in the server so i can look in

750
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,080
the ip

751
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,159
if you can see here we have another

752
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,080
class of the ip address

753
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,919
right because i am accessing the first

754
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,120
of all the class a

755
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,240
and here i have a class b right so it's

756
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,159
very interesting point because i have in

757
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,840
two different classes here

758
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,559
right so the next steps i try to look in

759
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,200
the

760
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,399
the version of the server and

761
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,440
here i just look in there my wonderful

762
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,080
shell

763
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,919
my my friendship.php and here we can see

764
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,840
the secret.php

765
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,080
and uploads and i try to access but i

766
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,360
received the forbidden

767
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,760
it then users that i can access but i

768
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,360
don't have a password

769
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,799
and i'm looking here the index.html

770
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,679
and contact.hmm so we have many

771
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,360
information

772
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
as you can see here this is in for this

773
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,000
all these informations are in the

774
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
the main server right okay

775
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,120
so if i can you know manipulate some uh

776
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,919
information here i can try to to get the

777
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,799
reverse shell

778
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,840
right so by the way i opened the netcat

779
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,799
because i find

780
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,520
i found this this tool inside the server

781
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,159
right

782
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,240
and i is including the remote server and

783
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,919
execution and this

784
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,960
and this and and this phase

785
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,159
i find this interesting information it's

786
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:44,880
docker

787
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,480
envy so here i look at and i

788
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,040
started to think man

789
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,919
[Music]

790
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,120
when i am doing here in this environment

791
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,640
because you know

792
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,679
as you can see when you when you try to

793
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,600
do the pen testing usually you you don't

794
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,159
you don't know where or how is this

795
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,120
environment

796
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,960
so you need to understand and you need

797
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,320
of course you need to

798
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,760
many times you need to stop the the

799
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,559
pentax you need to study more a lot

800
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,760
of course maybe supposedly if you

801
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,200
for example if when you try to exploit

802
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,159
in one environment

803
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,200
if you imagine if you access the

804
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,520
the web server in you and you access

805
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,720
inside the server

806
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,000
and you find it you know the different

807
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,679
systems operation like uh

808
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,720
you know freebase the bsd or

809
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,039
i don't know another uh old you know

810
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,120
system operation it's a big challenge so

811
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,960
here i am

812
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,159
looking inside the uh environment

813
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,440
and i look in here i find the same

814
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,840
secret.php

815
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,760
and i use php right so

816
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,480
after that the next step that i was

817
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,279
doing this case is when i uploaded this

818
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,120
information my show

819
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,799
i i the interesting point is i can

820
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,320
upload information

821
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,360
like uh you know like uh uh

822
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,640
um with a a good privilege in the

823
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,480
web page so if i have for example

824
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,840
when i upload i have a good uh

825
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,399
you know privilege when i upload some

826
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,159
files inside

827
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,000
the web server i can try for example to

828
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,519
to uh upload my you know my key

829
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,440
inside my private key inside this

830
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,279
environment so that's the next step

831
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,559
that's why i was doing i created an uh

832
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,679
this key chain this this key the key the

833
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,000
number

834
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,799
of the key hacker it's um you know it's

835
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,240
uh

836
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,120
the common name and i i do the same

837
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,000
process

838
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,399
of the the using the overlock

839
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,679
2 and i created here if you can see

840
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:04,559
python.2.7 ever like

841
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,799
doc pi this is the two and this is the

842
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,840
unix

843
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,799
systems operation right and here the

844
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,600
path

845
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,720
that i was is uploaded this information

846
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,919
because i sat

847
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,720
where i will uploaded this information

848
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,480
that's very interesting because

849
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,799
you know i this is the vulnerability zip

850
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,480
slip that i was explored

851
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,640
right and here i uploaded my private key

852
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,000
my authorizat key

853
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,039
inside the root server as you can see

854
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,159
here and after that i upload this

855
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,559
information environment and i try access

856
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,880
by acsg

857
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,240
with my personal my private in this case

858
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,519
to if you can see here i have a

859
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,799
root user right so before when i

860
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,720
exploited i just having the

861
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,320
you know www data it's a lot

862
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,120
like a a web a web access not a root

863
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,559
access or not a user

864
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,000
so here i have and i i get the user

865
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,440
access right so after that

866
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,960
we can executing this technique the

867
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,559
pivoting technique because i am

868
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,200
inside the environment so this technique

869
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,080
it's a

870
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,600
post exploitation right so when

871
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,360
when i when i get the access inside the

872
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,720
my victim for example and

873
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,320
i need to looking around me around this

874
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,919
machine how this works in this

875
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,200
environment right

876
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,399
so this is the next step but because

877
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,320
if you can note before you can see

878
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,440
before

879
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,480
the first uh network that i was

880
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,200
trying access is the class a you know

881
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,880
it's the range of 10

882
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,480
and after that when i when i uh

883
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,279
go to inside the web server i am in the

884
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,159
class

885
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,760
two plus b sorry 172 right

886
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,799
so what is pivoting technique uh i wrote

887
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,840
an um

888
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,480
a similar article about this topic and

889
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,240
it's very interesting if you can

890
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,760
uh read before this article uh

891
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,719
i created a lab in uh in my environment

892
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,480
it's not the same because i created this

893
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,079
lab i created a

894
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,359
uh a machine in the in in

895
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,079
different uh systems operation with unix

896
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,119
systems operation

897
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,719
and i created a debian and with this

898
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,320
debian uninstall docker

899
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,079
and export the docker environment so

900
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,239
it's it's the similar but not

901
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,320
the same but you can you can copy this

902
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,040
my lab in this article you can reproduce

903
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,359
this

904
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,320
attack you can try reproduce it okay so

905
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,079
pivoting is the use of the first

906
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,280
compromised system right so as

907
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,320
i uh i did in this presentation

908
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,159
right so you can uh using this technique

909
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,320
to to routing uh or to find a protocol

910
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,520
to try and ex exploit in a application

911
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,320
lab

912
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,599
level uh that is it's

913
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,440
it's allowed to pass or to growing

914
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,240
inside

915
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,520
your vitamin network right so in other

916
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,320
words

917
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,440
uh you need basically you are inside

918
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,119
you can move lateral uh you can using in

919
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,839
movement

920
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,839
in lateral movement inside this company

921
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,960
it's like a jumpy

922
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,000
right because you know you are in a

923
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,320
maybe in the class c in your in your

924
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,440
environment you are

925
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,720
192 uh ip address

926
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,920
you can try access the class a but you

927
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,200
find another class b

928
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,680
inside the company you can find another

929
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,839
range of this the same network

930
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,880
for example 172

931
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,800
dog 18 but you can find another range in

932
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,440
8 172 and 25 for example so how it's

933
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,560
possible to

934
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,680
access this network

935
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,320
but how it's possible because you you

936
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
don't have access in this in this level

937
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,960
right because

938
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,440
you are in the class c and you are

939
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,800
outside of the company

940
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,200
so the pivoting techniques you can use

941
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,920
this in

942
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,119
this environment so you can imagine how

943
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,160
you can explode exploit it

944
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,480
in the docker environment because you in

945
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,800
the document you have the same engine

946
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,200
you know and you have a docker engine

947
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,960
you have many different stockers

948
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,920
or many different containers you know

949
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,680
you have a many networks

950
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
so it's very interesting very important

951
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,280
technique that could be used in the in

952
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,480
the penetration test

953
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,400
right so here i will start to execute

954
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,240
this technique it's not a complicated

955
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,760
technique but you you have many

956
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,520
ways to execute it so here i access the

957
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,880
connect key because i

958
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,880
uh when i had the root access i find

959
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,560
this i found the this axis so after that

960
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,040
i

961
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,320
i i exploit this environment so now here

962
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,680
as you can see i found the

963
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,599
class p 172

964
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,720
yes so here i found this information

965
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,359
in this network right okay so are you

966
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,079
looking this

967
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,359
notes information so here i have a

968
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,720
a very interesting information whenever

969
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,440
vulnerabilities gogs was detected

970
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,119
i shut down the registration function on

971
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,960
server please ensure

972
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,079
that no one gets access to the test

973
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,000
account look at it look at that

974
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,520
please ensure that no one gets access to

975
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,240
the test

976
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,520
account so here i can supposed

977
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,040
maybe we can try found

978
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,200
we can try and find this test account

979
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,480
because here in this note you know

980
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,079
if you're working with the server many

981
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,000
times you create an a note

982
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,880
a notes doc text file or you know you

983
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,839
write you wrote

984
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,920
or you write something in your server

985
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,760
you can write some notes right

986
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,320
because i need to do this task before or

987
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,520
anytime you send in your

988
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,480
personal email a private email or before

989
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
the next wednesday i need to

990
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
update this this application because

991
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,400
this application was vulnerable

992
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
blah blah blah and you put in these

993
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,520
notes so here in this case

994
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,839
the probably the guy right this guy do

995
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,119
you remember connect

996
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,960
when the neuro requests the access from

997
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,280
this guy man i need to access your

998
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,839
remote server and this guy

999
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,280
answered with the password so this guy

1000
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,680
wrote something in this note right and

1001
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,599
here we have another application blogs

1002
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,480
it's a similar

1003
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,599
uh a github and an and a another this

1004
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,640
kind of platform

1005
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,359
right so here i i have a test account

1006
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,760
it's a interesting point

1007
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,079
so okay let's continue to look in this

1008
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,200
machine and what is this

1009
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,200
um you know this user has so we have

1010
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,240
an information i've set up a file server

1011
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,400
into the server network etho if you need

1012
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,640
to transfer file to the server

1013
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,160
can use my pc

1014
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,480
dm me for the access okay so here

1015
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
maybe i have interesting information

1016
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,079
because another

1017
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,960
you know another like a breach not a

1018
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,160
breach but you know

1019
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,200
like a fail because this

1020
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,560
amazing guy write or

1021
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,040
wrote another information from this

1022
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,839
another guy

1023
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,400
ato right here right here

1024
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,839
let me check here use my pc

1025
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,240
i can you can i can suppose we have a

1026
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,040
test account

1027
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,560
and here i have a pc so maybe this guy

1028
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,240
has another account

1029
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,079
right and uh maybe uh a pc account so

1030
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,119
let's continue to

1031
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,359
to read all the information that we have

1032
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,839
here in this environment right

1033
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,599
so i will try to look in the ssh file

1034
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,480
and here i

1035
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,839
look in the some keys and

1036
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,720
here here oh look at look at look at it

1037
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,240
here i have a connect uh connect pub

1038
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,440
right in here you can see that the

1039
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,000
the the dom like a domain you know you

1040
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,800
can see here

1041
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,839
they access the connect

1042
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,720
connect pc but here you can look it's

1043
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,920
another key

1044
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
right so two different key here it's

1045
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,359
connect agery

1046
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,400
and here you can find connect pc so

1047
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,480
if you can think uh

1048
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,200
about this this penetration testing uh

1049
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,760
here

1050
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,800
probably this is the account test

1051
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
that this guy mentioned before right

1052
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,280
because it's when you talk to eto

1053
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,640
he mentioned what he mentioned my

1054
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,280
pc so he he's a connect you see probably

1055
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,680
the

1056
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,319
private pc from this guy probably this

1057
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:58,960
is a

1058
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,200
test account for the environment right

1059
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,280
so here we we can find

1060
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,200
many information of the environment

1061
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,560
right so

1062
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,280
do you remember or remember that i need

1063
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,400
to

1064
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,599
get the movement or lateral movement

1065
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,839
inside the company right

1066
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,880
so here i will in this

1067
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,520
another demo i will try to find another

1068
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,480
information

1069
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,040
from this the same guy because as you

1070
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,760
can see here in kaneki this guy has a

1071
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,560
many

1072
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,520
access or many privileged so here this

1073
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,680
amazing guy again

1074
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,040
is a good a fail process because he

1075
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,720
uh save all this uh

1076
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,040
information inside the server as you can

1077
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,000
see here

1078
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,520
i access the connect pc

1079
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,960
the private account this is the what is

1080
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,079
this this is the

1081
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,680
test account if and here

1082
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,720
it's the very interesting point

1083
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,400
because here we find

1084
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,319
or i found actually the same network

1085
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,040
172.20

1086
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,119
but i found another

1087
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,319
you know network information here i

1088
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,440
found 172.18

1089
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,079
it's another network so here it's like i

1090
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,440
have a one

1091
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,440
one machine right in this machine

1092
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,800
talk to another network as you can see

1093
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,000
here so it's here it's a very

1094
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,119
interesting point

1095
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,359
because if you can think about i am an

1096
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,839
attacker right i'm a penetration tester

1097
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,880
i am trying to exploit

1098
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,000
this information so here i can found two

1099
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,880
different

1100
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,240
networks so how it's possible because

1101
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
this is the technique i can be used here

1102
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,480
i could use to pivoting to do a jumping

1103
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,640
from this network because i don't have

1104
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,480
access this network i just have this

1105
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:00,960
access

1106
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,640
and this network in the class b 172.20

1107
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,200
right i i don't have this access in this

1108
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,560
environment right

1109
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,880
so if i can access this environment

1110
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,560
let me pass for the next page

1111
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,040
right so now here i will say to the

1112
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,960
pivoting technique in this environment

1113
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,359
because i have access to do you remember

1114
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,319
in the beginning

1115
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,599
i try access in the class a right the

1116
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,280
range 10

1117
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,599
after that i get the access in the class

1118
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,160
b17220

1119
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,640
and now i have another access and the

1120
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,079
class the same class b but

1121
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,599
then 172.18

1122
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,960
range right so now i can

1123
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,880
using the pivoting technique i will

1124
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
using in the ssg4

1125
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,560
port i will using my private key do you

1126
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,240
remember that i created

1127
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,440
right so here i will use

1128
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,119
and you can check here this information

1129
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,599
right i can use the ssh

1130
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,319
hacker root access the class a

1131
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,359
right using the the port 22

1132
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,839
it's the the standard port of the ssh

1133
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,400
and i open my server in my attacker

1134
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:18,880
server

1135
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,800
dsport 1717

1136
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,480
from this machine that i once tried

1137
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,119
hacking

1138
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,160
or the first access that i was doing

1139
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,280
right so here i get the access

1140
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,319
so let's take a look at this

1141
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:44,079
because i put in the ip 172.20.0.150

1142
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,920
you know 2020 right and i open in my

1143
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,480
machine

1144
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,880
this port 77 and i

1145
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,920
and i got the access right root access

1146
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,400
and i tried to look in the inside the ip

1147
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,599
i look in there

1148
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,160
another ip17 doc20.10

1149
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,599
not one five zero so probably i am in

1150
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,200
the docker environment

1151
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,760
right because we i find i i founded the

1152
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,560
docker av

1153
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,359
right so here this is my machine because

1154
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:15,599
i

1155
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,720
am in the in the vpn of course so i am

1156
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,119
in the

1157
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,640
in two different network but now

1158
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,160
i have i open in my environment i open

1159
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,880
the port

1160
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,520
1717 right so here i will use

1161
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,640
the connect pub this is the you know the

1162
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,640
test account do you remember

1163
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,839
i using the test account here i using

1164
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,119
this port

1165
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,480
you know 77 port and i will open

1166
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,920
another port here to try access this

1167
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,200
another environment as you can see here

1168
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,680
you know 172.18

1169
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,839
so here you can look

1170
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,079
different networks right

1171
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,720
so after that i will put here if you can

1172
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
know you can see here

1173
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,240
take a look here i will i will try to

1174
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,359
put in the password

1175
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,240
i receive the effort and here i will

1176
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,280
pause you can

1177
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,480
look in the many others uh

1178
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,960
works mine here you can look in the the

1179
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,800
password i love toka do you remember

1180
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,599
when i

1181
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,200
put this information when i received

1182
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,280
this information in the chat

1183
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,440
in the top of these guys in the chat do

1184
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,560
you remember

1185
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,240
yeah so here i act i have access to the

1186
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,280
connect pc and here you can see

1187
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,480
i am in the

1188
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,280
another network now i have access in

1189
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,079
this environment

1190
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,359
take a look and look it's very very

1191
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,160
interesting because now i got the access

1192
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:48,880
and if i

1193
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,920
using the the ifconfig command i can

1194
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,839
receive the answer 17220 and one five

1195
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,640
zero

1196
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,359
maybe it's this machine right perfect

1197
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,480
but when you access

1198
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,400
inside the machine here you find one

1199
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,440
seven to

1200
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,800
20.010

1201
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,839
because this is the uh this

1202
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,800
information it's the uh you know this is

1203
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,119
the

1204
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,359
the docker and here it's the container

1205
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,480
inside the machine

1206
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,400
and here we have another container in

1207
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,160
this machine right so you have a

1208
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,720
different

1209
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,079
container inside this this environment

1210
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,800
right so here i access one seven two

1211
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,599
zero

1212
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,599
two uh two hundred so

1213
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,880
now i get the access in this

1214
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,440
environment if you can see here two

1215
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,119
different network

1216
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,880
it's the same case right just to compare

1217
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,119
this information right uh i'm looking

1218
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,559
of the you know the process

1219
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,640
and the ports are open

1220
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,440
you can see here you can take a look

1221
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,640
here

1222
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,520
so let me return here you can look in

1223
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,000
this

1224
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,880
any different sports and service open

1225
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,480
and works

1226
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,160
here it's very interesting

1227
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,760
right so and if you can see here the all

1228
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,319
parts

1229
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:18,000
are listening

1230
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,440
or listed right so here you can

1231
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,119
find this uh all this information

1232
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,440
right so after that what i can do here

1233
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,720
after i i open this

1234
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,280
this way or this path or i got this jump

1235
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,880
inside this network i can try to

1236
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,559
access this environment let me pass

1237
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,400
here here it's very important let me

1238
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,240
check here

1239
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,720
yes so here so after that i put the

1240
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,760
localhost

1241
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,200
in the the port 3000 because this is the

1242
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,160
port that i was

1243
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,960
open in my machine and here you can see

1244
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,440
the

1245
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,119
gogs application so here let me return

1246
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:05,599
here

1247
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,359
you can compare all this information

1248
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,640
because here i

1249
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,240
using this port that way as

1250
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,760
i was opened before right so this

1251
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,440
here is the technique the pivoting

1252
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,160
technique because i open this port

1253
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,400
in my machine and here i use this port

1254
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,040
that i opened to access this another

1255
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,680
network

1256
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,040
to jump into another network right

1257
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,720
using of course this uh test account

1258
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,160
because this test account has a

1259
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,319
privilege to access this network right

1260
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,440
and in the end as you can see here i

1261
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,640
access the gogs environment right

1262
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,720
but if you can see here how it's

1263
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,480
possible because i put here the local

1264
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,760
host but i'm

1265
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,960
i didn't install nothing in my

1266
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,920
environment right i i i didn't install

1267
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,559
nothing

1268
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,760
but i am i'm i'm accessed here by

1269
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,079
local host right but i'm using this port

1270
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,400
and this sports 3000 this port i opened

1271
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,720
right so this is the you can see here

1272
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,680
the flow

1273
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,880
that's a very interesting point i

1274
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,440
just can access here because i using the

1275
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,720
technique

1276
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,119
pivoting right so that's i think

1277
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,480
uh so here's it's the same okay does

1278
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,440
this the question

1279
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,319
and i finish my presentation and and

1280
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,680
thank you

1281
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,839
from the organization and the team and i

1282
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,200
open to some question if the

1283
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,680
the guys have or something like that so

1284
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:52,000
thank you again
