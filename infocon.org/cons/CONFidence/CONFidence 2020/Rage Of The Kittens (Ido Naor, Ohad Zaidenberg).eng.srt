you will be familiar with security jobs

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,640

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,920
uh as part of our engagement we have

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,400
this small platform which me and a

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,519
friend

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,400
established called viewers bay kind of

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,120
similar to

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,560
aristotle only smaller and more social

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
for those of you who like reverse

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
engineering and marvel analysis are

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,080
welcome to connect to virus bay

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
uh it's a really nice place to start

79
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,519
and also i'm guessing that

80
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,239
the communication between clear sky and

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,930
security jaws also

82
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,840
[Music]

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,319
links us to the israeli law enforcement

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,720
we work constantly with the israeli serb

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,239
and with the israeli cyber police

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,440
in order to not only uh focus on the

87
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,760
uh the iranian regime and their

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,879
cyberspace

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,680
but also other attackers uh you know

90
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,720
which are aimed

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,319
into uh demolishing ordinary lives of uh

92
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,159
citizens so um let's continue

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,519
the um i guess the major impact which

94
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,879
uh started this uh uh this

95
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,720
cyber space of iran uh

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,319
started with uh the attack on on the uh

97
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,760
natanz uh

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,439
uranium enrichment uh in iran and what

99
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,239
happened there

100
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,720
well it's a it's a big story and that's

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,799
why i thought well it's a really nice

102
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,360
place

for you uh for me to uh recommend on

it highlights uh specifically what were

117
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,040
the the origins of the attack what what

118
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,560
actually made uh uh the

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
the attacker targeting uh such a uranium

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,800
enrichment

121
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,320
base and also uh talks about the

122
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,120
the mario itself the uh the activity um

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,240
day to day and also the researchers who

124
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
investigated it uh years after

125
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,360
and found indicators of compromise

126
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
which you know were not even in the news

127
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
or in any place

128
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,479
other than this book also in a very

129
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,199
famous

130
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,400
forbes article we can see that

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,479
[Music]

132
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,000
someone was was quoting the fact

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
that um iran

134
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
invested heavily in building cyber

135
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,639
defenses

136
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,919
and cyber attack capabilities and with

137
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,240
you know the world cyber attack

138
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,479
capabilities involved

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
because ever since this event

140
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
and some other events which happened

141
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,039
just

142
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,680
right after the change between

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,639
what was the the cyber army of iran

144
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,199
prior

145
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,919
to after is major

146
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,240
if we look at the timeline we can see

147
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
that not only stuxnet was

148
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,560
the the major impact on iran

149
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,310
trying to

150
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,759
[Music]

151
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,639
run in this armed race having their own

152
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,840
state-sponsored units

153
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,960
even though if we look

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,039
prior to the stuxnet attack we can see

155
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,199
that the cyber operation program

156
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,680
which basically were fun was funded

157
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
somewhere around 2005

158
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,440
started its operation around 2009

159
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,720
however we haven't seen any

160
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
major attacks of course we have the

161
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,919
twitter attack

162
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,960
and uh and other similar uh

163
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,479
takedowns of uh platforms and social

164
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,400
platforms which we all know

165
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
today uh we consider strong even though

166
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,520
uh you know that the latest attack on

167
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,280
twitter uh showed us that

168
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,720
uh you know 2020 is not very uh far from

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
what happened in 20

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,479
in 2009 and

171
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,400
almost before stuxnet hits or maybe

172
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,599
during the stages of the preparation uh

173
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,400
the kaiba center which is very famous

174
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,759
for executing uh

175
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,280
cyber attacks uh later in the future

176
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,680
uh in 2010 uh just received funding

177
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
and established its uh its place in the

178
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,599
uh in the uh iranian

179
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,160
atmosphere or iranian arsenal

180
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,120
following the the stuxnet were two other

181
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,080
attacks

182
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,599
which are suspected to come from the

183
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,280
same origin one of them

184
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
is called dooku and the other one flame

185
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,759
also stronger

186
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,800
as stuxnet however focusing on different

187
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,599
motivation

188
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,960
both were uh for collecting espionage

189
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,919
and had

190
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,440
uh striking similarities to stuxnet each

191
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,479
with its own uh and following

192
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,440
uh the attacks on iran which are in red

193
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,000
we have

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,319
uh executions of attacks coming from

195
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,000
iran to the outside

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
a very famous one was the shamoon

197
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,400
operation which targeted the

198
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,840
aramco uh oil factory

199
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,200
um this was the way for uh

200
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,839
for us at least to understand uh that

201
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,479
following

202
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,519
uh the sanctions which came from from

203
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,159
the west

204
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,360
from from from obama on

205
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,000
on iran uh pushed some sort of uh

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,480
preparation of attack from the iranian

207
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,120
side

208
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
in order to in order to emphasize

209
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,200
uh the fact that they are very much

210
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,680
against what the world is

211
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
is about or what they have

212
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,959
for for iran and

213
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,000
right after came another operation which

214
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
haven't uh haven't went into news

215
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,120
articles but only five years later

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
it's called the operation of a bill

217
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,760
which was mostly revolving around the

218
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
denial of service attack

219
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,680
for in majority to uh financial

220
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,040
institutions and only

221
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,240
in 2018 it was

222
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,279
attributed to mabna institute which

223
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,160
uh is still operating by the way and if

224
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,920
you can if you want if you go ahead and

225
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,800
expand your

226
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,279
uh your knowledge about mobda institute

227
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,800
you can see that

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
it has links to state stay

229
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,399
state-sponsored

230
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,120
uh attackers which you know at the same

231
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,959
time of the operation of a bill

232
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,440
started to establish their place in the

233
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,720
um

234
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,000
in the cyber space uh so following these

235
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,920
uh state-sponsored attackers we have

236
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,079
apt-33 34.

237
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,079
if you take the two of them and you

238
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,560
somehow

239
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
you know link the indicators you can

240
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
also found and find another apt

241
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,240
which is called apt-39 or chaffer we'll

242
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,680
talk about it

243
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,079
just later in the slides and another

244
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,079
connection to some

245
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,880
apt called or called by mandi and

246
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,279
another

247
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,720
and other companies in apt-35

248
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
which also linked to some kittens

249
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,440
which we will discuss later the final

250
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,839
attack that i want to to emphasize or

251
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,480
talk about because in 2016 and 17

252
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
and following these years we've seen a

253
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,079
lot of the a lot of

254
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,959
a lot of attacks uh more of the same we

255
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,560
can see shamoon 2.0

256
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,240
in 2017 but the las vegas stands uh

257
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
destructive attack was very

258
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,519
special or unique because the founder

259
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
or the owner of las vegas sends the

260
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,839
sheldon edelson

261
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,519
the billionaire just went

262
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,200
live and published his agenda regarding

263
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
the iranian regime something that wasn't

264
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,640
acceptable

265
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,360
uh during that time in the beginning of

266
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,640
2014

267
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,279
and this destructive attack just uh gave

268
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,240
us a

269
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,720
like a quick uh like a quick

270
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,480
introduction into how

271
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,720
um the the execution of of operations

272
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,279
is happening first it happens very fast

273
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,320
and second of all

274
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,120
it's very propaganda uh oriented

275
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
what yes so uh ido

276
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,040
uh talked about magnets too we just

277
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
wanted to

278
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,200
um share this uh investment of

279
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,399
uh magnetized to this is really unique

280
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
on the matter of the iranian threat

281
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
actors

282
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,320
we saw many reports like that many

283
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,760
indicators like that

284
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
about lazarus for example about the

285
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,519
north korean

286
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,160
tweet actors but to see that the justice

287
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,560
department of the united states

288
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,240
and the fbi uh published wanted

289
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,560
of some iranian to attack what's highly

290
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,440
unique

291
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
and it assembled their connection the

292
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
strong connection between the iranian

293
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,839
records

294
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,959
to the iot to the sepa and it's

295
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,360
really really interesting to see that

296
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
the islamic revolutionary guard hopes

297
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,519
the separatists

298
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
which is the long arm of the iranian

299
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,519
regime can

300
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,480
can deploy cyber attack as well as

301
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,920
terror attacks around the world

302
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,560
it's really really in interesting and i

303
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:44,959
really

304
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,480
recommend for its uh investment

305
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,959
but the irgc is not the only body that

306
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,079
works in in

307
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,320
irvine although the the irgc the islamic

308
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,440
revolutionary guard hopes are completely

309
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,240
independent

310
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,200
from both the military and uh and the

311
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,399
government

312
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
with them are two um

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,839
i say um highly or very famous

314
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,560
uh uh bodies one of them is the ministry

315
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,000
of defense and the other one is the

316
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,680
minister of intelligence

317
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,200
uh in this talk we are not

318
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,800
connecting any of the state-sponsored uh

319
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,760
attackers to any of these organizations

320
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
and

321
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,160
the reason is because there is no um

322
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,120
one point or point a that points to

323
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,079
point b

324
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,160
there is no one direction to actually

325
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,320
associate an apt actor

326
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,160
with a body like irgc you can associate

327
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,040
the different

328
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
groups uh either these nine individuals

329
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,560
which

330
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,040
ohio talked about or different units

331
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,079
but not an entire sector of apt

332
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:56,880
attackers

333
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
however we do want to emphasize that

334
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,360
these three bodies are the main

335
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,120
executioners for for the

336
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,519
attacks that we are seeing coming from

337
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,800
from iran

338
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,639
it's not to be understanding that there

339
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
are overlaps between these

340
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,680
organizations it means that

341
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,920
the ministry of intelligence can do the

342
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,720
same thing

343
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
and the same target that the islamic

344
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,480
evolutionary guard hopes

345
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,079
want to attack and it's really

346
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,920
interesting to see these

347
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,079
overlaps in again

348
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,240
so we want to start with the first actor

349
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
uh apt-33

350
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,880
uh we took the logos from andy and

351
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
fireeye

352
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,120
which nicely show how

353
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,920
i don't know how apt actors can go into

354
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,320
one

355
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
an icon or something that symbolizes the

356
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
thread actor

357
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,720
uh and in addition we created some sort

358
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,160
of uh

359
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,920
i'd say id uh for for each of the thread

360
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,800
actor

361
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
uh so basically apt-33 is also known as

362
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,720
elfin

363
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,600
uh but also have different other names

364
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,320
uh

365
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,680
it is uh known since 2013 as we showed

366
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,959
in the timeline and

367
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,240
linked very much to shamoon the target

368
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,279
sectors which

369
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,800
you know that the group is uh focusing

370
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,199
on

371
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,480
is military aviation and petrochemical

372
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,839
just like we saw

373
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,199
on the attack on the aramco

374
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,880
and are notorious for uh for targeting

375
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,440
inducer control systems the focus of

376
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,240
this

377
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,279
of that group is mainly espionage

378
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,480
and are using a very wide arsenal of

379
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,959
tools like the backdoor of drop shot and

380
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,440
netwire and also are using web shells

381
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,480
like

382
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,200
alfa shell something that is very

383
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
[Music]

384
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
very unique for you know apts from from

385
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
iran using

386
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,720
uh net or aspx shell

387
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,279
for application servers what is

388
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,160
interesting about

389
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,440
this uh trajectory that it became

390
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,720
very advanced uh during the time not for

391
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,920
the code of the malware but the methods

392
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,279
so the attack vector which you know we

393
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
we see lately is the job offering

394
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,839
spear phishing emails however different

395
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
from lazarus for example which is a very

396
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,399
advanced threat actor from north korea

397
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,040
we can see that the job offering uh is

398
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,240
something that is

399
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
highly successful in terms of spill

400
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,519
fishing

401
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,399
and going after military or diplomatic

402
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:36,800
or

403
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,079
media with with job offering which are

404
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,160
you know maybe over linkedin or other

405
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
social networks

406
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,040
is becoming more and more

407
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,199
more and more uh interesting for the

408
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,480
attackers or

409
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,519
uh they see more success from there we

410
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,079
saw lazarus for example in the attack on

411
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,800
the chilean bank back in 2018

412
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,519
where they also use the same uh the same

413
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,839
method

414
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,959
the second character which we want to

415
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,919
focus about is apt-34

416
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,160
also known as oil rig or from other

417
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,079
from other companies such as cloud

418
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,160
cycles helix keaton

419
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,679
um and is it was in the past link to

420
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,959
ilgc

421
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,000
and the revolutionary

422
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,480
uh group that we talked about just

423
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,240
earlier

424
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,520
it is known since 2014 however it is

425
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,520
the the time the timeline between 2013

426
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
and 2014 is very

427
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,360
uh is very close so you'd see

428
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
that the threat actors from iran

429
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,400
basically

430
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,320
established the the attack

431
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,919
the attacks or crafted the the arsenal

432
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,880
at the same almost at the same time the

433
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,679
threat actors

434
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,799
are from that uh

435
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,760
from apt-34 are focusing on sectors like

436
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
the financial the government telecom and

437
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,799
energy

438
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,440
uh and and of course there are more uh

439
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,160
which we saw

440
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
and they are focusing uh mainly on

441
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
reconnaissance for the iranian regime

442
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
collecting information for uh to be used

443
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,080
later

444
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,960
in in attacks could also be terror

445
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,480
attacks

446
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,679
and this group is uh very much into open

447
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,760
source tools like the dns espionage and

448
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,120
the exploitator

449
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,720
uh and are using spear phishing with a

450
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,360
little spice of excel spreadsheets or a

451
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,160
world

452
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,679
and office uh documents um and within

453
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,080
them

454
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,000
rtf type rdf type

455
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,520
or dde type one days exploits

456
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,420
uh which could be used in order to

457
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,520
[Music]

458
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
to call the commanding control server

459
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,280
the interesting uh

460
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,200
thing that we saw in the news lately is

461
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,120
the fact that they move from

462
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,919
exfiltrating data over dns in cleartext

463
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,559
to

464
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,000
uh to exfiltrating over https

465
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
something that is called dns over https

466
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,799
and is unique for that group

467
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,960
apt-35 which we believe that is somehow

468
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,799
linked to rocket kitten

469
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,960
or charming kitten is an apt that is

470
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,919
sometimes called newscaster news beef

471
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,200
was after diplomatic and media

472
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,400
individuals in the past and is focused

473
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
on strategic intelligence

474
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,600
so a slight difference than

475
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,960
reconnaissance or espionage strategic

476
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,400
strategic intelligence we might go in

477
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,280
into the world of the media where you

478
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,039
know the attack want to

479
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,520
influence the the idea of the ideology

480
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,559
of specific sectors and

481
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,790
the arsenal is focusing on

482
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,080
[Music]

483
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,159
on tools such as the goalie which was uh

484
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,720
in the in the past uh was covered by

485
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,520
clear sky

486
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
as well in in one of the articles in the

487
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,880
mpk backdoor

488
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,640
but also on the other side you can see

489
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
that they are using

490
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,960
exploits with the metasploit framework

491
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,480
and for those of you who don't

492
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,520
know the next tool it's having an sql

493
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,919
injection tool which was originated

494
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,080
in iran at least from from what i know

495
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
so all of these are being used uh in in

496
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,360
the attacks from apt-35 which

497
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,480
are utilizing social engineering uh

498
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,840
as a way to impersonate uh a familiar

499
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,640
entity

500
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,880
from either the diplomatic media defense

501
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,440
defense sectors in order to

502
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,080
infiltrate into victims machines

503
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,760
last but not least will be the apt-39

504
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,559
which we think is an abbreviation of apt

505
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,280
34

506
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,559
and 33 but there is no

507
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,559
there is no solid links which we can uh

508
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,919
associate to that suspicion they also

509
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,240
know

510
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,520
as chaffer by their name

511
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,280
and are known since 2014 uh basically

512
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
focusing mainly on transportation

513
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,159
government telecom and media

514
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,720
and they are also focusing on

515
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
reconnaissance

516
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,559
and have different tools uh such as the

517
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,159
power bath which can be

518
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,559
seen in spear phishing attacks and the

519
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,679
aspx

520
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,679
spy which again links iranian

521
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,520
threat actors to web shells on

522
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,720
application servers

523
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,559
so in

524
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,799
the country like iran there are two

525
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,840
sides to the coin of how they attack

526
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
targets one of them is through the

527
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,400
predictors which johan will uh will

528
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,280
focus and

529
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,640
and talk about and the other one is the

530
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,919
outsource

531
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,320
there is a the infrastructure in iran in

532
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,880
regards to how to execute

533
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,000
operations um sometimes focuses

534
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,280
on uh on outsource on companies security

535
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,559
companies sometimes or

536
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,080
r d companies which executes

537
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,360
the the operations uh solely in

538
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,880
um in in an idea or in uh

539
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,720
in an act of uh um

540
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,400
of uh getting fond of the uh iranian

541
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,960
regime

542
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,440
i'm not sure regarding the sponsorship

543
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,120
of those operations

544
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,080
but i'm going to talk about one of these

545
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,520
one of these

546
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,960
campaigns which we captured

547
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,320
last year and of course

548
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
later on we'll talk about the nation

549
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,320
state actors

550
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,960
so advice league cooperation was covered

551
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,080
by kaspersky

552
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,919
my recent employer and it was uh

553
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,080
mainly revolving around an attack that

554
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,200
uh back toward

555
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,679
android applications inside these

556
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,440
applications was a delimiter which we

557
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,559
will discuss

558
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,679
uh and another application

559
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,840
which was modified by the attackers in

560
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,799
order to communicate between them

561
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,159
both were linked to the same cnc server

562
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,799
which in the domain who is revealed uh

563
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,320
the a person

564
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,559
or an individual which was behind the

565
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,120
attack with another group of people

566
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,640
and also revealed

567
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,679
the github account which was

568
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,039
forking the code of the modified

569
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,080
conversations app which sealed

570
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,240
the uh the investigation so

571
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,880
it all started with an app uh which had

572
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
uh striking modules

573
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,760
uh that were not part of the original

574
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,480
app

575
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,720
uh these modules uh came with uh

576
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,840
uh some interesting delimiter

577
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,440
um on a number of uh of the android

578
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,960
applications

579
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,200
and this delimiter also appeared on

580
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,320
another application

581
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
which was not associated with the same

582
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,679
attacks

583
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,520
and then raised our interest our

584
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,200
interest

585
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,240
on the right hand side the delimiter in

586
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,679
the code basically

587
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,000
shows an app which is an open source one

588
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,240
this app is called the conversations

589
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
it's a java or xmpp

590
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,600
type application which was crafted by

591
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,640
the attackers

592
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,919
so they can link it to their command

593
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,360
control server

594
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,840
and add more features for them to

595
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,799
communicate over

596
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,919
however if you look inside these

597
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,279
applications you can see that they are

598
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,640
connected to this

599
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,200
command and control without any

600
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
obfuscation

601
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,320
this is also something that shows us

602
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,440
that there was not

603
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
a lot of time invested in this attack

604
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,480
and it was an

605
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,120
opportunistic one probably pointing on

606
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,000
the fact that it was an outsource from

607
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,360
irgc or different bodies and somehow

608
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
this project came into the doorstep of

609
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,400
our attacker

610
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,760
and he decided to take ownership on it

611
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,600
we also see that the conversation that

612
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,960
was modified or the attackers modified

613
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
the icon

614
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,039
for it to not appear on

615
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,240
um appear on the mobile

616
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
something that raised more questions

617
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
regarding how they are using this

618
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,799
this application but if you look closely

619
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,679
in the who is

620
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,919
and we will make it very short you can

621
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,400
see that the email is being revealed

622
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
and once the email was revealed it was

623
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
easy for us to associate it

624
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,159
with a github account

625
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,279
uh which forked the conversations up the

626
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,799
same one which we saw

627
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,039
uh earlier in their research and in

628
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:09,039
2019 we attributed

629
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,679
the attack to its individuals and took

630
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,400
down

631
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
the attack so

632
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,559
rod thank you though and

633
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,320
as i mentioned we have four main apts

634
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,960
in iran that are state-sponsored but we

635
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,760
have more

636
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,640
state-sponsored group in iran which we

637
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,039
call

638
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,919
the kittens as you know apt is a

639
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,120
terminology by

640
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,520
fire and the great terminology and we

641
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,159
use

642
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,080
kind of other different and we're going

643
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,600
to go over

644
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,240
three terret actors three kittens that

645
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,600
we can consider as

646
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,159
three different layers of attacking

647
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:46,960
three of them

648
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,400
indicate of a attacks against personnel

649
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,279
against network via social engineering

650
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,000
and using

651
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,039
exploits to hack the system let's go for

652
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,720
the first group

653
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,360
charming kitten charming kitter is one

654
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,919
of my

655
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,720
favorite direct actor i really enjoy to

656
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,520
investigate

657
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,679
them because they are highly active and

658
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,039
they use so many

659
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,799
psychological methods in order to

660
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,200
attract their victims

661
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,159
they are affiliated with the irgc and if

662
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,200
we look on the

663
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,480
victim apps it's unbelievable they are

664
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,600
targeting

665
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,679
an academic researcher that focusing

666
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,360
iran in the research

667
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
iranian descendants we aspect the

668
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,520
presidential campaign if we

669
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,120
were in the leading to the u.s election

670
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,960
and it's really interesting to see what

671
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,399
charming kittens is going to do with

672
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,039
that

673
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,880
current informant u.s government

674
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,039
officials mainly from the secretary of

675
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,840
state

676
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,440
journalists that covering global

677
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,960
politics and

678
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,000
lately since march 2020 they are also

679
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,960
targeted for v19 related organization

680
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,720
and i'm going to talk about it in a few

681
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,039
minutes

682
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,240
those their method is spearfishing

683
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,440
they use mostly on they rely mostly

684
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
on social engineering methods it means

685
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
that they are targeting

686
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,159
the psychological fails of human and

687
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,600
some fun fact of them

688
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,080
they impersonated clear sky multiple

689
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,919
times the company i work for

690
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,120
let's see some examples for these ttps

691
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,840
these

692
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,720
social engineering directors the first

693
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,840
one i want to

694
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,279
present is an sms that one of the

695
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,960
victims got on the 21st of uh september

696
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,080
29th 2019

697
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,799
alert someone on unrecognized device

698
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,840
attempt to sign

699
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,720
in to your account if you want to change

700
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,159

please press on the link this is classic

702
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,480
fishing this is kind of complex to say

703
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,559
that it's still fishing but they target

704
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,360
the same person all of the uh

705
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,159
spearfishing

706
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,360
vectors that i'm going to present now is

707
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,360
was sent on the 21st of september

708
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,480
2019 and it's unbelievable they use so

709
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,360
many methods

710
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,240
at the same day against the same victim

711
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,480
another method and more common

712
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,679
is on gmail they sent allegedly

713
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,000
link to google drive as you can see from

714
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,799
the line

715
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,799
below but it's sent from google site

716
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,360
this is not even a real google site

717
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,600
email as you can see the domain

718
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,720
of a google site is google.com and the

719
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,760
domain of

720
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,919
the phishing the malicious email was

721
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,000
sent by

722
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,399
gmail.com in its small details

723
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,320
the charming kitten level address

724
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
because they believe

725
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,120
that their victims wouldn't recognize it

726
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,000
in some cases you investigate this year

727
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,960
they attack

728
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,200
really old people that don't know a lot

729
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,159
of technology

730
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,120
and they leverage it to attack them and

731
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,399
i think

732
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,600
it's really bad to do it

733
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,399
another uh option of a social

734
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,600
engineering director

735
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,840
is another mail that's sent by allegedly

736
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,880
sarah trenty

737
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,159
that claim that she received so many

738
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,960
unwanted advertising email from your

your email address

740
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,960
so we have one some pressure that they

741
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,520

742
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,520

749
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,399
impersonate other researcher in trying

750
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,360
to attack them

751
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,720
in some other cases the impersonate

752
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,120
journalist in some cases just unknown

753
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,640
people as you know

754
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,159

755
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,720
really amazing email another one that's

756
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,440
on the

757
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,559
21st of september this is a recovery

758
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,760
options change someone that claimed that

759
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,880
a telephone number was added to the

760
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,919
gao account but if you look on the ap

761
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,039
on the location that allegedly the phone

762
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,000
was added

763
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,480
is from north korea it means charming

764
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,919
kitten has no problem

765
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,720
to connect from allegedly north korea

766
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,039
and to impersonate

767
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,640
so they are really brave in some cases

768
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,120
when the victim will open the file the

769
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,760
link it's

770
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
almost the same you're going to a google

771
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,880
site

772
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,399
but you can see in the edit of the um

773
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,399
of the gmail of the google home this is

774
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,039
the name is drive but it's a google site

775
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,279
when you press on the link

776
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,399
this is the spill phishing website

777
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,880
okay as you can see now this is no email

778
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,919
dot gmail

779
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,600
gmail.com i changed it it was the victim

780
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,640
email it will open it and you will see

781
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,080
that his name is in is another method

782
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,360
to affect the victim to open it if you

783
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:53,679
look

784
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,200
on the subdomain mobiles in some cases

785
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,880
these indicate two-factor authentication

786
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,320
website they not only want to steal the

787
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,519
credentials

788
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,799
for your email they want also to

789
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,679
overcome two-factor authentication if

790
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,080
they

791
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,159
if you have two-factor authentication

792
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,760
first they will steal

793
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,720
your password and second they will try

794
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,039
to

795
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,760
convince you to get into another mail of

796
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,240
them

797
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,440
another link another link of them

798
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,919
and to enter two-factor authentication

799
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,679
number so they can enter

800
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,080
to your domain to your gmail

801
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,120
we publish multiple reports about

802
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,600
charming kitten from 2017

803
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,440
until now only two weeks ago we

804
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,880

805
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,039
report we call it the kittens are back

806
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,799
in town

807
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,600
i want to share some of the insights

808
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,080
from and some of the findings from this

809
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,120
report

810
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,159
first this email they impersonated

811
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,200
some reporter from deutsche deutscher

812
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,760
is a magazine in germany that has

813
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,399
multiple

814
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,440
iranian descendants reporter and it's

815
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,640
really important fact

816
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,760
please remember that they send

817
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,679
their doctor and the name of the doctor

818
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,080
from haifa university in israel

819
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
may have a minute of your time and in

820
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,679
this campaign we discovered

821
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,120
that they target they targeted doctors

822
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,360
and researchers in haifa university in

823
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,440
in other universities in israel

824
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,600
and around the world mostly in europe

825
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,640
and they target

826
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,240
also u.s embassy personnel from all

827
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,279
around the world

828
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,200
mostly from places that has connection

829
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,399
to iran

830
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,279
this email unlike the other emails is

831
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,200
very very short

832
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,159
let's look at another email from

833
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,240
allegedly mercy oster from jewish

834
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,120
journal

835
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,080
this is unbelievable because we exposed

836
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,320
the impersonation to jewish journal

837
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,919
in 2017 in the last three years

838
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,640
charming kitten keep impersonating

839
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,840
jewish journal

840
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,480
en deutsche vale three years ago they

841
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,120
put a

842
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,799
waterhole in the jewish journal website

843
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,639
now they did the same with deutsche vera

844
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,480
they also used a fake linkedin account

845
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,679
to gain the trust of the victim

846
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,960
it means now that we have sms we have

847
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,359
email and we have linkedin it's really

848
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,480
important to see

849
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,960
how social engineering trying to gain

850
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,440
the trust of the victim

851
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,760
a month ago we published the lean job

852
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,599
campaign by north korea

853
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,639
and they used daily life mostly on

854
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,359
linkedin

855
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,000
because in linkedin you can get a

856
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,800
message

857
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,239
that goes directly to your email by

858
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,879
some of the reporter and it's really

859
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,000
hard to check whether

860
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,639
this person is a real person or imposter

861
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,199
let's return to jewish journal because

862
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,560
in this journal they

863
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,839
also had chat on whatsapp

864
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,400
chatting whatsapp it's highly risky for

865
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
any threat actor

866
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
because you have number you have a photo

867
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,760
but you can also execute a phone call

868
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,079
and if you remember i told you that in

869
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,359
deutsche well there are

870
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,960
many people that originally from iran so

871
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,520
they have

872
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,200
accent then they overcome on accent and

873
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,320
suspicious

874
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,599
um suspicious ways in the phone call

875
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,000
you know me i'm a reporter i born in

876
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,599
iran i have an accent

877
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,040
now trust me when i'm speaking with you

878
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,200
let's see some examples of this

879
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,119
conversation because it was

880
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,400
10 days of conversation on whatsapp

881
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,359
on the first day they tried to they

882
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,160
attempt

883
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,520
to do a voice call between the uh

884
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,240
victim and the attacker allegedly a

885
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,000
reporter from deutsche were

886
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,480
on the third day the victim answered and

887
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,320
then on the fourth day

888
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,960
the attacker sent the following message

889
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,520
this

890
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,720
is a long message on whatsapp but i want

891
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,760
to emphasize

892
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,200
two main issues first we host about 114

893
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,560
participants

894
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,520
a lot of participants but you you the

895
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,720
victim of course

896
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,079
is invited to to be a special

897
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,720
speaker in the webinar and the webinar

898
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,000
is about iran

899
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,960
and israel so it's your expertise and

900
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,680
also

901
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,960
about iran and china agreement this is

902
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,160
not the first time they use

903
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,960
iran in china they use it before and

904
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,760
they keep

905
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,720
returning and reusing the same methods

906
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,040
but

907
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,280
changing the ttps a little bit that's so

908
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
important to track

909
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,599
closely any social engineering group

910
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,079
targeting the sector that you work for

911
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,560
or the sector that you research for um

912
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,760
because they're changing

913
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,599
the methods that psychological methods

914
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,040
all the time

915
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,680
let's see the same message that was sent

916
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,040
on the ninth day

917
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,720
we asked again 114 participants

918
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,760
but since you are the main speaker the

919
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,400
victim

920
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,040
didn't answer this willing to open the

921
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,720
malicious link

922
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,560
so they changed a little bit the

923
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,760
terminology

924
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,079
now it's not special speaker it's the

925
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,280
main speaker

926
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,400
all is on you you are the main

927
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,640
speaker of this webinar you have to

928
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,599
participate

929
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,000
this is a layer this is the ways to

930
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,599
convince the victim to open the

931
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,359
malicious link

932
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,440
what is hosted in the malicious link

933
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,640
this is a water wall

934
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,760
in deutsche bay original website in

935
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,079
subdomain academia deutsche welle

936
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,160
the dw dot the e

937
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,280
this it wasn't the first time i saw this

938
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,320
fishing kit

939
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,599
used by charm kitten they did the same

940
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,400
thing

941
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,240
in the same fishing kit when they

942
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,640
impersonate clear sky cyber security the

943
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,440
company

944
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,760
i work for in 2018 in july

945
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,640
2019 we identified a malicious

946
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,839
website that impersonates us our website

947
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,200
is clearskysec.com the malicious website

948
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,240
was clearskysecurity.net

949
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,280
with efficiency if you try to open the

950
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,839
google for example you'll get the

951
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,560
original

952
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,760
google log inside but if you will press

953
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,680
the outlook you get the phishing kit

954
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,040
and this is something that i really

955
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,880
enjoy to show in my

956
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,079
talks this is the source code of

957
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,599
the malicious website and as you can see

958
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,119
on the default time zone they left asia

959
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,320
tehran and in the location that they do

960
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,760
the redirection to

961
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,040
they put clearskysecurity.com not our

962
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,880
website not the original one

963
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,400
and not the impersonator

964
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,119
as we mentioned before german kitten

965
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,720
tried to attack

966
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,400
companies in corona virus covid19

967
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,839
related organization

968
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,920
when you publish the attack against

969
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,280
gilead company

970
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,599
and we publish the iocs on our twitter

971
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,280
account and anyone can check that

972
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,079
that's the way we believe that it's most

973
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:12,960
transparent

974
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,520
do the transparent way to do to share

975
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,320
the irises

976
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,599
so anyone can verify the information

977
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,640
they respond for the first time and the

978
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,800
iranians mission to the united

979
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,000
nations denied it and said the iranian

980
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,160
government does not engage in cyber

981
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,280
warfare this

982
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
whole presentation is about the cyber

983
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,640
warfare in iran

984
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,960
and a lot of country countries around

985
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,160
the world do it

986
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,720
but it's hard to say that the iranian

987
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,240
government does not engage in cyber

988
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,800
warfare

989
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
this is not info this is really

990
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,079
offensive

991
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,280
act by iran as you don't mention shamu

992
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,960
and we are going to see some more of

993
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
that

994
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,480
so if i try to summarize charming kitten

995
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,960
this is three tactile that used in

996
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,160
psychological

997
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,280
ways social engineering ways to attack

998
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,760
personnel it means that the

999
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,040
responsibility

1000
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,599
to get protected from this attack it's

1001
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,160
on

1002
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,560
the personnel that they target it's

1003
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,599
really

1004
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,280
and it's really important to be to

1005
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,599
understand who targets you

1006
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,079
anyone can be a target it's just a

1007
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:20,720
question

1008
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,160
of who is targeting them another group

1009
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,920
is muddy water and we talked about

1010
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,839
kittens they also have the names

1011
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,240
static items let's see some examples for

1012
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,400
muddy water or static hittance they are

1013
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
also affiliated with

1014
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,000
ilgc and they connect the terminology

1015
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
is government entities and imported

1016
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,319
personnel to the iron energy

1017
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,599
of the iotc and also companies that i

1018
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,760
can't elaborate right now the ttp is

1019
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,560
spearfishing decoy documents and dns

1020
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,200
styling

1021
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,319
gun tunneling oh is that named power

1022
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,280
stats on the

1023
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,880
on static they also

1024
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,680
impersonated iraq and turkey but clear

1025
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,560
skill as well

1026
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,280
let's see some examples this is the

1027
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,200
first thing that the victim got

1028
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,599
from allegedly iran center this is the

1029
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,880
center of studies

1030
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,680
of iranian studies in ankara they made

1031
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,440
the connection the first connection

1032
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,000
without any link just a conversation

1033
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,359
between the attacker

1034
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,440
the alleged reporter and victim

1035
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,560
then they asked the victim to meet them

1036
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,760
in person

1037
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,839
the victim said i can't meet you in

1038
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,680
person because they asked to meet in a

1039
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,319
country that

1040
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,119
the victim can't go to so they're

1041
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:39,839
sending

1042
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,160
the following email the sentence you for

1043
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,520
the information done

1044
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,560
we will come later to meet you in person

1045
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,640
after we have decided about traveling to

1046
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,800
israel of course they can't because they

1047
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,079
i formed the iron c but they sent

1048
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,200
the victim a file when you open the link

1049
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,680
go to one drive another way to gain the

1050
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,640
trust

1051
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,000
see the zip and on the zip that was the

1052
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,240
malicious documented decoy document

1053
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,440
of the victim and

1054
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,400
as you can see is required to enter

1055
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,839
security code

1056
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,040
the security code was sent by email

1057
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,760
this is another options for that and as

1058
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,800
you can see

1059
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,960
there is sentence two sentence to be

1060
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,240
honest in

1061
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,720
farsi

1062
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,960
that they foreign in iran too they

1063
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,720
attack outside the iran

1064
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,599
and inland i want to use

1065
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,040
the secure walk workflow and they did

1066
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,160
amazing job

1067
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,800
we have two types of malicious document

1068
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,760
the first one

1069
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,040
the right one the green one is opening a

1070
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,240
macro

1071
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,000
that opens a power shell via a ws script

1072
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,359
then connect to hacked c to server

1073
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,400
download another powershell and then

1074
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,800
power stats the rat that we talked about

1075
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,319
it another option

1076
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,440
is follow that follow that using dns

1077
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,480
tunneling

1078
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,920
and if we look at that the right one is

1079
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,720
power stats

1080
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,520
the left one is followed it's really

1081
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,720
interesting to see

1082
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,000
the centred actor uses two ways of

1083
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,800
infection when they use the nest and

1084
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,079
they impersonate

1085
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,560
in the malicious website the malicious

1086
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,280
domain

1087
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,440
to some vendors like trend micro

1088
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,560
kaspersky

1089
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,160
and clear sky as well

1090
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,200
later on this year we identified another

1091
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,240
malicious vector of muddy water they

1092
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,880
sent

1093
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,280
legitimate link in the mail as you can

1094
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,079
see here

1095
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,119
this is a an example for the male

1096
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,200
then totally clean excel file

1097
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,520
as you can see there is a symbol of the

1098
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,079
turkish government as they used before

1099
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,280
you can see double enable editing

1100
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,880
on the writer photo it means

1101
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,720
that they made a mistake but they use

1102
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,280
the same logo to attack

1103
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,960
in the clean as in the clean excel file

1104
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,119
when you press on the link you'll get

1105
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,480
another zip file

1106
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
and in the zip file there is the

1107
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,119
malicious

1108
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,280
let's go back you see the designing

1109
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,720
of the green file this is really bad

1110
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,839
right

1111
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,200
so muddy water does a lot of effort

1112
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,319
to get better look on that this is

1113
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:36,880
beautiful

1114
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,319
the color is so looking good comparing

1115
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,280
to the world

1116
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,319
with to enable editing now we have

1117
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,200
something that look very very authentic

1118
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,280
but it's not the only ttp we uncovered

1119
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,079
this year

1120
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,920
we also saw pdf file this is not a pdf

1121
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,000
of course about the corona virus but

1122
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,680
it's not an original pdf

1123
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,640
this is an xfi the deploy malware into

1124
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,760
your system

1125
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,160
so who is responsible to get protected

1126
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,960
from charming

1127
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,160
for maddie water both personnel that was

1128
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,280
affected

1129
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,920
by social engineering because they

1130
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,800
targeted

1131
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,280
some person to open the malicious file

1132
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,079
they want

1133
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,200
the act or the target to press

1134
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,839
enable editing or enable content or to

1135
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,560
open

1136
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,079
the malicious pdf but not only on the

1137
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,680
um on the person they need also

1138
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,280
some of of protection methods

1139
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,480
in the organization they want to attack

1140
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,200
the last protector that i want to talk

1141
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,680
about

1142
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,319
is fox kid we have a fox kitten on

1143
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,599
february this year

1144
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,000
and it's one of the most sophisticated

1145
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,280
threat actor

1146
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,000
i saw from iran to understand the story

1147
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,040
of fox kitten we need to start in 2017

1148
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,359
when we identified some attack by

1149
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,280
already apt-34 as

1150
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,240
edo mentioned before targeting i.t

1151
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,880
sector

1152
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,119
communication sector and academic sector

1153
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,079
in israel

1154
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,800
and worldwide this is a malicious smell

1155
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,680
they sent

1156
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,280
to the victim as you can see by the

1157
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,440
na this is a global secure vpn

1158
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,000
they send a link to the vpn with

1159
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,680
username and password

1160
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,599
the vpn is juniper by pull secure vpn

1161
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,280
remember that when the victim will open

1162
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,240
the link with the email and the password

1163
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,599
that they got in

1164
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,040
you will find a manual to find a link to

1165
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,839
a manual

1166
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,920
in the system we uncovered that in 2017

1167
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,400
and so that's it we uncovered all the

1168
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,000
operation

1169
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,839
we didn't in 2018 we identified

1170
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,280
this full operation by fox kitten

1171
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,839
fox kitten is one of the most widespread

1172
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,560
iranian

1173
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,280
espionage and officially campaign we

1174
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,240
ever saw

1175
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,280
operated more than three years against

1176
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,920
dozens of companies and organizations in

1177
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,560
israel

1178
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,240
and around the world you can find a full

1179
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,599
report in our website

1180
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,760
and to see in how many countries they

1181
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,680
attacked they attacked utilities

1182
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,480
companies

1183
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
in the us as the elected company of the

1184
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,760
us they

1185
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,160
attacked i.t companies telecommunication

1186
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,960
oil and gas

1187
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,319
aviation government and more and more

1188
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:27,520
and more to breach the organization

1189
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,559
they use they used

1190
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,680
wait to bridge the organization they use

1191
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,480
exploits one they exploit they didn't

1192
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,760
develop the

1193
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,119
vulnerability but they used like after

1194
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,599
a few days since the moment that the

1195
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,200
vulnerability was published

1196
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,559
they leveraged it the first one is on

1197
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,920
pulse secure vpn it means that they use

1198
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,800
the same

1199
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,599
techniques methods after they breach the

1200
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:56,800
organization

1201
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,079
they started to gain persistency and to

1202
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,119
enable them

1203
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,280
the way to connect the system this is an

1204
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,160
example

1205
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,359
for what we call power ssh

1206
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,720
net this is a tool that developed

1207
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,839
by fox kitten in order to

1208
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,040
gain the possibility to connect to do an

1209
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,079
rtp connection over an ssh talent from

1210
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,599
the internal network

1211
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,440
of the victim to the internet skipping

1212
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,319
vpns and rdp system they gain

1213
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,839
persistency also

1214
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,640
with a port scanner that in that can do

1215
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,240
a brute force and you can see the

1216
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,319
protocols that they are searching for

1217
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,319
rdp ssh and mysql

1218
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,559
another method that they did not only

1219
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:43,440
rely of

1220
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,760
privilege escalation tools like the

1221
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,640
power such

1222
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,640
net or the stsr port scanner

1223
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,760
they also need really interesting

1224
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,559
methods

1225
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,160
such as replacement the stick keys file

1226
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,680
with shell with admin privileges

1227
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,960
they connected via the power ssh

1228
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,400
tool the power section tool over rdp

1229
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,079
rdp over ssh to the system

1230
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,440
and then they press five times on

1231
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,400
shift to open the shell code not the

1232
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,520
stick is

1233
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,319
really really interesting method another

1234
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,079
method that they did

1235
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,520
is to try to gain more password

1236
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,559
in the system to create local user and

1237
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,800
so on and so on and so on

1238
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,280
i really recommend to read all this

1239
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,400
operation because

1240
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,680
it presents what does it mean from an ad

1241
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,880
to deploy such a sophisticated method

1242
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,520
such as sophisticated operation that can

1243
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,319
be

1244
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,680
in so many organizations worldwide

1245
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,720
without getting uncovered we published

1246
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,079
this operation

1247
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,440
on february 2020 and you thought

1248
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,000
okay this is the end of the operation we

1249
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,960
exposed all the tools that they used

1250
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,319
but this is not the end a few weeks ago

1251
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,319
the f5 warns the fbi wants that fox

1252
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,480
kitten the same protacto

1253
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,599
uses the f5 exploit

1254
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,480
the f5 exploit was published only around

1255
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,000
two months ago

1256
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,280
they know how to identify

1257
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,640
d one day exploits and to

1258
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,960
leverage them in the system in the

1259
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,559
victims that they want

1260
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,520
so fast and it's really important to

1261
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,880
understand it

1262
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,520
so if i'll try to conclude the

1263
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,520
state-sponsored group

1264
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,880
they executive they execute

1265
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,760
destructive espionage campaigns based on

1266
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,880
propaganda

1267
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,319
pr social engineering and of course

1268
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,040
these groups are fond of one-day

1269
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,240
vulnerabilities

1270
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,640
and really quick to exploit them in the

1271
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,280
wild

1272
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,680
you need to monitor your system in order

1273
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,880
to get protected

1274
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,280
from fox kitten monitor the system all

1275
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:05,920
the time

1276
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,720
search for the tools search for for

1277
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,440
example

1278
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,000
juicy potato and rotten potato in your

1279
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,640
system

1280
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,880
this is totally open source tool that

1281
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,680
they use

1282
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,400
but also to patch the winery's

1283
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,359
vulnerabilities

1284
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,920
as fast as you can we know that they use

1285
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,640
citrix

1286
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,640
a few days after we published the report

1287
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,400
we identified that they use

1288
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,640
sequence vulnerabilities since at least

1289
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,119
2013

1290
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,319
iran have invested in space sponsored

1291
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,280
attack

1292
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,319
threat actors and of course the

1293
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,200
outsourcing that he dimension and not

1294
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,839
afraid

1295
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,400
of showing the world who their targets

1296
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,359
are

1297
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,920
as they did with shamon as they did with

1298
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,119
duskman and zero clear that was exposed

1299
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,960
on the end of 2018 they do destructive

1300
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,520
attack

1301
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,800
they do espionage both in personnel

1302
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,520
and both on organization and the regime

1303
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,680
divided through threat after

1304
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,760
and outsourcing this is not the only

1305
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,760
sphere in iran that they use

1306
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,040
use it all the time also with defense

1307
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,760
meta

1308
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,559
also with nuclear metals but it's really

1309
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,680
important to see

1310
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,599
how they use people in iran to attack

1311
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,920
and threat actors from the minister of

1312
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,720
intelligence

1313
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,160
the irgc and the ministry of defence

1314
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,440
and this is it this is the rage of the

1315
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,240
kittens

1316
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,480
we started to talk about what brought

1317
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,800
again to the cyber domain

1318
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,119
what was the response of iran with

1319
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,000
shamoon

1320
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,160
the response for stuxnet and all the

1321
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,559
others operations that he do mentioned

1322
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,000
we ex we provide an overview of the apts

1323
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,760
of iran some kind of the identity of

1324
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,079
them

1325
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,079
we talked about outsourcing and you

1326
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,720
don't mention uh vice liquor

1327
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,599
the great report of them bicycle was the

1328
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,720
first support that

1329
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,880
you do and i talked and so this is

1330
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,800
really nice to talk about it together

1331
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,000
here then we examine charming kitten the

1332
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,680
target personnels with social

1333
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,119
engineering methods

1334
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,520
modding water static eaton attacking

1335
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,480
personnel

1336
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,760
but in order to attack networks and fox

1337
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,400
hidden

1338
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,680
that want to do a widespread offensive

1339
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:29,839
espionage campaign

1340
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,000
you
