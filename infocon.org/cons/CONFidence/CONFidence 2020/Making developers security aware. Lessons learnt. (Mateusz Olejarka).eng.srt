1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,440
let's go back in time to the year 1940

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,080
and german plans to invade france this

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,160
here is the ebon email fort

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,720
a belgian stronghold at the albert canal

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,000
the struggle was meant

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,720
to stop german troops on their way west

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
by destroying nearby bridges

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
if necessary this complex was considered

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,360
one of the best of its time

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
alongside the imaginative line and the

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,399
siegfried line

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,399
was it possible to capture the

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,840
stronghold without a long siege

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,399
well it was very difficult task almost

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,680
impossible

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,160
at least the builders thought so and it

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,879
was

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,360
assuming that enemy will strike from a

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,640
certain bearings

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,920
and the strike would be done by the

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,719
ground forces the germans proven that

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,480
assumption wrong

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,920
on 10th may 1940 at 4 30 am

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,920
42 u 523 m aircrafts took off

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,200
each one was throwing a dfs gliders with

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,760
five paratroopers in it 10 of those

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,799
gliders

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,000
50 paratroopers were meant to capture

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,280
the fort itself

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,000
and the rest of the forces was dedicated

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,799
to capture

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,119
nearby bridges it was the assad

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,479
battalion

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,680
unit they forced nearly 700 of the

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,400
defenders

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,960
to surrender and capture two of the free

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
and nearby bridges

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
opening the way west for the german 6

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,159
armor

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,720
why was that possible from the ground

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,360
side

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,560
uh the fort was well protected we have

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,200
on the map we can see the canal on the

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,320
right side

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,640
uh on the left side there is a river

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
around the fort there's a lot of barbed

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,799
wire

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,840
trenches but

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,880
the fort had only one anti-aircraft

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,840
station

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
equipped with only four machine guns

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,880
so a weak spot reason number one

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,600
no one suspected that the germans will

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,479
appear

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,599
already inside the fort landing

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,520
right on top of the defenders using

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
those gliders

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
uh white dots on the map mark

59
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,760
the landing spots so here we have an

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,959
element of surprise

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,080
reason number two

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,480
the paratroopers immediately attacked

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,440
all entrances

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
to the fort and blew up all gun turrets

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,360
and cannons

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
to do that they use a new kind of

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,800
explosive

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,440
uh more precise and powerful reason

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599
number three

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,440
and going back to the current day i

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,959
think we can find

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,200
similarities with this story when we

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,000
look at

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,959
application security or id security

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,840
world

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
in my opinion when we boot our

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
strongholds

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,040
uh we rely on tools and products too

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,480
much

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,920
big shiny ready to stop uh each attack

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,599
and yet there's always something which

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,319
is missed and the bad guys still end up

83
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,760
in the middle of our fort

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,080
like those part troopers we tend to

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
forget about the people

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,800
which i believe are more important asset

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,040
in the application security knowledge

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,280
skills curiosity vigilance and

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
motivation

90
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
hi my name is mateo soliarca i am a

91
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,200
senior security specialist at securing

92
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,799
most of the time i do web application

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,640
penetration testing

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,440
more and more i work with software

95
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,799
development teams

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,959
helping them with application security

97
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,920
issues

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,720
in software development i am i'm

99
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,200
co-author of the security aware

100
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,280
developer workshop which is main reason

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,879
behind this talk

102
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,280
i will share with you lessons i learned

103
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,959
about the apsec

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,680
when either i or my colleagues were

105
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,560
giving

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
up this workshop

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,519
the concept behind the workshop is

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,680
purely defensive we do not teach

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
developers how to

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
do penetration testing of web

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,239
applications but we show them

112
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,360
vulnerabilities

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,120
their colors uh their possible outcome

114
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,000
and then we let developers invent

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
possible fixes and security improvements

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,720
we focus on security awareness and the

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
fixing mindset

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
and back then three years ago when i was

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,960
creating the content i had my own view

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
of how application security should look

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,040
like

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
inside an organization as a former

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,400
developer

124
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
i had the knowledge of how

125
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,240
a typical software development looks

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,800
like

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
and with that i went to run my first

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
edition of this workshop

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,680
and my concept evolved quite

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,080
unexpectedly during those three years

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,199
based on the discussion as we had with

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,560
developers

133
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
during the workshops uh i wanted to

134
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,600
share with you

135
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
lessons i learned about the application

136
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,639
security

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,639
from developers so let's jump

138
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,320
to lessons this picture

139
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
shows one of the most devastating

140
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,800
attacks on u.s troops in history

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
the per harbor getting the back

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,919
communication

143
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,080
first there were intelligence reports

144
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,639
indicating the possibility of an attack

145
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
which did not get the priority high

146
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
enough second

147
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
there were orders issued informing among

148
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,759
the possibility of a japanese innovation

149
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,759
and the orders did not mention per

150
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,440
harbor specifically

151
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,560
so neither uh troops disposition nor

152
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
their readiness level

153
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,280
was changed and finally the incoming

154
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,560
japanese

155
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
aircrafts were mistakenly treated as

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,000
friendly bombers

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
which were to appear in that same time

158
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,880
frame during my workshop

159
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
i heard a lot of complaints about the

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,680
security people let me quote a few

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,319
they do not understand how we work they

162
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
do not reply on our emails

163
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,800
you have to wait a long long time before

164
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
they eventually help you

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,520
they say make it secure but not how

166
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,440
exactly

167
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,479
if you as a security people want to work

168
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,960
effectively with developers this has to

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,840
end

170
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,639
communication is one of the soft skills

171
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,800
you just have to master

172
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,360
it's the most important skill in it of

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,400
the future

174
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
drop your cubicle for a while get out of

175
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,039
your anonymous mailbox security at

176
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,080
something

177
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,880
i go meet developers in person play

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,400
whatever games they are playing in the

179
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
office right now

180
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,639
drink coffee tea whatever or not do that

181
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,319
remotely

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,039
then and only then you can hear stories

183
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,080
stories about

184
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,759
what they are struggling with in case of

185
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,840
application security and those stories

186
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,160
might scare the [ __ ] out of you or might

187
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,000
not but there's only

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
one way to find out it's go and talk

189
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,680
this picture presents polish anti-tank

190
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
rifle pattern 35

191
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,240
it was a successful weapon capable to

192
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,199
penetrate armor of any german tank

193
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,039
used during the invasion of poland from

194
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,240
the distance less than 100 meters

195
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
its deployment to troops was under

196
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,240
strict secrecy

197
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
the rifles were delivered in wooden

198
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
boxes disguised

199
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
as measurement gear on 15th july 1939

200
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
the order was issued to train selected

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,160
soldiers

202
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
and officers with their weapon

203
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,639
unfortunately the number of

204
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,680
uh available rifles was around three and

205
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
a half thousand

206
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,400
uh so sadly it was not enough

207
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,720
it was a such a good weapon that the

208
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,759
germans included

209
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,759
it in their arsenal and those fairy

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,160
rifles were used during the

211
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
assault on the ebony ford

212
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,520
why i mentioned the rifle because of the

213
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,560
secrecy

214
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
uh because of the order which came out

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,240
late to open the boxes

216
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
and finally because of the small amount

217
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,759
available in a few companies i visited

218
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,759
and the security department was seen by

219
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,440
the developers as like a

220
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,759
secret big brother which is always

221
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,199
watching

222
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,000
uh to quote the security guards are

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,639
definitely

224
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,919
watching raps kellner

225
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,520
smith i tried vividly to destroy

226
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,120
this happens when you build your

227
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,039
trenches of another department

228
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,520
compartment whatever and those anonymous

229
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,560
mailboxes

230
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,800
mentioned before i.t security department

231
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
is not almighty though it's probably

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,919
understaffed and

233
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,000
enemy forces have the advantage it's

234
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
hard to protect everything on

235
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,679
ever-changing battlefield

236
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
that's why you should help and guide

237
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,279
developers because they are the main

238
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,000
focus

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,720
behind the secure applications key issue

240
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,600
here

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,240
is the developer's attitude which is

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,880
usually

243
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
i don't care or i don't have

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
time for security although i met

245
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,839
developers

246
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,000
which understood the need to work on

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,120
security side

248
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,519
of their applications they were badly

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,560
outnumbered

250
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
i think also it heavily depends from the

251
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
company there is

252
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
from my experience there is a big

253
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,760
difference between

254
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
people building a crypto exchange and

255
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
people doing some internal applications

256
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,040
during the world war ii american air

257
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,839
force

258
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,760
faced an interesting life and death

259
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,040
problem

260
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
not all bombers not all fighters return

261
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,279
to base after a combat flight

262
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,360
on the picture you can see the results

263
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,110
of a study

264
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,800
[Music]

265
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,279
where the planes which returned were

266
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,160
mostly

267
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,480
are hit the solutions to the the

268
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,320
solution to the problem seems to be

269
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,800
easy and straightforward put more armor

270
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,839
on wings and hull

271
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,320
and there you go statistician at

272
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
blackham wall pointed out

273
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
that planning improvements in the armor

274
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
based on the planes which returned

275
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,600
from combat flights is badly flawed

276
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,560
because

277
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
the most sensitive parts might be the

278
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,160
ones

279
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
that were not discovered in the study

280
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,519
because the planes which took damage

281
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,160
there simply did not return to base

282
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,800
this is the survival bias when you take

283
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,480
your data without considering

284
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,959
if there are unknown reasons which make

285
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,480
your data set

286
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,839
non-representative so

287
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,920
do not focus on what was found think

288
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,839
also what could have been

289
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,240
missed and the same issue goes with

290
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,440
penetration testing

291
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
and not all vulnerabilities will be

292
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
found pentest

293
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
is an important activity but it should

294
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
never be the only one

295
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,160
in all kinds of testing not all bugs are

296
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
discovered

297
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,240
also we usually do not paint us

298
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
everything

299
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,079
almost always there is something in the

300
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,000
application which is not working

301
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,680
so it gets excluded from the scope uh

302
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,079
let me ask you this if you run a

303
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:50,959
penetration

304
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,240
testing once a year and

305
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,959
on the other hand uh you deploy to

306
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,600
production

307
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
new features and changes daily

308
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,600
how secure is it really and of course

309
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,160
fixings bugs just before the productions

310
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,720
uh

311
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,440
the production release uh can be costly

312
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
too

313
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,399
uh so try to push left start the

314
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,720
security activities even before you

315
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,640
write the first line of code

316
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,959
uh include security in the design phase

317
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,519
using flat modeling for example

318
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,560
uh include security in code review in

319
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,200
testing

320
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
tried out various automated tools to

321
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,279
help you

322
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,200
maybe even run an internal bike only

323
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
if not the offensive trainings i've

324
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,519
attended as a developer probably i

325
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,959
wouldn't be here with you

326
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,480
today the training sparked my interest

327
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,079
in application security and i quit my

328
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,079
job as a developer

329
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,120
my case is an exception though uh

330
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
getting back to world war ii

331
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,440
what would you teach a pirate trooper

332
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,040
well the parachute of course to fight

333
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,959
effectively being surrounded by enemy

334
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,720
forces

335
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
to shoot as well it's combat 101 not

336
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,480
only for a paratrooper

337
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,959
but you do not teach a paratrooper how

338
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,920
to drive a tank

339
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,839
you teach a paratrooper how to destroy a

340
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,440
tank and

341
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,839
the same idea should be applied uh

342
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,320
to uh developers training

343
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,040
in my opinion there are four more most

344
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,519
important aspects of a good security

345
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,760
training for developers first it should

346
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,079
be developer oriented

347
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,000
meaning it should take into account that

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
how developer works

349
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
which is mostly writing code in uh

350
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,639
visual studio on

351
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,600
any other ide uh it should not focus on

352
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,720
learning developers

353
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
how to use http proxy but it should be

354
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,839
focused on finding and fixing

355
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,079
bugs from the source code level uh

356
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,519
second

357
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,200
developers should be engaged should

358
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,560
actively

359
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,959
should be actively taking part in the

360
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,920
discussions

361
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
uh should actively exchange their

362
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,760
experience with the group and the

363
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,040
trainer third training should contain

364
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,600
tons of examples of security failures of

365
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,040
other companies

366
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,440
lots of examples of vulnerabilities

367
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
their causes

368
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,360
their consequences to make developer

369
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
aware how things might go wrong

370
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,480
in cross-site scripting is not about

371
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,760
alert

372
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,399
message but actually it's about that the

373
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,519
attacker can

374
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,920
make actions on users on victims behalf

375
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,639
and fall

376
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,160
flexible sometimes you cannot take out

377
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
the whole team for like two day long

378
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,959
workshop

379
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,760
so fight workshop which lasts one day i

380
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,079
find one which lasts two hours for four

381
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,839
consecutive days

382
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
uh without disturbing your team's

383
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,560
day-to-day activities

384
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,639
have you ever considered such a training

385
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
when each developer can

386
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,959
start stop it whenever she or he wants

387
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,800
it and finally now it

388
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,480
everything has to be online

389
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,560
what if for developers landing security

390
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,399
would be like watching netflix

391
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,320
i will get back to you after a short

392
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
commercial break

393
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
yeah i'm sure you have a lot going on

394
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,839
even during home office you have

395
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,720
hundreds of jira tickets to work with

396
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
and all those questions such as how long

397
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,079
is it going to take to complete this

398
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:24,639
task

399
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,160
i mean as much time as we need to

400
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,560
complete this test am i right

401
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,079
bug ticket fix release bug ticket

402
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,480
fix release and it goes on and on in

403
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,360
this rush you don't even

404
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,240
have time to think

405
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,040
sometimes you just have to stand aside

406
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,959
and look at the problem

407
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,720
from a different angle

408
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,000
[Music]

409
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,079
maybe even a security angle

410
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:59,839
let me show you why

411
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:15,929
[Music]

412
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,760
[Music]

413
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,839
so you want me to teach you

414
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
okay so now we know how the training

415
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,839
should look like

416
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,680
we should see which training suits soon

417
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,800
i believe offensive training makes sense

418
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
for developers only if those developers

419
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
later on can use

420
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,279
those skills in the organization i run

421
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,680
both offensive and defensive trainings

422
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
for example offensive for security

423
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,240
chambers and they really did use that

424
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,800
skills during their day-to-day job and

425
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,920
that's good

426
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,440
i wouldn't recommend training the whole

427
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,079
developer team in this way though

428
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,279
uh the team i would send to a defensive

429
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,639
training

430
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,480
uh i'd also recommend buying an access

431
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,000
uh to the online security online online

432
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,040
secure coding um platform of course

433
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
let's not forget about new hires

434
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,920
the sooner their their journey with

435
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
application security will start

436
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
the better here

437
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,440
on the picture done probably from an

438
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,320
airplane

439
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,959
we can see several tanks located near

440
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,440
the rhine river during the world war ii

441
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,240
uh it's very hard to see from this

442
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,920
picture itself

443
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,800
but all tanks look like the one on the

444
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
right side

445
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
inflatable dammit tanks designed to

446
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
confuse the enemy with the location

447
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,560
and the size of the forces you cannot

448
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,320
see it from a reconnaissance plane

449
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,120
you have to get closer and close can

450
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,880
also be too late

451
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
this position of the forces is bad

452
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,079
you're not where you're supposed to be

453
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,640
i remember one particular workshop when

454
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,319
there was a manager present

455
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,119
and he said that we uh do things this

456
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,839
way according to this internal policy

457
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,559
then suddenly from other another side of

458
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,280
the table

459
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
a senior developer spoke and he said

460
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,039
something like hell no we don't do

461
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,000
things like this

462
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,679
there's no time of course uh multiple

463
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,559
times also

464
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,840
i heard uh our app is secure

465
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,200
with the audience we have the best

466
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,039
programmers on the market we are

467
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,640
compliant with this and that we have

468
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,559
security requirements written down

469
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,480
and followed by our fabulous developers

470
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,440
yeah yeah yeah for those of you working

471
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
with software service platforms

472
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,400
uh imagine a situation where when some

473
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
potential customer

474
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,120
big fish customer like spotify knocks to

475
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,840
your door

476
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
and says we'll buy your services but

477
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,840
first

478
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,960
please kindly fill out this 500 row

479
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,360
length spreadsheet with open questions

480
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,480
about your uh security program

481
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,520
uh better be sure the answers are good

482
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,240
will check i've seen this personally and

483
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
it's hard

484
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,760
uh developers do not like feeling cells

485
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,280
hell i don't like to do that either but

486
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,919
sometimes the security departments in

487
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,840
their infinite wisdom

488
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,520
give developer selves to phil

489
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,440
this has to stop i mean compliance

490
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,039
doesn't make your app secure at least

491
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,120
not the one on paper and the one at all

492
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,760
cost

493
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,400
if you want to make those requirements

494
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
implemented you have to work together

495
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
with developers with

496
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
implementation and the verification of

497
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,880
those requirements

498
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
next thing uh the list of requires

499
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,120
requirements must be written down in the

500
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
language the developer understand

501
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,640
uh so they should be engaged in creating

502
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,039
uh such a list as well to give you an

503
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,240
example uh please

504
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,600
go and compare uh two documents one is

505
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,679
over top 10 proactive controls

506
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,120
and the second one is os top 10 list

507
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,280
to see the difference in language

508
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,280
okay to summarize what you

509
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,440
as a security people can do to change

510
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,799
the developer's view

511
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,160
of the application security

512
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,679
most important action is to work on

513
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,280
their attitude

514
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,840
you're in this together

515
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,720
and what to do first improve

516
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,240
communication make

517
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
make direct connections with them meet

518
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,280
them

519
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,400

520
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
them properly make them aware of

521
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,360
vulnerability causes and consequences

522
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,320
engage them

523
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,360

524
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,799
activities

525
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,919
a secure software development life cycle

526
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,000
is an organizational change so

527
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,159

535
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
shall fight through implementation we

536
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,360
shall fight during testing

537
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,520
we shall fight till the final release

538
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
and we must fight together

539
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,200

540
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,720
