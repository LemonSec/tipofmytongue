1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,759
hi everybody thank you so much for

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,599
having me here today

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,880
i'm going to have the opportunity to

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,720
talk to you about mind games

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,640
how we can use data to solve for the

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
human element

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,439
before we get started i'd like to tell

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
you a little bit about how i got here

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,039
and got to be

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,439
so excited to be on uh having this topic

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,040
of conversation with you

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,840
so i've spent uh close to two decades in

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,440
the security space

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,879
looking at security from a variety of

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,320
different angles started my career

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,239
working on the defense sector

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,480
um i am originally from russia so i had

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,879
a chance to work on russian apt threats

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,840
from there joined salesforce in 2012

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,120
where i got to build and run the

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,719
security engagement team

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,920
focused on all aspects of human risk

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,039
from employee good and bad behavior to

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,480
secure coding and then

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,440
security feature adoptions by customers

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,159
my

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,520
love of this question of how do we look

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
at the human element of risk took me to

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,560
starting

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,799
my own company elevate security which

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,680
today

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,400
builds and runs the world's leading

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,479
human risk management platform

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,119
that uses data and behavioral science to

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,280
change employees behavior

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,040
but throughout my entire career i've

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,200
been really focused on the question

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,119
of how do we people how do we get people

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,960
to want to do security instead of have

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,680
to

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,280
how do we evolve this conversation from

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
just a check box and compliance driven

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
orient oriented problem to one in which

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,159
our employees are part of the defense

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,759
network

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,600
so one of the things that i've noticed

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,960
trying to solve this problem

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,560
time and time again from different

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
organizations and and

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,759
both as a practitioner now owning a

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,040
company

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,479
is that i have come to believe that

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,799
human risk is one of the

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,079
largest unsolved problems in security

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,360
and the reason i say this is because if

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,038
you open up the verizon data

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,480
breach report at any point in the last

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,599
10 years

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
you're going to find that elements

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,599
related to human factor

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,200
human error malicious or unintentional

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
lead to some of the top reasons why

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
breaches are successful year after year

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,800
this year is no exception in 2020 these

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,440
are the

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,560
statistics of common buckets of

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
attack vectors that we have seen be

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,000
successful in breaches and

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
so many of them have human error

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
associated with them

71
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
and it's not an exception this year if

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
you take a look at the ones that are

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,040
trending at the very top you see that

74
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,440
it's

75
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,879
social phishing hacking and use of soul

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,480
and credentials

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,599
and things like technical issues malware

78
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,920
in this particular case has gone down

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,640
whereas

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
the top ranking one two and three all

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,519
have human factors associated with it

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,480
and the reason i think it is this uh

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,159
prominent and the question

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,680
that we started this conversation with

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
from pewter is

86
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,680
there it's it's this big of a problem is

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,959
because human risk

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,599
is the largest unexplored problem in

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,040
security

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,159
we just assume easily we say hey

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,720
human beings are the weakest link let's

92
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
design around them but we haven't really

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
dug in and say

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,319
well why and what's effective and how

95
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:28,879
can we

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,319
unpack it and today if any of you have

97
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,319
ever worked for an organization that is

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,840
large or compliance driven

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,519
you inevitably have gone through some

100
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,680
type of mandatory security training

101
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,080
that makes you feel exactly like this we

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
mute it we skip to the end and we guess

103
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,599
this quiz question and that's our best

104
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,080
in class

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,560
approach to the space and it's

106
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
incredibly hard to measure in a one size

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
fits all and we haven't

108
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
really gotten off of this hamster wheel

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,120
of

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,239
um solution or best practice

111
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,519
trying to address one of our largest

112
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
problems so what i'm going to do in the

113
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,640
rest of this talk

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,000
is walk through how we can use

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
the data we have in our organizations to

116
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
understand where to look for human risk

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,239
understand what approaches that are

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,360
current we're currently using

119
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,399
to be effective or not and uh what kind

120
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,918
of remediation techniques might actually

121
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,600
be effective

122
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,959
so the first thing that i wanted to

123
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,960
start this conversation with is

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,160
a review of a study that i

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,720
came across from a couple years ago done

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,520
in 2014 by dr caputo

127
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,160
and she ran one of the most extensive

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,040
research

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,280
questions i have seen on this particular

130
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,240
topic

131
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
and so what the study did was it sent

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,160
three targeted spear phishing emails

133
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,639
to over 1500 employees over course of

134
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,840
several months

135
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
and the hypothesis of this particular

136
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,759
test was that

137
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,600
if you made a mistake and clicked on the

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,919
phishing link you would pop up

139
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,360
you would have a training pop-up that

140
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
would tell you what you did wrong

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,919
and the idea here is that this type of

142
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,280
experiment would lower the

143
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,000
the rate of click clicking spear

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,479
phishing

145
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,600
emails and increased reporting seems

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
logical it's the best practice that many

147
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,880
of our organizations do

148
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,080
but this was the first test that

149
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,840
actually wanted to see if it was

150
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,880
effective and if

151
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
we're putting forth effective

152
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
remediations

153
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,479
and what they found oh this and this was

154
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,639
the email that they sent out right so

155
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,880
um for if you clicked on the link and

156
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,639
you need you got training you got the

157
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,039
right

158
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
you got to the right uh right hand side

159
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160
training on the left

160
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
was just the control group just to see

161
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
if the training was effective

162
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,600
and so what they ended up finding

163
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
was was quite surprising first

164
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,160
they found either all or none of the

165
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,479
employees

166
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,400
mostly they grouped themselves into

167
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,520
cohorts

168
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,639
and as an employee you either clicked on

169
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,639
almost all the emails or none of the

170
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,680
emails so you're

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
very likely to have similar patternings

172
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
across all three

173
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
next the way you performed on your first

174
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,960
email was very good indication of how

175
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,240
you're going to perform

176
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,720
all subsequent spear phishing tests

177
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
after

178
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,479
and they found that the training had no

179
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,840
significant effect

180
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,400
on whether or not it impacted your

181
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
likelihood to

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,759
click on future links and everybody

183
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,400
spent

184
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
mere seconds on the training if at all

185
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
showing that they did not retain any of

186
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,919
the content

187
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,160
so if this was the case and these were

188
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,360
the findings

189
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,280
one of the things that i wanted to say i

190
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
wanted to take a look at this and

191
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,039
was can we take this research and

192
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,880
explore it further

193
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,280
so if everyone is either clicking on

194
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,880
links or not clicking on links in

195
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,319
cohorts and we can predict

196
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
based on how they perform once can we

197
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,599
see how they're going to perform the

198
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,560
future

199
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,039
can we use this information to actually

200
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,639
predict good and bad security

201
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,960
performance across security behaviors

202
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
and if training doesn't matter how do we

203
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
design more effective interventions

204
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,560
to change these actions so let's start

205
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
with the first question

206
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,039
the team at elevate security and i posed

207
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,360
this particular question to ourselves

208
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
and before i get into what we find found

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,280
i wanted to tell you a little bit

210
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,880
about our research methodology to give

211
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
you some context as to how we came to

212
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,080
our conclusions

213
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
so at elevate security we integrate with

214
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,280
a variety of

215
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,759
existing security tools in enterprise

216
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,680
networks that can map to security

217
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
actions of employees

218
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,840
so what we are doing is is integrating

219
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
security events done by employees both

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
good and bad across a variety of

221
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
different behaviors

222
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,840
we then map that information against hr

223
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,080
hierarchy so we can create key maps of

224
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,680
what's happening that's good or bad in

225
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
an organization

226
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,039
and so we are taking a data set which to

227
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,479
the best of my knowledge is one of the

228
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
most robust in the world today

229
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,240
and has over a million different

230
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,000
behavioral actions

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,879
done by over 80 000 different employees

232
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,160
across the globe

233
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,720
and observed over 18 months and the

234
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,160
behavioral actions that i'm talking

235
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,919
about are listed here on the right hand

236
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,160
side you can see we're taking a look at

237
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,520
five different categories um for mock

238
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,199
and real world phishing whether or not

239
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,560
someone opened clicked

240
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,440
compromised or reported the email when

241
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,039
they took training was it late or on

242
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,759
time was it mandatory or voluntary

243
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,759
for password managers and this is

244
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,520
primarily

245
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
a software-based password managers like

246
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,440
a lastpass for example

247
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,279
do they have they account set up and do

248
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
they actively use it

249
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
and are they receiving personalist

250
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,000
scorecard which

251
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,279
i'll get into a little bit more detail

252
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,599
later on and from an hr perspective

253
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,200
we're looking at a variety of different

254
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
aspects of the employee

255
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
how long have they been with the company

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
their tenure where are they

257
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,160
in geography where they from a

258
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
department are they manager

259
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,080
and what's their employment status so

260
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
this is how we slice this data set

261
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
and the first thing we want to say was

262
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,640
does your hr data predict where you are

263
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,250
going to

264
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,720
[Music]

265
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,000
how you're going to act on security

266
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
actions so the first thing we wanted to

267
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
see was who's the most likely to use a

268
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
password manager so we built this

269
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
decision tree

270
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
where we slice the pool of data based on

271
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,360
the most predictive attributes

272
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
in the data set and the way you can read

273
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,560
this is

274
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
by looking at this tree and everything

275
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
that falls to the left

276
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,440
answers yes to the question dividing the

277
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
data and everything that falls to the

278
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
right answer is no

279
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
so the first thing we asked was are you

280
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,600
outside of the ux and so we're splitting

281
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,000
the data

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,040
based on geography from there we are

283
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,000
locating

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
are you outside of europe or have you

285
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
been in the company less than two years

286
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680
and then from there we're splitting it

287
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,600
up on a variety of different tenure

288
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
lengths in the company and what we're

289
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,040
finding is that

290
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,760
there's two groups that are show

291
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
statistically interesting

292
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,959
likelihoods of using a password manager

293
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,040
and so what that some what we could see

294
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,000
from our data set

295
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,480
is that employees in the asia-pacific

296
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,600
region

297
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
uh who have been with the company longer

298
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
than 1.3 years

299
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,200
are least likely to use a password

300
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,480
manager

301
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,560
employees that are in the united states

302
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,760
with the company that

303
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,320
uh with the company the longer 1.3 years

304
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,839
are most likely to use a password

305
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,040
manager

306
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,560
and uh geography was the strongest

307
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,480
indicator of likelihood whereas tenure

308
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,760
uh had very a very slight predictor on

309
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,000
the

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
outcome of whether or not you're going

311
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,279
to be using it

312
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,000
so that's a password manager next we

313
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
wanted to see about phishing attacks

314
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,959
similarly we built a decision tree and

315
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,399
we split the data first

316
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,079
on whether or not you're relatively new

317
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,200
to the company have you been with the

318
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,519
company less than

319
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,320
2.5 years are you full-time or outside

320
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,120
the u.s

321
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
and then a variety of other different

322
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
attributes

323
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,959
and what we found was again two cohorts

324
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,120
that were likely

325
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
least likely and most likely to click

326
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
and to summarize the data

327
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
we found that short tenured contractors

328
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
on large teams

329
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,200
were most likely to click on phishing

330
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
links

331
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
the least likely were employees in the

332
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
united states who had been in the

333
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,399
company

334
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
more than three years but less uh than

335
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,320
16.

336
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
so again if you were in the company that

337
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
in a company relatively new so

338
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,640
more less than six years or more than 16

339
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,000
years so you've been there for a long

340
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,720
time you were much more likely to click

341
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,200
and

342
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
and tenure of all of the attributes that

343
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,959
we could slice the data

344
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,670
tenure was the most

345
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,360
[Music]

346
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,680
most likely most predictive element

347
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
so those were based on hr data and the

348
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,040
next question

349
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
and the area where a lot of our future

350
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,560
research is leaning into is

351
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,880
can we predict what you're going to do

352
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,240
in the future based on how you've

353
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,480
predicted have you acted in the past

354
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,639
and one of the data sets that we had was

355
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,399
training and whether or not you

356
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,680
completed training on time or late

357
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,480
what we found is that employees who

358
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
completed all their security training

359
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,120
on time had a phishing click-through

360
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,639
rate of about nine percent so they were

361
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,399
detecting it about 91 percent and

362
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
reporting it about 48

363
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
of the time those employees who

364
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
regularly completed a security training

365
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,120
late

366
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,480
uh had um uh clicked on it

367
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
clicked on phishing links 11 of the time

368
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
and reported only 42

369
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,200
of the time with with a delta of 2.2 and

370
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
5.8 respectively

371
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,240
and while this statistic alone doesn't

372
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,880
have

373
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
like you could say well two percent

374
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,639
isn't significant when you multiply it

375
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,839
first and forms by

376
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,600
an employee base of hundreds of

377
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
thousands that

378
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,560
that amplifies pretty quickly but then

379
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,639
this is just this one particular factor

380
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,600
distilled

381
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,519
now if you take a look at of the other

382
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,519
attributes that we just discovered

383
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,760
so if you let's say you were a newly

384
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,120
tenured employee

385
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,519
located outside of the united states

386
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,760
who's regularly laid on training

387
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,000
all of those compound to help paint a

388
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,120
picture of

389
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,040
you being a high risk employee as it

390
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,079
relates to security actions

391
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,519
so those were our our findings

392
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,320
on can we predict good and bad security

393
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,680
behavior based on

394
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,560
attributes around your who you are as an

395
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,760
employee

396
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,959
the next question we wanted to ask is

397
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,839
well how do we define more effect design

398
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
more effective interventions

399
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,600
if you go back to the very first study

400
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,959
that we covered at the beginning with

401
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,519
the 1500 spear phishing emails

402
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,800
one of the findings from that from that

403
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,959
study was that almost nobody

404
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,240
stayed on the training more than a

405
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
couple of seconds

406
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,720
so even if people clicked we could not

407
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,839
get their attention

408
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,680
long enough to even give them the

409
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
knowledge and information we need for

410
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
them to change their behavior

411
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,839
now why is that we historically

412
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
as a security uh practitioners

413
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,959
believe that only our employees or our

414
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,160
workforce

415
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,519
knew uh how to do something differently

416
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,720
they would just totally do it

417
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
differently they it's just it's a

418
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,760
knowledge gap

419
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,639
if only they knew about how dangerous it

420
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,079
was to reuse a password they would

421
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,680
absolutely

422
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,000
no longer release passwords but what we

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
have come to find

424
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,079
year after year is that knowing is not

425
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,440
enough

426
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,800
and lastpass we did a really great

427
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
study a couple years ago where they

428
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,639
demonstrated this incredibly well

429
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,360
they found that they surveyed hundreds

430
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,680
of

431
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
their users in their platform and they

432
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,079
found that a significant proportion of

433
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:50,880
their input

434
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
of their user base knew what a secure uh

435
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
knew all about secure passwords and that

436
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,440
why it was important

437
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,639
understood the risk of reusing it um and

438
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,040
yet

439
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,320
still to chose to reuse passwords or

440
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,079
find or have really easy to remember

441
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,000
passwords so

442
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,760
the difference between knowledge and

443
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,040
action is

444
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,079
significant and is one of the

445
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,760
things that we need to be taking into

446
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,240
account as we design for these

447
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,440
uh types of interventions if knowing was

448
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,839
enough

449
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,240
everyone who who smoked would probably

450
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,079
quit smoking because it's on all of the

451
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,839
packaging and all the labels and we know

452
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,680
that smoking kills us and yet we still

453
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,440
do this right so

454
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,959
uh human beings are just complex

455
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,759
so if knowing isn't enough what's the

456
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,519
missing puzzle piece here

457
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
if if not if if we don't if we don't

458
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
need to just be giving our employees

459
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,480
more training with

460
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,440
just more information what do we need to

461
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,720
be giving them

462
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,000
and that last puzzle piece is motivation

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
if i don't care i don't care how much i

464
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,279
know

465
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,680
about this particular object or if i

466
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
like if i don't care to take action if i

467
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,279
don't care to learn or course correct

468
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,560
i'm never going to do it and

469
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,079
there's in behavioral science a

470
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,320
fundamental formula that i want to share

471
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
with you all

472
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,560
that dictates this particular phenomenon

473
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,000
and what it says is that for

474
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,519
anybody to change a habit or a behavior

475
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,360
three things need to exist at the exact

476
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,560
same time

477
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
in the right amount in order for that

478
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,920
action to happen

479
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,639
first i need to have the motivation to

480
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,920
do that action

481
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,480
second i need to have the ability to do

482
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,160
that action and third i need to be

483
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,120
reminded

484
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
so if i really want to become an

485
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,720
excellent long-distance runner i need to

486
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,639
really have the motivation to do it i

487
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,720
really either want to get fit or

488
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
achieve a personal goal i need to have

489
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,920
the ability i need to have really good

490
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,839
running shoes and two legs that aren't

491
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,320
broken

492
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
to do this and the last is i need a

493
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,000
reminder

494
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,759
i need either a calendar reminder or a

495
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
friend to go running with or

496
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,320
time in my day where i regularly do this

497
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,079
because without the combination of those

498
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,799
three things at the same time

499
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,280
that's just not going to happen and when

500
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
we think about motivation

501
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,319
in context for how we

502
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,839
um how we are tackling security

503
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,520
and again back to the very first study

504
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,959
that we covered

505
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,880
we need motivation in our employees

506
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,520
first to want to not click on the email

507
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,880
and to report

508
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
and when they do we need to give them

509
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,360
the motivation to want a course correct

510
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,760
want to consume the knowledge and the

511
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,880
behavior change and

512
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,960
actually apply the things that we are

513
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,559
teaching them so those are

514
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,280
two discrete buckets of motivation that

515
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,799
we need to be considering

516
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,360
applying to our employees so

517
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
i'm going to give you in the second half

518
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
of this presentation three motivational

519
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,760
hacks

520
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,640
that i have seen in my career be

521
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,600
extremely

522
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,720
effective in getting employees to buy in

523
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,360
to changing security actions they can be

524
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,799
all used in

525
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,320
combination or individually the first

526
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,440
is social proof social proof

527
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,799
is a concept in psychology

528
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,520
that really leverages the fact that

529
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,000
everyone

530
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
else is doing it so i should as well we

531
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,919
think about this in the back of our mind

532
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,320
uh

533
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,440
unconsciously and anal and

534
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
advertising and marketing have come to

535
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,480
leverage this

536
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,600
extremely efficiently um in getting us

537
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,240
to

538
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,360
in driving our purchases so one of the

539
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,400
top examples

540
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
is let's say in a purchase on amazon for

541
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,799
example and you can see

542
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,400
oh well this particular thing has 79

543
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,280
5 star reviews it must be good so i

544
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,400
should buy this

545
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,360
uh the concept of peer reviews and stars

546
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,080
leverages

547
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,200
against social proof uh the concept

548
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,320
of um if any of you

549
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,600
have booked uh hotels online uh

550
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,919
they use social proof all the time you

551
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,840
can see on this particular screenshot

552
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,080
it's in high demand it was booked 41

553
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,039
times in the last

554
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,880
24 hours uh there's only six rooms left

555
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,600
and so

556
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,760
you're driving this mentality of

557
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
everyone else thinks this is a good deal

558
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
i should as well

559
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
um also using reviews number of reviews

560
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,760
and score

561
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,640
and then the last is something that the

562
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
united states rolled out a couple of

563
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,280
years ago

564
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,320
and it is a energy bill report that

565
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,440
that a

566
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,039
people in neighborhoods get and what it

567
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,440
does is it rates your energy consumption

568
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,000
compared to

569
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,640
your neighbors and it also compares to

570
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,400
your most efficient neighbors

571
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,960
so you can see how how good you are

572
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,240
compared to

573
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,559
your best performing energy-saving

574
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,520
neighbors

575
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,679
and what you can do differently so again

576
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,320
all leveraging social proof

577
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
now this has also been done in security

578
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
before

579
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,520
a couple years ago the georgia institute

580
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,480
of technology

581
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,559
in partnership with facebook rolled out

582
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,159
this particular experiment where they

583
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,520
were trying to drive the security

584
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,640
feature adoption

585
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,880
of of mfa for personal accounts

586
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,200
and for subset of users what they did

587
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
was they put up a controlled

588
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
text that said mfa is really good and

589
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,039
important for your account please turn

590
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,400
it on

591
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,360
and in in comparison they rolled out to

592
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,480
a subset of

593
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,760
of uh users um something

594
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,159
using social proof and it and it showed

595
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,919
how many people in their network were

596
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,720
already using this particular security

597
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
feature so in this case 108 of your

598
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,159
friends are doing this

599
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,000
and they found that the social context

600
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
one was 1.36 times

601
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,280
more successful in getting employees to

602
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,400
adopt that particular security feature

603
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,919
similarly uh in the elevate platform

604
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,520
what we do for the security

605
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,400
behaviors that we pull into our

606
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
ecosystem

607
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,480
is we compare a specific security action

608
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,360
like fishing uh click-through rates and

609
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,559
reporting rates

610
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,080
compared to an employee's department

611
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,000
their company and the best performer in

612
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
their organization

613
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
and places where they're above the

614
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,200
threshold better than their department

615
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,039
they get badges and accolades and i'm

616
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
going to talk about that in a second

617
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,000
and then if they are below a threshold

618
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,159
if they are doing worse

619
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
they're given the specific actions to

620
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,600
follow up um

621
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,640
around what they need to do but this is

622
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,159
particularly impactful because instead

623
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,039
of saying hey

624
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,720
you're you suck at phishing here's

625
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
training the language is much more

626
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,760
effective of

627
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,840
you are much more likely than the rest

628
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,280
of your department

629
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,200
so here's some training and so it is

630
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,120
motivation to take

631
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
the next action around course correcting

632
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
for that behavior

633
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,039
similarly we use a variant of social

634
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,960
proof called celebrity social proof

635
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
which highlights someone

636
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
uh famous or important in your

637
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,840
organization

638
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,880
uh doing something great so we use

639
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,640
again advertising marketing sees this

640
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,120
all the time where famous sports stars

641
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,760
are using a specific type of sports

642
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,360
sneakers and you and you think oh

643
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,679
that must be a good sneaker why not for

644
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,720
security

645
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,440
and say hey did you know that your uh

646
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,840
ceo is using a password manager

647
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,480
you should too uh and so this short

648
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,280
changes

649
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,039
the short circuits a lot of well i don't

650
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,480
know is it good for me

651
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,559
it's i've heard mixed reviews it models

652
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,679
what great looks like

653
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,640
by someone who you admire and respect

654
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,520
the trick is

655
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,960
actually picking somebody that you

656
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
admire and respect

657
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,919
for this particular type of activity so

658
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,640
that's

659
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,480
that is social proof the next uh

660
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,080
motivational hack that i wanted to walk

661
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,200
through with you all is gamification

662
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,000
now just to level set gamification is

663
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,400
not

664
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
about playing games at work it's not

665
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,240
about turning on

666
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
a video game in a work environment

667
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,919
playing with your colleagues

668
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,280
what gamification is is unpacking what

669
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,760
makes

670
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,440
gaming successful those game mechanics

671
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,640
and applying them to get to business

672
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,679
results

673
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,080
because gaming has figured out to the

674
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,120
tune of a

675
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,679
multi-billion dollar industry how to get

676
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,559
people to be

677
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,080
engaged and motivated and want to

678
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,400
continue to do this action so there

679
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,440
is a magic formula that gaming uses

680
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,559
to get its players bought into the

681
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,840
ecosystem

682
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,120
and those can be unpacked and applied

683
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,159
to not game environments

684
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,440
let me show you what that actually looks

685
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,080
like before i get into those

686
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
examples i want to show you what those

687
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,600
five magic elements are

688
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,440
the first in order to make any game

689
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,039
successful but then applying this

690
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,240
outside of the game

691
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,960
environment the first is autonomy we

692
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,640
have to have choices

693
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,880
you can't the difference between saying

694
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,640
get me a cup of coffee and will you

695
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,400
please get me a cup of coffee

696
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
register so significantly differently in

697
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,600
my brain

698
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,320
and how willing i am to get you a cup of

699
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,159
coffee

700
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,919
will change based on whether or not

701
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,360
you've given me a choice

702
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,279
autonomy mastery in gaming environment

703
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,080
and in life

704
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
it's not necessarily about getting to

705
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,440
the finale it's

706
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,960
if it's if we enjoy the journey then

707
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,880
we actually enjoy the process

708
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,320
of getting better and better and so um

709
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,840
this is in gaming why we like to

710
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
level up time of time not just win the

711
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,880
game

712
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
and the way we do that and get to

713
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,559
mastery is through feedback

714
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,360
we need to understand where we have gone

715
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,919
wrong

716
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,039
and how we get better at it

717
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,200
and having tight feedback loops is one

718
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,960
of the best most effective ways of

719
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
getting us to mastery

720
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,360
purpose is important if we if we

721
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,279
understand why what we're doing connects

722
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,080
to something

723
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,559
bigger than us and if we are in

724
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,159
connection with others

725
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,760
so what this looks like from a business

726
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
perspective

727
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
i've put together four examples that we

728
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
see often in our environments

729
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,919
the first is airline miles airline miles

730
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,520
is one of the most classic examples of

731
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,679
gamification

732
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,760
they have figured out how to route us

733
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,880
through air

734
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,760
ports and on certain airlines to get to

735
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,480
points

736
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,159
and achieve status and to maintain

737
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,360
our um to maintain

738
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,720
our red carpet was blue carpet kind of

739
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,279
boarding

740
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,480
right so great example of gamification

741
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,520
fitbit and any other type of exercising

742
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,559
trackers

743
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,320
have also done a great job where they're

744
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,760
using leaderboards

745
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,120
and um talking about how you've leveled

746
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,760
up

747
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,840
similarly you're at your gamifying

748
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,960
fitness

749
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,360
even your linkedin profile is gamified

750
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,159
where you can say

751
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,640
oh you're almost my profile strength is

752
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,840
intermediate i'm

753
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
almost too advanced i just need to do

754
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,120
two more things so again

755
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,000
how am i what's my feedback how far am i

756
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,440
from mastery

757
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
um what is the impact of what i need to

758
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,039
be doing

759
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,039
it says members with the photos get 21

760
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,520
percent 21 times more profits

761
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,080
so you're connecting this with with why

762
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,360
i'm doing it

763
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,760
and the last is is loyalty cards to your

764
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,840
favorite coffee shop right so

765
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,080
buy 10 get the 11th free and so you're

766
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,679
gamifying

767
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,000
loyalty and purchasing of coffee so

768
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,520
these are all ways we've seen this show

769
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,960
up in our environment

770
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,080
let's take a look at what it looks like

771
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,640
in security so

772
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,720
well one of the ways that we like to

773
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,400
communicate security

774
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,279
uh gamification levels is through the

775
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,640
security strength

776
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,520
um scores so instead of saying hey you

777
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,679
suck at security and say hey

778
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,360
you're tenuous or you're flimsy and

779
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,120
you need to get to indestructible so

780
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
this is the security strength

781
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,320
um and understanding how far you are for

782
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,520
mastery

783
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,840
on the right hand side similar type of

784
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,320
leaderboards but we found it effective

785
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,159
to for um leaders in departments

786
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,320
to compare their overall security

787
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,200
strength

788
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,840
compared to their peers and this is at a

789
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
department level so you're aggregating

790
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,720
everyone's score

791
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,399
you're grouping it on and together and

792
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,240
so what you're doing is comparing

793
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,399
how all of marketing is doing compared

794
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,919
to finance

795
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,200
i have found that this level of

796
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,640
competition is unbelievably effective

797
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,000
for uh sales people and executives

798
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,559
and then the last thing the one in the

799
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,279
middle

800
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,399
is a group accountability a group

801
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,360
scorecard

802
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,640
um and this leverages a gamification

803
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
principle called streaks

804
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,480
so for safety environments um

805
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,520
places like oil and gas or manufacturing

806
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,360
safety is their number one uh focus

807
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,679
and so what they have done and many of

808
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,120
you are probably familiar with this is

809
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,440
number of days since last accident right

810
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,120
why can't we do something like this for

811
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
security so

812
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,679
can you say number of days since last

813
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,799
fishing

814
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,720
click through by an employee and it's

815
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,799
anonymous but it resets

816
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,159
and so if you click on a link and so

817
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,559
what you what it does is it gives me

818
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,240
personal motivation as an employee

819
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,840
before i get a phishing link

820
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,399
say or as i get a phishing link before i

821
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,440
click on it

822
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,960
to actually make me pause and ask

823
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,399
do i want to be the person that resets

824
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,080
this clock what if i'm wrong

825
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,960
so all of these are giving employees

826
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,480
motivation

827
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,640
to pause their routine and say

828
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,360
i maybe i should change my behavior how

829
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,880
how should i be thinking about this

830
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,559
differently

831
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,360
so that is gamification and all the

832
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,279
different flavors of it

833
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,799
and the last that i wanted to share with

834
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,360
you is positive reinforcement

835
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,080
now positive reinforcement is actually

836
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,760
kind of a foreign concept for us as

837
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,679
security practitioners

838
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,000
we have this concept of a carrot versus

839
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
a stick so

840
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,000
i can either encourage you to do this

841
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,399
with

842
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,799
a recognition reward or i can punish you

843
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,960
for you to not do this

844
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
um i want to unpack this in a little bit

845
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,799
more detail and show you what it looks

846
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,440
like in

847
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,880
more and more uh behavioral science

848
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,000
terms

849
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,200
so uh negative reinforcement

850
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,559
is when we strengthen a behavior so that

851
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,720
we avoid a negative outcome

852
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,480
the behavior that it's shown in this

853
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
particular example is putting on

854
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,120
sunscreen

855
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,399
i don't put on sunscreen because i

856
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,480
particularly enjoy putting on sunscreen

857
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
but i really don't like getting

858
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,919
sunburned so i

859
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,840
am putting on sunscreen to avoid the

860
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,640
negative outcome of getting sunburned

861
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,520
and just to foreshadow a little bit here

862
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,559
almost

863
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,880
all of the ways that we engage with our

864
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,679
employees

865
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,600
is negative reinforcement and i'll talk

866
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,360
about that in a second

867
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,159
now positive reinforcement is the

868
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:02,960
opposite of that

869
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,360
is when a good behavior happens we

870
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,960
reinforce that by giving

871
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,480
applaud accolades for that good behavior

872
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,200
we train our pets all the time with this

873
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
we train our children

874
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,480
um on a variety of different different

875
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,840
behaviors to do this why not our

876
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,960
employees this is something that we

877
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,520
apply as

878
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,320
parents as pet owners but not as peers

879
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:26,880
and

880
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,600
in the workforce and so when we think

881
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,320
about it from a securities perspective

882
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,559
almost all the interactions that an

883
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,559
employee gets from us

884
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,080
is negative reinforcement so we use

885
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,279
training as the punishment

886
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,200
so um when i click on a phishing link

887
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,279
i get training and so the best that i

888
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,679
can do is i'm avoiding fishing

889
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,080
to not get training so in this case

890
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,960
training

891
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,519
is the sunburn part in in our brain and

892
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,799
that's how we're wiring it

893
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,200
and reward is the absence of that

894
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,880
training so why in the world would i

895
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,120
ever spend any extra time on that like

896
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,039
that doesn't feel like it's a desirable

897
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,480
end state

898
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,000
if you think about other types of

899
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,679
interactions we have as

900
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,519
security teams reset my password or you

901
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,360
reset your password in this time manner

902
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,799
or you will get locked out

903
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,880
follow this policy or you're going to

904
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
get sent to hr

905
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,559
take this training or your account will

906
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,720
be locked out so everything i'm doing

907
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,440
is to avoid a negative outcome what

908
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,120
happens when i do something great where

909
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,039
is the positive reinforcement

910
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,039
nothing almost all the time it is

911
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,640
silence

912
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,519
and i do not get any recognition for

913
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,640
detecting

914
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,919
flawlessly my all the phishing attacks

915
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,440
in my inbox

916
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,279
making sure that malware never gets

917
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,799
introduced on my machine

918
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,519
patching regularly on on time there is

919
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,519
no type of recognition for that

920
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,960
even though that is probably outside of

921
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,559
most of my job

922
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,039
day-to-day job activities and so what

923
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,039
you're seeing here is an example of how

924
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,960
we can take the same behavior

925
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,360
which is getting people to not click on

926
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,159
phishing

927
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,039
and changing the way we address this so

928
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,720
you clicked on a link now take training

929
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,640
negative reinforcement

930
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,399
or at the end of a month that said hey

931
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,000
you actually we fished you

932
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
twice this month and you detected all of

933
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,679
them thank you so much

934
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,519
and so it gets recognized at an all

935
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,120
hands or from ceo

936
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,080
or cc to a manager but your behavior

937
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,279
gets recognized

938
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,120
and and applauded so

939
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,879
it's a way of being being seen

940
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,600
just to wrap this particular section up

941
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,960
is what we're seeing

942
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,000
in this particular study is that in 2000

943
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,760
in in study done in 2014

944
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,240
this research paper found that it is

945
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,320
possible to change behavior with both

946
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,240
negative and positive reinforcement and

947
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,399
punishment can be effective

948
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,440
however the long-term implications

949
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,000
of of using negative reinforcement can

950
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,679
be in fact quite painful

951
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,840
because it has a downside on the morale

952
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,039
of employees

953
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,120
and positive reinforcement not only

954
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
changes behavior but also

955
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,799
encourages enthusiasm and engagement

956
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,080
getting people to want to do the action

957
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,840
one of the things that we have done

958
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
again over these types of be

959
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,279
over this length of time that we've

960
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,519
observed these behaviors is that using

961
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,080
a combination of gamification social

962
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,159
proof and positive reinforcement

963
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,799
has led to these types of behavioral

964
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,720
change outcomes in the employee

965
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
populations that we are tracking

966
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,200
so we we from our perspective at elevate

967
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
have seen significant impacts

968
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,200
in this particular in in using these

969
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,120
types of approaches

970
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,080
and so just to summarize the a lot of

971
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,519
different topics we covered in

972
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,200
in the talk today can we

973
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,480
predict um whether or not employees are

974
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,840
going to be

975
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,480
falling into a cohort of good or bad

976
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,200
behavior

977
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,720
and the answer to that question is in

978
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,600
fact we can we've seen that tenure

979
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,840
has a really great correlation to

980
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,679
phishing resiliency

981
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,320
and employees who are relatively new to

982
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,119
the company or

983
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,079
very tenured tend to perform the worst

984
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,199
geography

985
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,079
is for now an indication of password

986
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,599
manager adoption

987
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,719
and that late training security training

988
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,599
correlates to how resilient you are both

989
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,719
phishing click-through rates and

990
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,320
reporting

991
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,239
and when we take a look at how we

992
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,679
remediate and change

993
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,159
employees actions on this we want to

994
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,599
leverage

995
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,560
um the motivational parts not just

996
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,520
getting people to

997
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,800
know what they need to be doing the

998
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,040
ability but also getting them to want to

999
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,760
do it

1000
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,359
because we're going to see significant

1001
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,960
changes here

1002
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
in outcomes and using techniques like

1003
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,560
social proof gamification

1004
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,320
positive reinforcement to achieve that

1005
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,800
behavior change

1006
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,920
we are constantly researching this topic

1007
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,119
and as we get more insights and data

1008
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,040
we published this on our website here so

1009
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,800
