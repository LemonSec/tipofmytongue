today welcome to

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,800
supercharge your purple team exercises

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,680
with threat

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
intelligence today i'm going to talk

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,600
about

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,039
cyber threat intelligence or cti

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,960
and how that can contribute to purple

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
team exercises

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
so i'm xena olson also known as cheerio

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,800
on twitter i'm a blue team village

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,960
senior lead a doctoral student

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,800
in cyber security at marymount

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,000
university

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
a cyber threat intelligence analyst a

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,320
sans women's academy graduate

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
i have an mba and it management 7g

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,480
excerpts

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,719
and i'm a huge fan of all things purple

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,520
um so i'm going to be sharing a lot of

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,239
really good resources in this talk so

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,280
i created a repo just for you

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,519
and it's at the bitly link there on the

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,320
slide so

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,680
confidencecon conf 2020

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,080
but before we get started i have a

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,880
really quick

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,158
note from the lawyers

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,840
so i'm not speaking on behalf of my

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,799
employers

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,840
the opinions i express are mine alone

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,360
i am here in my own individual capacity

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,640
and the use of size purple team exercise

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
framework later in this talk

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,520
does not endorse them as a vendor okay

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
so since covid and the pandemic

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,880
i think most of us at least i have been

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,360
staying

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,399
in so i decided to make a really fun

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:48,880
talk

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,399
and bring the party to you so to set the

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,520
theme of this talk

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,759
i'll be using lyrics from various deep

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,719
house and

46
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,840
chill artists i'll be taking you

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,040
out for a night on the town

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,000
to show you purple teaming from a cti

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,439
perspective

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,758
i'll take you to the party the after

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,038
party and

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,920
the after after party i also made a

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,319
custom spotify playlist with all the

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,959
songs

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,360
i used in this presentation along with a

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
few extras

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
so you can find the link to the spotify

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
playlist

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
on the github repo at the bitly link

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,480
so uh we are going to be

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,080
the stars of our night out as we

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,160
build out intelligence driven purple

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,239
team exercises

64
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
and just just in fyi uh this in this

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,680
talk

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
i will not focus on the microsoft's

67
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,080
the targets the walmarts the googles of

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,120
the world

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,319
and by that meaning organizations that i

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,000
imagine in my head

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,040
have a super mature purple team but

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,840
instead

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
i'm going to be focusing on pretty much

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
everyone else

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,159
so first i'm going to discuss some

76
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,840
issues related to purple

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
so if you're lucky enough to have a

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
purple team at your org

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
or even resources dedicated to purple

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,760
team exercises

81
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,640
you'll find that there might be some

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,599
disagreements

83
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,959
with what purple is and what purple does

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,680
so i've heard of some places doing

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,159
continuous testing of controls

86
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,440
as a form of purple team exercise i've

87
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,840
heard

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
of other places running full team purple

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
exercises with blue

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,239
and red i've heard of red emulating the

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,400
latest thread actor in the news

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,840
to see where their org is in the event

93
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
of an attack

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,840
and then i've also heard of people

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,760
testing the various techniques

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,799
and sub-techniques of miter attack

97
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,840
as part of a purple exercise

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
and i'm sure there's variations of this

99
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,319
of everything that i shared so basically

100
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,480
purple is really unique to the

101
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,400
organization

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,040
also there are varying degrees of purple

103
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,840
maturity

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
so i will be focusing on the orgs

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,000
that are willing to tackle intelligence

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,840
driven purple team exercises

107
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
the other great thing about purple is

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,919
that

109
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
uh especially with blue and red teams

110
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
it's really important that they

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,440
collaborate

112
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
it leads to not only the sharing of

113
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,960
ideas and increasing skill sets but

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,600
most importantly improvement in the

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
security posture

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,160
of the organization

117
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
so how can you justify

118
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
intelligence driven purple team

119
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,440
exercises

120
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
at your org when purple looks so

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
different at every single org and

122
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,360
another question how can

123
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,520
intelligence-driven

124
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,560
exercises help teams collaborate

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
and drive improvement at the

126
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,080
organization so

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,960
i'll offer you some ideas in this talk

128
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,840
that you can take

129
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
back to your org to help you improve

130
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,840
your security posture

131
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,960
so we'll start the evening evening out

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,720
with some deep house

133
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,800
to ease you into the purple team

134
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
exercise framework

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,280
then we'll turn up the volume with some

136
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
bass boosted threat intelligence content

137
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,320
and then we'll finish out the night with

138
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560
some chill out music for the after party

139
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,400
and the after after party

140
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
so we are going to use the purple team

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,479
exercise framework

142
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,680
in this talk to help step through

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,199
a purple team exercise to show you how

144
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,199
cti can help your purple team exercises

145
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,960
so i'm just going to rattle off the

146
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
definition really quick from the purple

147
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,720
team exercise framework

148
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,039
that purple team exercises according to

149
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,160
this framework are

150
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,680
cyber threat intelligence led emulating

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,479
tactics

152
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,759
techniques and procedures or ttps

153
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
leveraged by known malicious actors

154
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,960
actively targeting the organization

155
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
to identify and remediate gaps in the

156
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,840
organization's security posture

157
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
purple team exercise framework uses the

158
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
following frameworks models and

159
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,800
processes so it uses miter attack

160
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
it uses eric van buggen out's

161
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
threat intel process and of course the

162
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,319
pyramid of pain

163
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,039
i also recommend including the diamond

164
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:51,520
model

165
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,160
and the adversary detection pipeline

166
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,880
model

167
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,599
to help build out the threat

168
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,120
intelligence products that

169
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,840
feed the purple team exercises

170
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,479
so what are some goals of the purple

171
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,319
team exercise framework

172
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,599
well one is to test attack chains

173
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,319
against

174
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,000
a target organization another is to

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,160
train the organization's defenders or

176
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
blue team

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
another is to test the ttps that have

178
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,319
not been tested before in the

179
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,680
organization

180
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,960
another is to test the processes between

181
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,800
security teams another is preparation

182
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,120
for

183
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,240
zero knowledge red team engagements and

184
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,639
then

185
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,599
there's of course a red team reveal or

186
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,639
replay

187
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,639
after the zero knowledge red team

188
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,840
engagement

189
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,879
uh and and most importantly to foster a

190
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,479
collaborative culture within the

191
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,479
security organization

192
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,039
so basically the purple team exercise

193
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,800
framework provides

194
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,680
a framework for improvement of the

195
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,960
security teams

196
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,319
processes uh detection response and

197
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,240
visibility of the organization

198
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,960
so eric van buggen out of invisio

199
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,520
the course author of purple team courses

200
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
at sands institute so he

201
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
he helped create sec 599 and sec

202
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
699 shared his threat intel process for

203
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
purple

204
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,280
so the ptf ptef otherwise known as

205
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
purple team exercise framework

206
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,320
suggests using eric's threat intel

207
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,200
process

208
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,760
so we will use that to go through

209
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
examples with a little bit of

210
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,640
glow-in-the-dark cti sprinkled

211
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,519
throughout by me

212
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,320
i'm going to show you uh with some

213
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,680
practical examples

214
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,480
of how to incorporate cti cyber threat

215
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,760
intelligence

216
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,240
into the purple team exercise framework

217
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,279
i'm going to

218
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,320
provide a few different use cases so

219
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,279
you can tailor the ideas and suggestions

220
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,680
for

221
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,959
your organization so let me take you

222
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,599
dancing

223
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,720
first we are starting with understanding

224
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
the target org as part of eric's threat

225
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,760
intel process

226
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,560
we want to understand what is going on

227
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
with the business

228
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,880
uh other security teams and what goals

229
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,760
we need to hit

230
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,959
as the cti team so for the business

231
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,880
i usually recommend looking at the

232
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,399
management discussion

233
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,959
for the 10k 10q and if you don't have

234
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,760
that

235
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,480
basically the annual report or whatever

236
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
goals report you have

237
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,800
and for this department and security

238
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,680
team

239
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
i really recommend having conversations

240
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
with them and finding out what they

241
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,399
liked

242
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
they didn't like uh regarding your

243
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,600
previous thread intel products

244
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,680
and a lot of times these teams will have

245
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,079
goals like annual goals or quarterly

246
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,680
goals that they have to meet

247
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,399
so as a cti analyst i would want to talk

248
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
with them and find out what they are

249
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,040
so that i can build out products to help

250
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,600
them

251
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,560
do their jobs better so essentially the

252
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,200
cti initiatives can help create

253
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,079
your threat landscape baseline and the

254
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:20,959
purpose

255
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,480
of the cti initiative is to

256
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,880
create a threat landscape specific to

257
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,839
the org

258
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,519
that you track over time so you can spot

259
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,480
anomalies

260
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
it's also to prioritize organization

261
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,399
threats

262
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,120
and to build out deliverables for other

263
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
teams

264
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,399
so now that we have a good idea of what

265
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,680
is going on

266
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,320
in the business and with other teams

267
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
let's look

268
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,040
at the operational environment

269
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,040
so scott j roberts in cti squad goal

270
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
setting requirements

271
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,839
and brian p kyme in threat intelligence

272
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,760
planning and direction

273
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
they have some suggestions as far as how

274
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:06,959
to understand

275
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,000
your operational environment better

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
so for instance review your industry

277
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,440
verticals

278
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
review thread actors and historical

279
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,360
attacks not only against

280
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,720
your orb but also against your vertical

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
uh you want to assess your internal and

282
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,240
external exposure so how do you do that

283
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,200
i suggest running attack scenarios and

284
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
understand the attack progression

285
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
go from external to internal and then

286
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,120
internal to external and really

287
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,480
understand what's going on

288
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,440
so between understanding the business

289
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
needs and concerns

290
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,600
and being familiar with the operational

291
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,560
environment

292
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,519
this lays a really good framework uh

293
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,680
groundwork excuse me for being able to

294
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,040
prioritize

295
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,079
ttps for the purple team exercise

296
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,959
so we're going to use three three

297
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,000
different ways to identify an adversary

298
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,079
through the adversary detection pipeline

299
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,120
model

300
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,279
so the adversary detection pipeline

301
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,279
model refers to

302
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,560
the analysis of organization specific

303
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,200
threats

304
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,519
via structured and unstructured formats

305
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,839
for an adversary detection pipeline

306
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,920
focused on business

307
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,680
departmental and cti initiatives

308
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,800
so first we'll look at email attack data

309
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,920
and then we will look at the use of

310
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,560
public threat actor reports and open

311
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,040
source

312
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,519
intelligence that is specific to your

313
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,880
orgs threat landscape

314
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,920
and then third we're going to look at

315
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
an incident that your org had

316
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,279
so using email attack data you have a

317
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
source of data that can give you

318
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,120
info on some not all of the

319
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,279
various ransomware variants sent to your

320
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,480
org

321
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,959
malware phishing campaigns business

322
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,839
email comp

323
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,200
compromise pec and other attacks

324
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,800
so through looking at all of the email

325
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,040
data including the blocked

326
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,600
you can gain a better understanding of

327
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,079
the type of ttps that are being used

328
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,440
against your org

329
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
prior to the post-exploitation phase

330
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
so when you incorporate the assumed

331
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,880
breach

332
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,079
model in conjunction with looking at the

333
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,800
ttps of the email attack data

334
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,839
you can get involved in proactive

335
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,519
security practices

336
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,160
through ensuring you have visibility

337
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,120
detection

338
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,639
and security controls

339
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,480
the diamond model is great it can help

340
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,639
you structure your pivoting

341
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,279
it can also be used to make activity

342
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,160
groups

343
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,560
so you gotta get kind of creative when

344
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,160
you use the diamond model

345
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
and you have to use it in a way that

346
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,079
works for your organization

347
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,399
so we will start with using the diamond

348
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,079
model with your email data

349
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,560
both blocked and delivered of course to

350
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,760
get a baseline

351
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
on your organization specific threat

352
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
landscape

353
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,440
so if you see the repetitive use

354
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,040
of the infrastructure and capability

355
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,839
vertices

356
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,920
of the diamond model in your email

357
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
attack data

358
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,320
you can group those attacks together as

359
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,079
a threat activity group

360
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
and name them something that's an easier

361
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,560
way to convey data such as

362
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,839
acid burn or fuzzy snuggly duck

363
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,800
so this table here it shows you the

364
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,680
blocked

365
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,360
delivered and clicked malicious emails

366
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,160
this can be used to prioritize purple

367
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,079
team exercises such as

368
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,760
looking at the ttps associated with the

369
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,240
clicked

370
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,440
or delivered campaigns first you can

371
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,160
take it a step further and prioritize

372
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,639
looking at actors that show a high click

373
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,440
rate

374
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,040
of delivered messages i mean what sets

375
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,519
that

376
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,079
activity group apart from the others so

377
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:22,560
just

378
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,959
asking yourself really good questions

379
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,239
when you look at the data

380
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,880
so this thread actor heat map it's just

381
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,160
a fancy way

382
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
of grouping a bunch of attacks based on

383
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,839
the diamond model

384
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,759
then instead of listing out the

385
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,399
infrastructure and capabilities

386
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,320
of the attack in a really really long

387
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,240
sentence you give it a name

388
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,399
the names represent various activity

389
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,959
groups specific to your org

390
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,920
so for purple team exercises you can use

391
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,680
the thread actor heat maps

392
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,880
to see the activity and prioritize

393
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,199
purple team operations based upon

394
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,199
delivery or clicked messages

395
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,839
and the associated ttps this is just

396
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,399
another

397
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,199
visual representation of the table if

398
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,720
you don't like numbers

399
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,519
uh then you can use this and use colors

400
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:11,920
so

401
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,519
whatever whatever you like

402
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,399
you can also use the miter attack

403
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,360
navigator

404
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,160
to view all the ttps for your thread

405
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
activity groups to help you prioritize

406
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,480
your purple team exercises

407
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,920
so purple team exercises don't

408
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,880
have to be about only emulating the

409
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,720
behaviors of attacks

410
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,759
in a specific sequence you can use the

411
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,839
miter attack sub techniques to

412
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,440
consecutively test how your org responds

413
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
starting with the technique that

414
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,880
overlaps the most

415
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,839
based upon your internal attack traffic

416
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,000
so you can notice different people teams

417
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,279
departments

418
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,839
being attacked via the email data you

419
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:02,720
are tracking

420
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,640
as part of the adversary detection

421
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,319
pipeline model

422
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,919
if you are aware of the ttps or commands

423
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,439
of the various malware you could suggest

424
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,319
a purple team exercise based upon that

425
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,679
specific threat

426
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,480
so this can help feed purple team

427
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,359
exercises

428
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,160
based upon business and security

429
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,199
initiatives

430
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
you determined in the threat until

431
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,240
process of

432
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,360
understanding your org

433
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,000
you can create thread actor dossiers

434
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,799
based upon

435
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,280
email attack data these are really

436
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,919
helpful for purple team exercises

437
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,720
so in the thread actor dossier you want

438
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,600
to include

439
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,400
a high level overview of the thread

440
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,679
activity group

441
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,400
then you want to include a heat map of

442
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,080
the thread activity group

443
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
and finally you want to include the set

444
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,160
of ttps with

445
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,400
very specific procedures vary

446
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,840
the ttps you gather based upon your

447
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,039
internal email attack data can also

448
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,280
be used to make recommendations to your

449
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,960
blue team to block

450
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,919
or mitigate before the purple team

451
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,640
exercise

452
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,400
next we have public reported threat

453
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,360
actors

454
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,400
so great resources are of course public

455
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
threat actor reports and white

456
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,280
papers some blogs are really great

457
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,640
any commands and scripts that i find in

458
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,880
public threat intel reports that could

459
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,000
be used

460
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,240
for adversary emulation i've been

461
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,120
calling those

462
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,520
indicators of the emulation they're

463
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,160
different than indicators of compromise

464
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
because the indicators of emulation i i

465
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,919
can actually give to

466
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,640
red team or whomever to perform the

467
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,280
actions

468
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,400
to actually do the exercise um

469
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,440
i recommend focusing on reports that

470
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,640
have indicators of emulation in addition

471
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,000
to the high level ttps uh

472
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,600
those are kind of hard to find but when

473
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,080
you find them stick with that like

474
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,440
uh make a note of it i found a few

475
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,520
really good fire eye blogs

476
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,240
that provide a lot of detail for purple

477
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,440
team exercises

478
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
so when looking at publicly available

479
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,160
threat reports

480
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,960
you want to look for everything that's

481
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,520
related to the pyramid of pain

482
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,360
you might need to pivot off of hash

483
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
values domains

484
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,440
ip addresses and pretty much anything

485
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,160
else

486
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,640
to get to the ttps for the purple team

487
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
exercise

488
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,240
so you can use the pyramid of pain as a

489
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,799
guide

490
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,039
when reviewing and collecting data from

491
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,760
publicly available threat reports

492
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,120
so we'll talk more about extracting ttps

493
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,160
in a bit

494
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,000
and it is important to find good

495
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
reporting sources like i said previously

496
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
for the command line powershell and

497
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,600
any scripts used

498
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,320
as you continue your research you will

499
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,559
need to prioritize the various thread

500
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,559
actors and threats you find

501
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,919
that you think could impact your org

502
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,000
usually when sorting through various

503
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,679
threats you can think about the

504
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,400
attacker's

505
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,720
intent opportunity um and capability

506
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,320
so also as a little aside some

507
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,400
some rabbit holes if you want to go down

508
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
them david j bianco

509
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,039
and cat self and their talk at the sands

510
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,559
threat hunting and ir europe summit 2020

511
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,240
shared a method of prioritizing hunting

512
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
using polar geometry so you can modify

513
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,720
uh the technique and all the stuff that

514
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,360
they did

515
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,880
for their hunt activities and

516
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
prioritizing that and create

517
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,280
a prioritized workflow with polar

518
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,320
geometry

519
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,760
for cti as well

520
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
so how do you know which thread actor to

521
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,960
pick

522
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,000
there's tons uh so

523
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,320
personally i i would recommend starting

524
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,919
with thread actors that target your

525
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,039
vertical

526
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,320
and you can kick it up another notch by

527
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,360
now not only matching your vertical but

528
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,320
also technology targeted so i'm going to

529
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,360
give you an example

530
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
uh crowdstrike they recently released a

531
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,159
report on pioneer kitten

532
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,600
an iran-based adversary that likes to

533
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,600
exploit remote external services vpns

534
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,039
and network appliances so

535
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,000
look at the targeted technology to see

536
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,480
if you

537
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,760
have it and if you do and you're

538
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,039
in the list of targeted industries then

539
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,679
i would consider adding that threat

540
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,240
actor

541
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,280
to the list to include in purple team

542
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
exercises

543
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,080
i know this is an oversimplification but

544
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,520
if this is all you got

545
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
you can start with what you have and

546
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,880
what you know

547
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,760
you can also find a really good lineup

548
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,000
to

549
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
pick from regarding threat actors on

550
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,039
size

551
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,520
community threats and i'll share more

552
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,480
about this

553
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,000
as we get to the creating a plan

554
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,960
in the thread intel process

555
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,840
you can also identify incident data that

556
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,679
you want to get better at detecting

557
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,159
or gain better visibility on

558
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,720
you can run exercises based upon

559
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,840
whatever

560
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,240
works for your org and the resources

561
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,039
available

562
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,400
so for instance i ran into someone from

563
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,679
a small

564
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,960
security team at a sans summit they were

565
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,159
just implementing a sim uh

566
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,919
so something that collects the logs

567
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,360
right uh

568
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,960
so i asked if they had an internal team

569
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,159
or how they use intel and they said that

570
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,360
they were too busy

571
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,679
and short-staffed to even approach the

572
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,559
use

573
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,360
of cti cyber threat intelligence let

574
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,280
alone anything purple

575
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,720
so this got me thinking of how

576
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,600
i could help smaller teams benefit from

577
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,200
cti and purple team exercises

578
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,080
some might not even have the bandwidth

579
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,200
to tackle

580
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,480
the email data as one suggestion

581
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,000
orgs in similar situations could use the

582
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,760
atomic red team tests

583
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,120
and the c2 matrix to see what they can

584
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,159
detect

585
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,960
i mean i was able to set up the atomic

586
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,320
red team

587
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,960
in a really really short amount of time

588
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,600
so

589
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,120
that's something to consider

590
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,919
so now we're going to gather some threat

591
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,720
intelligence

592
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,760
so when you're gathering the threat

593
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,120
intelligence whether you

594
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,159
use email attack data publicly

595
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,039
available threat reports or an incident

596
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,039
specific to your org for the purple team

597
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,320
exercise

598
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,200
you will need to perform research most

599
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,559
likely

600
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,320
in a 2019 cti survey rebecca brown

601
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,760
and robert m lee share some suggested

602
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,679
data collection sources

603
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,400
so of course uh internal tickets waf

604
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,360
email analysis

605
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,640
endpoint ids so

606
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,799
open source intelligence you can i've

607
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,840
already mentioned

608
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,559
white papers threat reports uh threat

609
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,480
researchers are another really good

610
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,279
resource

611
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,400
anything in the news doj indictments

612
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,360
uh sharing groups so if you're a member

613
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,960
of an isac

614
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,440
any certs anything the search released

615
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,159
from different

616
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,320
uh countries tlp amber

617
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,200
and tlp red private intel groups and

618
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,320
then threat feeds

619
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,440
and intel vendors

620
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,159
so for instance the email attack data

621
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:06,799
whatever

622
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,000
campaign you pick to emulate you will

623
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,159
need to perform some research on what

624
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,200
clues you can find that may have been

625
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,320
shared publicly

626
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,840
or you could pivot through some

627
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,400
sandboxes or even looking up reports

628
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,360
related

629
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,400
to the malware or techniques

630
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,880
for public threat actor reporting you

631
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,640
are going to need to look at the white

632
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
papers threat reports security

633
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,720
researchers doj indictments sharing

634
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,880
groups

635
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,960
and anything your threat intel vendors

636
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,159
may or may not have and then for

637
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,039
specific uh for instance specific to

638
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,919
your org

639
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,640
you will still need to be able to search

640
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,760
in sharing groups

641
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,400
isacs certs uh pivoting through

642
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
sandboxes

643
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,840
security researcher publications and

644
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,720
more

645
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,919
of course this list is not exhaustive

646
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,919
but hopefully it gives you some ideas

647
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,720
mitre attack offers a training resource

adam pennington

650
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,679
i recommend checking it out also

651
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,679
as a little side note if you're going to

652
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,760
use the publicly available threat actor

653
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,440
reports and plans

654
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,559
adam pennington at his defcon 28 red

655
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,000
team village talk called

656
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,880
emulating an adversary with imperfect

657
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
intelligence

658
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,400
he talks about the various dependencies

659
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,120
for the

660
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,919
techniques and helpful tips on building

661
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,559
out an adversary emulation plan

662
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,039
based on open source reporting that you

663
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,159
can use for the

664
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,600
purple team exercises and

665
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,000
as you get further into this getting

666
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
better at malware analysis and

667
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,320
understanding what it is that you're

668
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,480
looking at is really helpful

669
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,679
so coleman kane a phd candidate and a

670
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,000
senior cyber threat intelligence

671
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,440
research analyst

672
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,679
has some really great malware analysis

673
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,039
materials

674
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,320
and then also monappa ka an information

675
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,640
security investigator at cisco

676
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,120
has a really great book called learning

677
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,840
malware

678
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,960
analysis where he uses

679
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,520
memory forensics techniques to analyze

680
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,240
malware samples to extract behaviors

681
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,720
i highly recommend it's a good book

682
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,679
also remember we are extracting the ttps

683
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,399
to provide

684
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,760
value to the org so that your security

685
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,159
team

686
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,120
can look at the controls the detection

687
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,240
and the response

688
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,640
for all the stages of the attack path of

689
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,240
your org

690
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,960
for the purposes of this talk i will

691
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,679
show you

692
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,559
an example of looking at an org specific

693
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,679
campaign

694
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,880
the techniques and process i i'm going

695
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,520
to share

696
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,559
could be used for the

697
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,279
email attack data the publicly reported

698
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:05,679
threat

699
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,799
actors and for incident data and

700
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,919
caveat uh just i thought i'd add this in

701
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:12,480
there

702
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,520
with incident specific please practice

703
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,880
good opsec

704
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,960
and i will leave that to your discretion

705
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
and won't get in a long conversation

706
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
about that

707
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,159
so here's the scenario

708
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,240
okay so in the business's annual report

709
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,039
x team is leading a program to form

710
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,039
partnerships for a new incentives

711
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,880
program

712
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,440
that is revenue generating for the

713
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,919
organization

714
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,880
keeping an eye on the department you

715
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,000
notice a campaign that's being sent

716
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,240
specifically

717
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,799
to those people associated with the

718
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,080
project

719
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,760
purple has an exercise coming up and you

720
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,159
know how important it is to the org

721
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,480
to support the revenue generating

722
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,399
incentives program

723
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,440
so why not create a purple team

724
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,799
exercise out of it

725
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,320
so we're gonna use the miter attack

726
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
tactics to guide research

727
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,520
and extraction of the ttps so the

728
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,640
process i use

729
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,840
i look at joe sandbox miter attack

730
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,120
section

731
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,720
and then from the joe sandbox specific

732
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,919
entry in the report i check the atomic

733
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:30,640
red team

734
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,720
for the technique then i look at the

735
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,360
yaml contents to see if it fits my use

736
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,240
case

737
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,880
and then whatever isn't there i google

738
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,679
i've also

739
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,480
pivoted uh through multiple sandboxes so

740
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:42,960
not just

741
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,399
joe sandbox to get additional uh ttps

742
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,520
related to

743
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,799
uh the the campaign so for the purposes

744
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,000
of this talk i

745
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,320
am going to provide highlights because

746
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,039
it's a

747
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,760
it's a little bit of a long process of

748
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,880
extracting the

749
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,600
ttps

750
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,200
so for initial access the campaign that

751
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,120
we're looking at was an email with an xe

752
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,399
attachment

753
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,200
so whether an organization blocks exe

754
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,240
attachments or not

755
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,880
what i'm interested in are the behaviors

756
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,640
of these campaigns

757
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,200
since they are targeting people involved

758
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,080
in a new

759
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,640
revenue generating business initiative

760
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,360
that

761
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,399
is why we are taking an assumed breach

762
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,879
approach

763
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,840
execution so when you look at the

764
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,640
specific

765
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,000
section of the malware report do your

766
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,760
best to get the commands

767
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,720
that can help adversary emulation

768
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,840
so for t1047 i couldn't find the atomic

769
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,279
red team test that fit

770
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,080
my use case so then i had to do some

771
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,960
googling

772
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
and i found something on stack overflow

773
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,000
it wasn't until later like a lot later

774
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,799
in the ttp extraction process that i

775
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,799
just happened to find

776
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,399
uh a technique in the uh atomic red team

777
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,120
that fit

778
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
my use case but it was under a different

779
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,559
technique name

780
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,039
so keep that in mind as you're going

781
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,840
through this process

782
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,080
privilege escalation so once again

783
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,679
getting command line arguments

784
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,519
are important and here's a good reason

785
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,000
why

786
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,440
so for this one i went to malware bazaar

787
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,480
and i looked up the sample and uh

788
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,399
this particular command line argument is

789
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,480
basically where they store

790
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,559
a lot of the like stolen creds that

791
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,159
they're getting and passwords and all of

792
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,039
that

793
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,640
and i wanted to see what yara rules were

794
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,120
associated with it and what i found

795
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,240
was a yard rule from 2015 and it was

796
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,559
still

797
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,799
catching samples off the command line

798
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,399
argument

799
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,799
so what does this tell me this tells me

800
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,919
that i need to

801
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,080
include it in my report since it has

802
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,120
remained the same

803
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,640
since 2015 maybe longer um

804
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,279
i mean it might change tomorrow but for

805
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:11,760
now

806
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,840
it hasn't so it's important

807
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,480
there was a lot of defense evasion with

808
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,840
this report

809
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,279
and as you're looking through the the

810
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,720
malware and ttp extraction

811
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,120
and behaviors uh you also want to

812
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,799
include things that are useful for

813
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,918
defenders as well

814
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
so for credential access they're trying

815
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,399
to get credentials from browsers

816
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,120
and there is an atomic red team for that

817
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,320
collection

818
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,519
they are trying to get the

819
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,440
installed mail clients info and

820
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
passwords

821
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,880
there's an atomic red team for that and

822
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,200
then at command and control

823
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,080
um when you look at command and control

824
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,840
you want to get the different ttps

825
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
associated with that and then

826
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,799
you can go to the c2 matrix and they

827
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,799
basically have a lot of the stuff laid

828
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,480
out so you can kind of look at what you

829
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,200
need

830
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,519
and then just follow the chart and then

831
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,960
pick what you need

832
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,039
and the wonderful thing about the c2

833
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,320
matrix is that it has its own vm

834
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,120
so bam like something really easy you

835
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,559
don't have to install

836
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,559
all of these tools and all this stuff

837
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,399
just use the vm

838
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,600
make your life easier

839
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,320
so for exfiltration this is a really

840
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,519
good place to consider

841
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,399
how your org handles encrypted xfill as

842
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:34,799
well

843
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,919
as to understand how your org handles

844
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,760
exfil just in general

845
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,840
whether it's encrypted or not uh

846
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,880
sometimes you get

847
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,679
lucky and companies will share how the

848
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,960
expel happened

849
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,919
uh during a data breach so knowing what

850
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,279
you do at your org

851
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,320
can help you gauge where you're at also

852
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,880
uh just a little side note i recommend

853
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,519
not

854
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,559
do not uh do not use

855
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,440
real pii and credit card data for exfil

856
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,360
testing and exercises

857
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,120
i know that seems common sense but i

858
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,040
just had to add that in there just in

859
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,079
case

860
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,159
so it doesn't seem to have any

861
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,679
destruction involved

862
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,599
with the impact in this campaign they're

863
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,760
just like no ransomware

864
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,119
it's just stealing creds

865
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,679
so once you extract the ttps you need to

866
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,280
analyze and organize the information

867
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,199
and part of the purple team exercise

868
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,199
framework provides a template to collect

869
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,839
the ttp

870
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,000
information it also provides suggestions

871
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
on working with other teams to decide

872
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,719
which ttp's to actually test

873
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,399
in the purple team exercise

874
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,320
so once the ttps are decided upon

875
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,440
teams can work together to create a plan

876
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,280
if you are using a publicly available

877
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,520
reporting or threat actors any of that

878
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,599
here's some places where you can get a

879
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,240
plan

880
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
already built out for you so save

881
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,480
yourself some headache

882
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,720
so the scythe community threats github

883
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,359
they have apt-19

884
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,280
apt-33 chimera cozy bear

885
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,240
deep panda uh they also have emo tech

886
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,200
evil corp

887
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,000
orange warm and ransomware and i think a

888
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,119
few others

889
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,520
there's the mordor project i already

890
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,599
mentioned the atomic red team

891
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,160
uh uh mitre attack actually has

892
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,839
adversary emulation plans for

893
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,240
apt-3 and apt-29

894
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,839
and then there's other open source

895
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,480
reporting such as ransomware infections

896
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,119
so for emulate the adversary this is

897
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,079
where cti

898
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,680
moves their action items to emulation

899
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,839
of the adversary to wait for the rest of

900
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,320
the phases of the purple team exercise

901
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,680
to complete so

902
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,000
when you go back to the purple team

903
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,079
exercise framework where the other team

904
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,240
members finish the preparation for the

905
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,920
purple team exercise

906
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,119
and actually complete the exercise ct

907
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,839
analysts

908
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,320
can a cti analyst can attend the

909
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,480
exercise as a spectator they don't have

910
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,280
to though

911
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,599
it's completely up to them management

912
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,119
all of that

913
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,359
also too the cti manager in the org

914
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,960
decides if they want

915
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,400
cyber threat intelligence to introduce

916
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,560
the threat actors ttps during

917
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,720
an actual purple team exercise meeting

918
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,000
and kick off

919
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,880
so that's kind of org specific you don't

920
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,160
have to do it

921
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,280
sometimes red or other teams purple

922
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,880
coordinator does it uh so the lessons

923
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,359
learned

924
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,000
phase of purple is where cti analysts

925
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,800
can learn

926
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,920
even more about the org and take these

927
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,839
insights back to the products they

928
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,960
create for other teams

929
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,599
so now we're at the after party so

930
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,440
through this exercise you saw a

931
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,800
practical example

932
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,200
of how cti can be used to purple team

933
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,880
exercises

934
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
you were able to determine that the

935
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,119
attacker is looking for browser

936
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,359
and email passwords for the key people

937
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,119
in your org that are involved with the

938
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,880
new revenue generating business

939
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,480
initiative

940
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,560
so through the purple team exercise you

941
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,599
can find out how

942
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,160
easy it could be to get the passwords

943
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,359
from those particular

944
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,480
users and that part of your network and

945
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
uh the purple team exercise can also

946
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,400
help you look at your org's visibility

947
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,200
controls detection and response

948
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,760
also consider if there's a site

949
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,680
associated with the initiative that you

950
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,079
can access off network uh

951
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,839
if so is 2fa enabled good questions to

952
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,800
ask just ask yourself a lot of questions

953
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,680
so you were able to support business

954
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,720
initiatives

955
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,599
and security team initiatives through

956
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,480
understanding

957
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,040
your internal uh attack landscape

958
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,160
through the cti initiatives essentially

959
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,599
the org uh does not need to get to full

960
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,040
post exploitation activities for cti

961
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,839
analysts to get value out of the ttps

962
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,960
that the attackers share

963
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,160
so roberto rodriguez a principal threat

964
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,240
researcher at microsoft

965
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,800
also known as cyberward dog on twitter

966
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,400
he has a great resource

967
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,040
on using excel for the miter attack heat

968
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,920
map

969
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,119
uh it's tracking tracking hunt team

970
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,240
and how hot your hunt team is so you can

971
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,440
do the same for purple adversary

972
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
emulation

973
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,960
where you use the miter attack name

974
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,480
navigator to

975
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,119
track progress and create metrics for

976
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,640
senior management

977
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,839
so here's an example of how you could

978
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,400
use the miter attack navigator

979
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
and ttp is to create metrics and track

980
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,119
progress

981
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,680
so these are the behaviors of the

982
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,079
attacks coming at the organization

983
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,720
we have x percent coverage with our

984
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,160
controls

985
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,280
x percent detection and we are in the

986
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,920
process

987
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,200
of addressing x gaps through x y and

988
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
z actions so this provides

989
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,359
a meaningful and org specific metrics

990
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,640
and shows

991
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,960
due diligence to your shareholders

992
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,640
investors management

993
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,680
as well as a justification for any

994
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,839
security products you have

995
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,960
and also too uh it's it's colorful

996
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,640
so you can just show the colors kind of

997
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
like a flip-fold calendar

998
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,680
it's fun so

999
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,480
now we're at the after after party after

1000
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,079
the after party

1001
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,800
so how can we keep the party going uh

1002
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,760
commit to

1003
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,359
intelligence driven purple team

1004
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,040
exercises

1005
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,160
use models frameworks processes to

1006
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,400
make your life easier like the miter

1007
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,280
attack

1008
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,520
the diamond model the c2 matrix the

1009
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,720
pyramid of pain

1010
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,880
the purple team exercise framework yar

1011
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,040
rules eric bond bug and outs

1012
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
threat intel process and of course the

1013
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,359
adversary detection pipeline model

1014
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,079
i'm going to ask you to please talk with

1015
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,040
your cti

1016
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,720
team and tell them what you need uh most

1017
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,280
people aren't psychic and they can't

1018
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,720
read your mind

1019
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,880
so talk with them just have

1020
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,240
conversations

1021
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,119
i i promise uh i don't bite at least i

1022
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:25,680
don't i

1023
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,240
i'm fairly certain other cti analysts

1024
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,599
don't either

1025
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,240
also get a copy of the purple team

1026
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,680
exercise framework

1027
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,920
you can find that on psy's website and

1028
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,960
also too

1029
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,040
um there's a link to it in the github

1030
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,960
repo and i'll show you the link again

1031
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,560
