1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,320
okay

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
so hello everyone and thanks for

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,239
attending to this talk

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,000
before my presentation i would like to

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,760
say like a big thanks

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,840
to the staff of this confidence online

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,039
editions

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,359
everybody knows that this year was very

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,439
difficult for almost everyone

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,840
and i hope that everything is okay for

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,200
you and your relatives in this days

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,760
so here we are i'm felix emmy i'm with

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,480
my guest star

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
event that you don't see him on the

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,719
screen

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,559
we are french we are a member of the

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,160
great team in kaspersky

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,160
it's furious now and we concentrate

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,760
ourselves

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
mostly to track and investigate on cyber

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,960
crime

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
and iept straight actors and uh

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,079
in this context one of my first research

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,680
was to to find new we not innovative

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,399
ways

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,879
to do infrastructure investigations and

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,640
our talk today is about that

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,920
and in particular the way that we found

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,479
open source implant situ on the internet

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,680
and how we correlate

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,360
them in kaspersky today and just to to

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,240
know that

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,720
this talk is an updated version of what

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,080
we've presented

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,520
in sas 2019 with new heuristics

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,880
and examples

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,040
so this talk

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
talks about implants and tools that are

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,119
available of the shelf which means that

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,000
in the extreme

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
majority they are open source such as

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,119
for example

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,520
empire or meteor predator and so on uh

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,000
but also some commercial ones such as

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,439
like cobalt strike

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,600
which are used today by malicious threat

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,560
actors

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,000
and you have a little list

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,320
which is non-exhaustive on the right um

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,719
and they are used by the straight actors

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
and not only like by

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,799
red teams or for this famous disclaimer

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,598
for educational purpose only

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
another interesting point with those

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,920
like implants is that they are developed

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,680
in high-level languages

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
such as pitom powershell or almost

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,599
even go which employs that they are

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,319
dependent

60
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,400
of different libraries even on their

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
server side and most of them communicate

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,440
with default

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,000
uh standard port so in conclusion not

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
for this talk but just for this slide

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,599
there's two words i need by and for

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,239
returmers but apt group have also found

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,440
a good reason

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,160
to use them

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,959
so the first reason is that they are

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
community powered

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,640
this project are maintained by a huge

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,480
number of volunteers

73
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
which means a workforce that is bigger

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,599
than more

75
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
more experiences than most of the player

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:56,959
can

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
ever even hope for and

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
one of the best advantages to use this

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,319
tool is that

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,800
they are cost effective you are like

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
less r d no more development for the

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,920
attackers

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,800
and everything is available for free and

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,760
updated

85
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,720
with the last like returning techniques

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
and the third advantage

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,480
that any attacker can see is that they

88
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,080
are less discriminant

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
as everyone is using this framework it's

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,239
not possible to correlate

91
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,879
attack best on the tool set alone on the

92
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,920
malware

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,959
careful attackers are always happy

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,080
to vanish in the ambient noise so

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
less discriminates that's some people's

96
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,799
are thinking is it really the case

97
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,480
is it really the hand of straight

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
intelligence as we know hit

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,319
and for us in great uh we saw hit

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,080
uh we saw that a few years ago it was an

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,319
opportunity

102
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,439
so let me explain that uh with

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,879
uh with this very small diamond model

104
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,400
and kill chain

105
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,439
uh the result like you have used changes

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,319
and they reside

107
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,519
mainly in the capabilities uh sections

108
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,319
and weaponization sections but the world

109
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:14,959
pictures

110
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,880
remain the same the wall intros and set

111
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,199
pictures remain the same

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,839
so you can like employ all old

113
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,440
correlation tricked by

114
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
based for example on action and

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,479
objective or

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,520
iocs or anything to correlate

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
these guys even if they are using open

118
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
source tools

119
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,000
but like my talk will not be uh on that

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,520
but it will be only like

121
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,560
on infrastructure stuff

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,880
so why to look at infrastructure in that

123
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
talk

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,800
we we investigate on infrastructure

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,160
first to follow and anticipate attacks

126
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,800
because you know that attackers needs to

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,440
set up

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,759
prior and attack their infrastructure so

129
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,120
it's always good

130
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,520
to have the infrastructure all of the

131
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,360
domain ips everything

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,199
uh before that the attacks happens to

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,840
block them for their consumers

134
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,320
moreover by illuminating an

135
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
infrastructure crystals

136
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
thanks to for example specific heuristic

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,360
discovered

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
it allows you to go and to get new ioc

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,560
easily

140
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,759
and not only share with your partners

141
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
the ioc that you have seen on a specific

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,440
case

143
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
sometimes also entrusion set can set up

144
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:30,880
their

145
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,840
own situ to accept different type of

146
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,639
implants

147
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,960
some of open source ones and other

148
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
completely homemade

149
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,600
so you have like one malicious situ and

150
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,840
you can see thanks to your telemetry of

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
public services

152
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
with a new tool that which connects to

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,039
it and try

154
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,440
to get a known implant it was the case

155
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,720
for example

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,759
a few few months ago with the poetry

157
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,880
c2 that was disclosed by by talos

158
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,520
the same c2 was used by the same actor

159
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,319
as for example a meta operator and a

160
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,560
ppc2 which is an uh patent-based implant

161
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
and the last interesting thing

162
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,479
with infrastructure investigation is to

163
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,360
do like

164
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
some epic technology as you may know

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,639
some attackers are

166
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
like typical squatting some legit domain

167
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,400
on off their

168
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,199
target and it's still interesting to see

169
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,520
uh

170
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,560
there's like people sweating um but

171
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,919
like i've seen that most of the time uh

172
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,880
don this done by like u.s threat teams

173
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,280
and it was like a good way to know

174
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,560
their customers list

175
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,919
so we have seen some advantages

176
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,199
to discover and to look at the

177
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
infrastructure about how to discover

178
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,160
it so in the next slide you will see

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,960
like common

180
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,280
anomaly and mistake that you can see on

181
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,560
open source c2 but

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,840
also on like a very private

183
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,560
tool c2

184
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,639
so let's go uh the first one and uh like

185
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,000
most famous one

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,720
uh the most famous mistake in the

187
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,520
community

188
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,080
is regarding the certificates sometimes

189
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,360
they are present directly in the

190
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,039
repository of the tools

191
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,680
and they remain unchanged when the guy

192
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,720
deploy is

193
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,360
like c2 on the server and other time

194
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
they are generated during the

195
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
installation of the c2 but

196
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,160
with all coded strings so there is

197
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,759
always a good way to find

198
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,960
situs with dems and so you have on that

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,319
slide few examples

200
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,840
uh like for cobalt strike pp empire

201
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,800
everything

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
on like open source project and you can

203
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,280
see at the top of the slide the list of

204
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,080
the tools which is non-executive

205
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,919
of like tools that are like vulnerable

206
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
to that

207
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,440
so moreover like this this issue is not

208
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,840
only on the listeners but it's called it

209
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,039
can be also on the

210
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,840
admin port admin panel of this tools for

211
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,280
example you have some

212
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
default certificate for meta spot

213
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,039
framework

214
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,599
web interface or for example for the

215
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,360
team server or coupled strike

216
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,599
and so you just have to scan internet on

217
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,120
like the specific sport

218
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,080
and look at for like the certificate to

219
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,479
to grab some ctus

220
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,560
uh the second uh the the second scene

221
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,840
that we see it's default and hard-coded

222
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,879
artifacts for example

223
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,479
you can see on that slide that you have

224
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,880
many different hard-coded stuff

225
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
for example for fishery which is

226
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,279
something to steal

227
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,479
ntlm ashes

228
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,279
you you can see on the basic

229
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,560
authentication some

230
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,959
secure document gateway string that is

231
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,240
only for that

232
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,440
you have also some r-coded dats so uh

233
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,640
no we are not uh on wednesday uh in

234
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,160
september 2012.

235
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,320
uh so if you scan internet and look at

236
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
that you can like

237
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,360
i i don't see this on my slide but

238
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
i think it was a responder a responder

239
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,360
server

240
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,640
and so on and you can see that many

241
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,360
many stuff are completely uh hardcoded

242
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,399
so it's very

243
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,519
easy by using for example show them so

244
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,240
nim for

245
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,959
any like internet scanning engine to

246
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,920
discover

247
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
this kind of c2 and to track them

248
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
automatically

249
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,760
another scene which i love is

250
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,399
developers aaron and fabes so you have a

251
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,360
lot of them

252
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,000
uh you have like the infamous hidden

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,279
space

254
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
that have been seen uh that we track

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,720
like since 2017 or something like that

256
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,160
on uh cobalt strike https you have to

257
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,480
know

258
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,880
that even if it have been corrected it's

259
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
very easy today to track

260
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,279
a cobalt strike c2 you have also some

261
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,320
kinds of no-line breaks on some web page

262
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,839
and it was the case also on uh

263
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
the fake ees page of

264
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,440
empire just because the developers have

265
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,680
copy pasted the html code

266
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,279
and the tabs were converted to space

267
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,000
and which was good is that almost like

268
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,279
one month ago

269
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,720
i've seen this uh the this request

270
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
just to adjust http listeners of the new

271
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680
version of global strike

272
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,680
so please uh let's uh let copies

273
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,880
like it's on uh yes and

274
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,120
they have done the same mistake again so

275
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,000
they have like

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
good tabs uh for their like in the css

277
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
for the body and container

278
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,480
stuff but for like images they have

279
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,040
still

280
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,560
uh led space so they they did

281
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
the same error again and like the sha

282
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
one or the the

283
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
one or the md5 of this of this page like

284
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,680
is completely different of the legit one

285
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,839
another another very interesting thing

286
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,560
uh is that all of the decoy web server

287
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
the main problem is that uh they buzz uh

288
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,320
their

289
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
web server on specific library and when

290
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,720
they try when the attackers or the

291
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
developers try to mimic a web server

292
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
most of the time it doesn't match uh the

293
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,079
real one

294
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,240
it doesn't match the real one by the

295
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,360
signature or

296
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,480
even like the order of the

297
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,399
http uh header so you can easily

298
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,440
bust some stuff like that so when you

299
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,519
are in front of a server which tries for

300
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,000
example

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,839
to mimic uh which writes to mimic

302
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,560
an nginx or an fhe server you have to

303
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,639
look like for example directly id

304
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,600
order of the headers in the answer and

305
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,839
you will see that in most of the time

306
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,480
they don't match at the legit one it's

307
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,399
it's very difficult to match the legit

308
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,920
one because this server

309
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,279
are best unlike specific uh libraries

310
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,920
for example

311
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,200
flask or tornado or anything and they

312
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,160
can't uh

313
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,639
move uh the other uh from a place to

314
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,560
another with this library

315
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,279
so uh i don't know uh many internet

316
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,279
scanning that are like putting the

317
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,839
header

318
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,560
at the like the the order of this header

319
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,839
in their response but you have onymf

320
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,040
which is an european one that does it

321
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,279
pretty well and allows you to track

322
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,000
many many implants thanks to that

323
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,360
uh the last uh scene uh

324
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,959
is some uh protocol issue uh

325
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,560
it's not the last scene uh uh the first

326
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,839
uh interesting thing uh that i've

327
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,480
encouraged uh was from

328
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,279
a meterpreter that employs always the

329
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:55,920
same

330
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,399
diffie element prime so you can also

331
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,079
derivate it

332
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,279
for example in a theory catarrhal

333
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
and when it initiates https connection

334
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,320
and i found the same

335
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,839
quite recently with

336
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,880
ssf servers

337
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,600
which were used on a case by midi water

338
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
architects

339
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,120
during like direction and objective to

340
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,720
to nail something

341
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,480
and they this uh this kind of tools

342
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,800
has have also is uh

343
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,560
is on a prime number

344
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,200
for like default configuration and you

345
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,880
can see also some protocol

346
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,000
anomalies another famous one is with

347
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
cobalt strike

348
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,880
when you uh you ask for a cobalt strike

349
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,399
c2 via dns

350
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,160
some txt record and then it enter

351
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
like um a record so it's quite

352
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,720
interesting

353
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,519
here also you can scan internet to to

354
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,880
find some command strike

355
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,839
servers

356
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,920
and let's finish by the last since

357
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,519
is like malware in answers so

358
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,120
for example you have my interpreter

359
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
listener can have some of them

360
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,399
in in their answer just by searching

361
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,079
for example default pdos headers

362
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,800
by using for example shodan you can get

363
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
many meta operators c2 events if they

364
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,120
are

365
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,240
like some fault positive to checks but

366
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,360
most of them are

367
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,560
like meta-operator ctos and we have seen

368
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,079
that also with puppy

369
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,560
and sometimes with construct and it's

370
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,440
something to not

371
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,839
but on specific urls

372
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,880
so now that we have seen how to hand for

373
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,920
c2 let's see

374
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,040
how to create them

375
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,959
thank you so basically uh the question

376
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,519
is here

377
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,360
what are we hunting for and the threat

378
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,560
intelligence community has

379
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
a tendency to focus purely on technical

380
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,839
aspects

381
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,079
well because obviously this is uh what

382
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,600
is most obvious to us

383
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,839
but the thing is it should not be

384
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,440
forgotten that

385
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
however sophisticated campaigns can get

386
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
they are still operated by humans

387
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,800
and most of the actors that

388
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,639
we've seen are not hacking computers for

389
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,680
the sake of it

390
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
whether they are financially motivated

391
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
or

392
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,759
apd actors conducting espionage they

393
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,440
have strong incentives to be as

394
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
efficient as possible uh

395
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
at their job and so smaller groups are

396
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,199
going to want to reduce their overhead

397
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,560
as much as possible

398
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,320
because they want to focus their limited

399
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,399
resources on whatever maximizes their

400
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,160
expected profits

401
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
but large groups possibly composed of

402
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,000
different teams and or interchangeable

403
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,800
people

404
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,880
are difficult to coordinate unless they

405
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,839
establish reproducible processes

406
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,920
i do not imagine that such organizations

407
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
are run differently than large software

408
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,320
companies

409
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
so the idea here is that if alice calls

410
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,680
in sick

411
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,720
then bob must be able to take over

412
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
and this in turn implies that there are

413
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,839
uh single documented ways to do things

414
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,399
and a great example of this is a

415
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,519
document that was leaked

416
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,320
uh by um wikileaks in a big league

417
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
called bowl seven

418
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,199
and the document was called development

419
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,120
tradecraft do's and don'ts

420
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,279
uh in which i'll describe the standard

421
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
guidelines for how to write software

422
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,040
used in operations

423
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,120
uh once they have been leaked or

424
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,199
reconstructed by security analysts

425
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,120
these guidelines become a sort of

426
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
signature or maybe even a matrix that

427
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,680
can be used for attribution purposes

428
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,079
and while we do not have examples of

429
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,399
such documents for an attacker

430
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,480
building infrastructure i'm willing to

431
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
bet that one exists somewhere i mean

432
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,279
isn't that obvious it looks like a

433
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,600
boring job with a lot of boxes to check

434
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,360
like reliability of the provider

435
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,279
responses to abuse requests anonymous

436
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,160
payments

437
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,279
etc and so taking some time to think

438
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,800
about these constraints

439
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,079
can help the hunting efforts

440
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,400
significantly so an example of such a

441
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,599
pattern would be

442
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,919
buying multiple servers in the same as

443
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,280
the provider for

444
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
the email address used to create the

445
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,480
account

446
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,599
the configuration being deployed exactly

447
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,000
the same

448
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,599
because of the proving engineering

449
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,520
scripts like ansible

450
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,480
or stuff like this and so as established

451
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,079
in the previous slide

452
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,880
attackers they have strong incentives to

453
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,799
automate c2 setup through provisioning

454
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,160
scripts because

455
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,280
this is going to make their uh efforts

456
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,320
reproducible

457
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,640
uh even if they have to change employees

458
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,080
or replace people

459
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,559
uh but those scripts of course might set

460
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,080
up servers in a way that are going to

461
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,840
make them very unique

462
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,280
so how we are looking for when we try to

463
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,160
do some infrastructure clusterization

464
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,960
first

465
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,799
we will look at the ostriches because

466
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,240
they don't change

467
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,520
like for each campaign for each attack

468
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
every registrars and no stores

469
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,559
everything

470
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,559
so we are looking for obviously

471
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,679
autonomous system

472
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,120
and ip ranges because they they register

473
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,720
like some vps by cluster so sometimes

474
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
most of the c2 are in the same app

475
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,000
ranges

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,480
you you have to look also on dns records

477
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
associated to the domains

478
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,240
for example the name server of course

479
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,960
but also the the txt record or

480
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,760
state of authority or any like dns

481
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,480
record that

482
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,000
can uh can allows you to grab some info

483
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,919
uh on the context moreover you have to

484
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,640
to look at the domain pattern

485
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,400
where like strings in domains or the

486
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,559
kind of domains that is pointing on the

487
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,400
ip address it can be like

488
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,160
a dynamic dns domain or like a glue dns

489
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,679
or something like that

490
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,320
and moreover the last things is to look

491
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,400
at like setup states

492
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
why just because you have uh sometimes

493
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,400
uh the attackers

494
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,440
like register their infrastructure

495
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,000
on the same day and they wait after like

496
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,120
for one month they

497
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,520
they use it for one month and they they

498
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,760
use another batch of infrastructure for

499
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
the next campaign so

500
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,360
setup dates are quite interesting also

501
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,879
for like crossterization

502
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,320
and how about the config uh so what we

503
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,440
are looking for

504
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,600
we are looking for support status on the

505
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,160
c2 for example if the port is closed

506
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,679
opens filtered everything of course also

507
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,520
the services

508
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
where the where they are listening on

509
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,720
and

510
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,120
for for example there are version two

511
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
the operating systems

512
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,320
uh some hints and we will see that later

513
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,720
of port forwarding it can be for example

514
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
e-tags it can be uh

515
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,160
even the window size the size of the the

516
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
the volume the the tcp protocols

517
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,799
sometimes you have the window side that

518
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,640
change from a port to another on the

519
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,120
same orb and it can be a hint of part

520
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,880
forwarding

521
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,559
and you have also some protocols

522
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,159
answered that are very

523
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,440
very interesting to look on so

524
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,320
how to create uh how together

525
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,679
in in grades uh i have created

526
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,159
uh a private tool during the summer that

527
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,039
uh i'm named

528
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,919
uh infragene it's a kind of funny

529
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,559
because it's

530
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,000
like egen and jade kaspersky

531
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
i'm the only one to to to smile at at

532
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,080
that joke

533
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,919
uh but um it's uh it has been developed

534
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,280
uh to uh to the for entering to the

535
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
needs of infrastructure clustering of

536
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,559
the team

537
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,600
and uh if we show it today it's not like

538
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,640
to release it

539
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,880
uh but to present some examples of

540
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,799
infrastructure correlation

541
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,480
uh bust of on-the-shelf implant c2 and

542
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,120
like some ergonomic tricks that can be

543
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,080
used

544
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,600
for this kind of correlations

545
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,919
so uh let's start with a small example

546
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,200
uh a recent one a recent what

547
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,280
it was like one year ago when i i was

548
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,320
investigating

549
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,320
on the rio crystal and it was like

550
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,960
how to burn a real cobalt strike

551
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
infrastructure just in three clicks

552
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,200
so here you you have the

553
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,000
you have a paper a technical paper by

554
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,960
vmware

555
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,640
carbon black and this won't present a

556
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,799
kind of incidence response based on

557
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,919
real case uh with some reversing

558
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,159
analysis of the red somewhere itself and

559
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,000
in the ioc section you have like

560
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,880
domain names let's copy past it in

561
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,799
androgen

562
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,200
so it takes some times

563
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
to see the scan report of development

564
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
and

565
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,440
to do as you can see uh it's a cobalt

566
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,039
strike c2 which used

567
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,240
glue dns records it's the c

568
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,360
g dns tags so let's correlate it i want

569
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,960
all of the cobalt strike in the same

570
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
autonomous system which are using

571
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,919
a good dns records and like let's

572
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,960
encrypt certificates

573
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
let's wait few seconds because like my

574
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
server is completely crappy

575
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,280
and boom boom

576
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,559
yes sorry i'm very i have a

577
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,360
shitty server

578
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,840
i'm gonna have to accelerate the video

579
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,280
maybe

580
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,600
and tada we have all of the the cobalt

581
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
strike that have like the same

582
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,919
configuration

583
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,919
and associated to this dns stress actor

584
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,400
maybe

585
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,080
not the first one but most of the

586
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,120
of most of them are associated to

587
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,239
this uh like real cluster

588
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,080
so the next one uh it's like an apt

589
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,120
uh example uh it's an apt that i

590
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,159
uh temporarily called dropy because it's

591
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,320
used like dropbox

592
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,600
to to to drop some metapreterm during

593
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,039
their operation

594
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,520
and i call this type of factor like the

595
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,640
missing

596
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,880
apt straight actor just because they use

597
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,360
only red teaming techniques

598
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
and implants to compromise like for

599
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,840
example governmental networks

600
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,200
or international entities so like nobody

601
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,320
is looking at them

602
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,000
even if it works and

603
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,039
since they never get closer based on

604
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,120
their tools no real name is given to

605
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
them

606
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,559
so let's look at hits we have uh

607
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,400
so sorry we have on that slide so a

608
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,360
small review of two scan of the same

609
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,240
server which is a simple meta operator

610
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,440
stager so

611
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,559
let's go to one of the scans and

612
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,039
you will see if you are like very

613
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:15,840
careful

614
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,440
that the server answer

615
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,960
an apg-2 ubuntu generic

616
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,559
page but in each http editor you can see

617
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:26,799
an

618
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,200
nginx one so it can be a hint for

619
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,600
example of port forwarding

620
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,840
and it's like very discriminant with

621
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,279
such kind of stuff

622
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,600
on for example met operator server so

623
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,400
let's

624
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,120
let's look at it by selecting just the

625
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,080
body

626
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,840
and the http header value

627
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,480
and of course that we want metasploit

628
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,039
stager

629
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,919
up i switch to block and here we are

630
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,440
we have like a lot of their

631
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,120
infrastructure that have been already

632
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,000
scanned because

633
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
it was like meteor predator stages

634
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,520
so in order to handle

635
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,600
all of the stuff i've created like you

636
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,080
know environment severe eye application

637
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,960
is great the first one is a kind of

638
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,080
crown

639
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
which requests like different kind of

640
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,600
aps it can be like

641
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,559
completely homemade aps or from public

642
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,440
services

643
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,320
in order to to do some heuristics rules

644
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,400
to track automatically the

645
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,159
infrastructures

646
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,360
it can be uh or it can be for moves of

647
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,840
some of them or implants everything and

648
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,480
each

649
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,600
update are resized to the analyst by an

650
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,440
encrypted emails and

651
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,679
all of the hob that have been discovered

652
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,320
are automatically tagged

653
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,520
in or by cdns database and of course

654
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
this new ap

655
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,159
this new server are directly scanned

656
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,679
by infogen for like future creation

657
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,960
so in conclusion

658
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,320
our first conclusions will be like

659
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,400
who is correlation is dead but like

660
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,440
don't worry

661
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,360
we are in 2020. it means that okay

662
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,880
gdpr is here now but you can't

663
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,320
really only on contextual stuff such as

664
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
whois and attackers know and they are

665
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,559
very careful about

666
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,679
it now anyway name server or registrar

667
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,799
to create

668
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,279
the infrastructure you have new methods

669
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,080
that exist

670
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,559
and they have been proved as you have

671
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,720
seen on the battlefield

672
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,880
of course all of this type of c2

673
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,120
anomalies and correlation methods can be

674
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,600
still used by many apt infrastructure

675
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,400
clusters

676
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,200
and a small portion of them i will not

677
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,320
see it but

678
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,440
i think that it's uh it's uh

679
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,799
it's uh you you see it on the right

680
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,559
uh and like you can you can use it for

681
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,000
a different apt and you have a list of

682
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,559
on the right a few of them and you have

683
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,159
like bentley or other

684
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,640
that are like vulnerable to this kind of

685
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,240
creation

686
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,279
um uh

687
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,600
why like still be used just because

688
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,320
some apt have started to mutate by using

689
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,039
for example

690
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,480
new c2 methods new c2 protocol or

691
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,799
like tcp level whitelisting domain

692
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,760
fronting

693
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,520
and even sigins and if they are the best

694
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
of the bench or like the helith one

695
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,159
uh they can rely on sigins not only to

696
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:40,880
do like

697
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,559
reconnaissance phases prior and

698
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,880
intrusion but also to communicate with

699
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,760
their implants

700
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,799
for example it's the case with turla and

701
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,679
we we think that other of them are using

702
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,120
c games actively

703
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,640
during their operation and of course

704
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,440
by using sigins like this elite actor

705
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,320
can also do

706
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,640
some money on the side attacks along

707
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
them to interact

708
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,039
uh with some malware already present and

709
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,600
implanted on the targeted networks

710
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,159
and as of today we have some suspicion

711
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,399
maybe it will be the

712
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,360
a new new conference topic but we have

713
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
some suspicions

714
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,760
of such behavior which seems to have

715
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,640
been used

716
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,279
where some implants seems to have been

717
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:25,760
used

718
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,720
to deploy so some more sophisticated

719
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,279
implants

720
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,679
in the targeted networks but that's

721
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,799
another story for

722
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,919
like another conference

723
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,840
so okay this is the end of the

724
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,080
conference

725
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,559
if you have any questions just feel free

726
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,240
to ask them

727
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,120
uh no or after by email or twitter i

728
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,080
think that we have

729
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,640
on twitter there by using private

730
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,279
message

731
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,520
uh if you want some rules i can also

732
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,720
provide them

733
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,960
and thanks a lot thanks for like the

734
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
state uh the stafford this conference

735
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,399
and we we're gonna give the mic to them

736
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:13,840
thank you
