1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,000
okay

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,160
thank you for attending my my talk about

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,839
mozilla identification

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,039
and access management systems the

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,279
name of the talk was chosen by a friend

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,960
of mine who was like hey

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,439
you don't have access to mozilla anymore

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,560
access denied for you

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
me how well done so i tried to log in

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
uh a week or two weeks after i was

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
uh after i left the company

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,480
apparently someone correctly locked my

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,600
account which is awesome

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,559
so the question why why do we even need

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,520
a custom

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,960
identification and uh

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
authorization system well problem is

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,680
nothing is obvious in an environment

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,719
like mozilla

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
mozilla's boundaries are very unclear

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
and there is a lot of people working

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,440
together that

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,720
are not part of the organization

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
itself so for example

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,760
there is a huge community around mozilla

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,720
estimated to be like 5 000 people that's

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,790
what i heard

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,200
[Music]

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
and many of these community people they

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,799
work together

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,520
with a staff staff being people employed

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,400
by mozilla

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,920
and getting salaries and we are

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,720
or we were a very unusual company

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
because mozilla shares system outside of

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,479
the organization

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
so if there is internal slack in some

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,320
bank

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,640
that's the internal slack of this bank

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,600
for mozilla

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,439
there are private channels public

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,720
channels

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,320
everything is shared between community

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,240
and employees this is a challenging

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
environment

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,360
with a need to co-manage identities of

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,640
people from all around the world

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,639
so at some point people started asking

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,399
questions how do we unify

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,480
a couple hundreds of systems that we

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,760
have at mozilla uses

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,560
and how to do a unified authentication

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,200
with an

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,560
unknown number of licenses you know it

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
when you are trying to buy

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,840
licenses for some some products

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,200
it's like hey how many licenses would

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,239
you like to buy

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,440
and mozilla would be like 1200

60
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,640
but we might need 5 000 tomorrow but we

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,319
might need 700.

62
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,000
we need maybe 10 000 a year from now

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
but for a month and we do not really

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,319
have enough money to pay for 10

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,760
000 so this kind of licensing

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,400
issues give a lot of headache to every

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,040
single vendor

68
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,920
and vendors were trying to come up with

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,879
solutions

70
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,000
dynamic licensing maybe if your

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,440
community member has not been active for

72
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,680
a while we will revoke the license

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,480
but we didn't want to so basically the

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,680
problem was

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,800
we cannot buy there is no way mozilla

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,440
can buy

77
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,920
a license for everything we use for

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,599
every community member

79
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,120
there's just not enough financial

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,959
resources as you might heard recently

81
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,159
so the project was born

82
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,519
and a very important part it was not me

83
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
like i did nothing in this project i

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,720
just thought

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,959
a couple of weeks ago when i was looking

86
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,840
for something

87
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,519
interesting to present at confidence

88
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,519
but hey this identification management

89
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,799
system is

90
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
one of the successful projects maybe

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,200
that's because i was not part of the

92
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,280
project

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
so i took something from my colleagues

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,599
and there they are

95
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,519
uh three most important people on the

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,720
screen and

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
tens of others who helped i was not part

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
of it i did nothing

99
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
literally i'm just as someone said

100
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,160
i'm an ex-engineer with a stockholm

101
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,440
syndrome

102
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
i'm not work longer work there but i

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
talk about it

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,520
so what do i mean by

105
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,600
we need to give a lot of musicians

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,680
access to mozilla systems

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
as you can see on a diagram

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,080
mozilla staff which is employees are

109
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,120
just a subset of what we call

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
mozillians where mozillians who are

111
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,720
volunteers

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,520
helping develop firefox you can do it on

113
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,160
the site

114
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,960
you can write add-ons you can help

115
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,639
writing the

116
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,440
mozilla developer network documentation

117
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,479
or

118
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,759
work on the last language or well

119
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,560
as recently as a separate organization

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,440
but still

121
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,680
and there's like tens of projects inside

122
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,479
of mozilla anyone from outside can help

123
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,720
and if you want to help you need access

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
to our internal systems to

125
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
communicate with other volunteers to

126
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
communicate with staff

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,759
so the idea was to design a very unified

128
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,560
identity system for whatever kind of

129
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
mozillian you are

130
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,919
so muslians both from the community and

131
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,360
corporation can access any system they

132
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
need to

133
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,720
so diagram time let's spend half an hour

134
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
talking about diagram

135
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,600
just kidding but something important to

136
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,080
show here

137
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,960
on the left you can see what kind of

138
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,039
people we are thinking about getting

139
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,800
access to mozilla systems

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,199
so that's volunteers community verse

141
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:57,840
staff

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,440
like i said on the right you have like

143
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,759
the

144
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,840
mozilla login web page which is our

145
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,080
sso web panel this is what you get when

146
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,199
you go to like sso.mozilla.com

147
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
if you feel like fantastic something you

148
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,759
know there is back bounty program

149
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,000
so you already know the address just

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
saying

151
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,680
and it is like a startup portal

152
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
that verifies your identity this portal

153
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,919
talks to our

154
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
identity provider and also of zero

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
we use multiple authentic identity

156
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
providers i will show it

157
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,520
in a second and we store

158
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,800
information about who has access to what

159
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
kind of systems

160
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
is something we call mozillians this is

161
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,199
the square

162
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,440
but i'm trying to circle with my mouse i

163
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
hope that's visible

164
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
the mozilla's ones is like a database of

165
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
all users both community and staff

166
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,199
and there is also some corporation

167
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,639
information uh

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,440
for employment for employers ingested

169
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,199
from work day

170
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,599
all of these sources of information all

171
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,840
of these sources of true

172
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,759
go into something that we call change

173
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,280
integration service

174
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,560
which is a service running in aws

175
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,160
using probably most of aws technologies

176
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,039
known to the world

177
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,759
it ingests a number of information

178
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,599
from about groups who belongs where

179
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,599
who has access to what what the

180
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,960
permissions look like

181
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,639
it talks to our open ldap for

182
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,000
authentication

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,680
and for storing passwords uh

184
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,199
it it parses the well

185
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,199
it sends every user session for of zero

186
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,039
which is like a rule engine that i will

187
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
talk about in a second

188
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
and after all of these steps are done

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
you can get access to one of our

190
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,759
shark systems that we share with the

191
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,080
world

192
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,520
so the goal was here like you saw this

193
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,560
diagram

194
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,520
and i talked a lot and you are like what

195
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,280
this is confusing

196
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,000
uh it's confusing and it's powerful uh

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the goal here was to lower the barrier

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,520
to participate

199
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,039
while enforcing access to sensitive

200
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,319
systems so what do i mean by that lower

201
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,080
barrier to participate

202
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
as you will see in a second you on you

203
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,839
can see on the screen here

204
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,159
you can log into many mozilla systems

205
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,080
not just an employee with your held up

206
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200
password

207
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
but with your firefox account github

208
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,279
google whatever

209
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,200
but we still want to maintain control

210
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
over your identity and access to our

211
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
systems

212
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,959
so what we did is in a traditional

213
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,800
system

214
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,160
you would have a various login methods

215
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,880
uh well you would have one like one idp

216
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,080
what is idp

217
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,720
identification provider which is the

218
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
glorified database really

219
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,720
that stores all of the information about

220
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,880
passwords and usernames nothing

221
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,080
complicated about it

222
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,959
and we have ours as well we store our

223
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,720
user names and passwords for

224
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,880
staff and stuff only in ldap

225
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,279
but people from the community were like

226
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,279
i don't feel like creating another

227
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,560
account with mozilla

228
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,279
just for you i want to log in with my

229
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,080
existing

230
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,600
uh gmail account okay or i want to log

231
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
in with my github account

232
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,160
okay or i want to log in with firefox

233
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,800
accounts

234
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,040
like it does make sense i have a firefox

235
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,920
account

236
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
i use it for synchronizing data between

237
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,200
my browsers

238
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,160
i want to use it to participate in the

239
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,279
mozilla community

240
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,480
absolutely so

241
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,200
we have multiple identity identification

242
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
providers

243
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,560
identity providers as you can see on the

244
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
left

245
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,560
and we divide them who is it for so

246
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,440
ldap only keeps information about staff

247
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
which are mozilla employees

248
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,959
everything else is for community and

249
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,880
community can choose one of these

250
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
identities on the left here

251
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,120
now all of these come

252
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,680
with very various security levels and we

253
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,160
want to

254
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,200
enforce minimal security level to access

255
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,920
our systems so we require that those

256
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,600
login methods on the left

257
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,160
have some minimal security levels on the

258
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,640
right

259
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,680
like support for mfa

260
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,279
so we only accept your google or which

261
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,360
is the gmail login if you have a

262
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,880
mfi enabled same for github if you don't

263
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,360
have mfi enabled in your github account

264
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,000
you will not

265
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,240
be able to use it to access mozilla's

266
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,760
mozilla modular systems

267
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,160
the passwordless option is interesting

268
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,160
you can log in just with provided by

269
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
providing your email address never

270
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
create any special account never

271
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,279
remember any password

272
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,040
and when you want to log in you provide

273
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
the email address again

274
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,440
and it sends a link to your email that

275
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,480
you click

276
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,040
and you log in so it's like using i

277
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,560
forgot my password

278
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,880
every single time it's for the least

279
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
secure systems but we don't really care

280
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
much about

281
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,000
tldr you can login into multiple mozilla

282
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,959
systems

283
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,720
with many different uh identification

284
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,680
machines that you have

285
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,240
now we want a system that will be

286
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
flexible but we want a system that also

287
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
enforces some minimal

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,200
minimal security level right it is not

289
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
that we want to give access to everyone

290
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
who has any random gmail address

291
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,920
and give them access to whatever mozilla

292
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,680
systems they signed up for

293
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,480
we want to assert some sort of trust so

294
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,399
we invented this concept well

295
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,839
we didn't really invent it but we

296
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,079
enforced this concept kind of like you

297
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,680
must be distal to right

298
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,240
like if you go with your kids to some um

299
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,720
playground and there are like various

300
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,639
activities available and your kid is

301
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,160
like 10 years old

302
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,800
and some of them are only available if

303
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,320
the kid is like

304
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,200
this tall enough or like as 12 years old

305
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,320
otherwise

306
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,839
there is a risk to this kid the kid

307
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,839
cannot ride kind of similar situation

308
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,320
here

309
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,639
we enforce some minimal requirements on

310
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,519
the

311
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,639
authentication and let me show you how

312
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,839
it's done

313
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,160
so for every identification provider

314
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,880
we kind of collect something that we

315
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,120
call assurance levels and we enforce

316
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,560
assurance level

317
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,040
so what is an uh so when you are trying

318
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
to log into

319
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,639
uh when you are trying in the ideal

320
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,440
world

321
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,279
when you are trying to log into mozilla

322
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,959
system

323
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,040
with your laptop which is on the right

324
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
side on the

325
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,160
at the top of the diagram

326
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,200
there would be like a agent running on

327
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,399
your system

328
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,160
that would be asking hey does this

329
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,079
person where is trying to log into our

330
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,279
systems

331
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,760
uh does this system have this encryption

332
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,480
enabled

333
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,200
is the system up to date so asking

334
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,440
questions for example about the

335
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,639
machine itself device we call it device

336
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,120
a

337
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,279
uh a i so like updated encrypted

338
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,519
do we know this device from previous

339
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,519
sessions

340
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,800
on the other hand our system asks some

341
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,079
questions about the user itself

342
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,160
so for example is the user trying to log

343
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,440
in with identification method

344
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,639
that supports mfa

345
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,920
is the geolocation node what is the

346
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,040
geolocation like

347
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,480
maybe it changed between

348
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,000
between user sessions those

349
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,880
indicators as we call them assurance

350
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,639
access indicators

351
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,120
are combined into something that we call

352
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,199
assurance level

353
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,320
and this assurance level is a minimal

354
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,800
bar

355
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
that you have to pass if you want to log

356
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,399
into a mozilla system so let me give you

357
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
an example

358
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,320
you are trying to log into our chat

359
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,480
website like this course

360
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,399
so when you are trying to log into this

361
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,720
course if you just want to chat

362
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
on this course we will require that both

363
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,399
your machine

364
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,680
and your your sales session meets the

365
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,600
low assurance level low being like

366
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,639
you have an account have a nice day

367
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,519
and but it only gives you access to chat

368
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,639
on the website

369
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,920
but if you want to be like an

370
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,240
administrator you want to be an

371
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
administrator wrong uh we will require

372
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
the high assurance level to access the

373
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
administrative panel of the same chat

374
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,560
website

375
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,639
so we will require that you log in with

376
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,680
mfa

377
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,199
from a non-geolocation with a decent

378
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,399
unknown updated encrypted whatever

379
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,680
device so system like this allows us to

380
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,480
enforce a minimal level of security

381
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,839
to access various systems

382
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,399
uh you can see an example you can go to

383
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,639
this link even if you want to look at it

384
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,480
how those various indicators are mapped

385
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,959
into assurance levels

386
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,680
so for the law it's like yeah if there

387
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
was an account and there was no recent

388
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
brute forcing on an account we will let

389
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,639
you in

390
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,000
uh for the medium security level systems

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,920
you also need to meet the requirement

392
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,199
for 2fa and the

393
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,040
idp needs to be high assurance so

394
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
something like github

395
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,140
gmail for the high

396
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,320
[Music]

397
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,759
assurance level we'd rather see

398
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,920
the geolocation not jump all over the

399
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,759
place not jump all over the world

400
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,279
that could be an indicator of a

401
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
compromise like someone logged in

402
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,639
from here san francisco and

403
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,790
five minutes later someone logins from

404
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,199
[Music]

405
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,639
completely different parts of the world

406
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,399
like some somewhere in krakow

407
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,519
and we would think oh this person might

408
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,079
be

409
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,320
not traveling that fast even they use

410
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,360
vpn

411
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
or maybe someone stole their credentials

412
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,839
and is using them from somewhere else

413
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,120
so there is a plot twist there is always

414
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,440
a

415
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,959
plot twist if you are trying to

416
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,239
implement something in mozilla

417
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,600
remember me talking about the user agent

418
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
on your device

419
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
checking the security level on your

420
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
machine so

421
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,440
when we proposed something like this

422
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,240
inside of

423
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,199
mozilla people were like forget about it

424
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:47,839
like

425
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,560
just no way so we were like we'll run

426
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,680
this piece of code

427
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
small demon whatever on everyone's

428
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,120
laptop and people

429
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,519
still tell us the state of your device

430
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,720
and people were like

431
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,480
no you are violating my privacy i'm like

432
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,359
what privacy is there if i'm just asking

433
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
if your device is encrypted

434
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,640
no you are violating my privacy okay

435
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,599
got it got the message so mozilla

436
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,959
internally does not use

437
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,280
any verification of the end user device

438
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
other problems that we encountered were

439
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,559
the geolocation

440
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,919
is super noisy and

441
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,840
it's very difficult to use geolocation

442
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
for any reliable detection

443
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,200
especially in environment like mozilla

444
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,480
where people use a lot of vpns like

445
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,880
vpns are something that like i don't

446
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,120
know 70 percent of people use on a daily

447
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
basis

448
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,640
and so we require mfa that's like our

449
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,480
assurance level

450
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
and if you are looking for an agent that

451
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
would check the state of your device and

452
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
communicate to your ian system

453
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,039
there is one of three for google there

454
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
is a link in the

455
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,880
presentation itself and i will share

456
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
those slides later so you can get all of

457
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,360
those links

458
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,240
coffee time

459
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,840
and a wake-up time if someone is

460
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,879
sleeping already

461
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,000
another feature is multi-step access

462
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
verification

463
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,000
so not only just the identification

464
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,720
provider

465
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,200
decides on access to a system but also

466
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
the rp which is the system that you are

467
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,160
accessing

468
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
can decide as well so

469
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
a very simple diagram really you are

470
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,880
trying to access

471
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,679
let's say our mozded which is our sim

472
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,000
where we keep our logs for security and

473
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
response

474
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,520
the first stage which would be the

475
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,640
sso.mozilla.com with all the complicated

476
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,559
diagram we'll just verify

477
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,120
does the user have an account is mfi

478
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,360
enabled what is the assurance level

479
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,919
what are the generic groups of this user

480
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,760
and the general groups are like

481
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,720
mihawk is in eis enterprise information

482
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,600
security

483
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
we will let him in so this is what the

484
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,039
aussie authentication

485
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,919
access provider decides on then

486
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,280
authentication is

487
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,600
passed on to the rp system which is the

488
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
system that you are trying to access

489
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,080
like

490
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,280
slack discourse most dev and this system

491
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,559
can also

492
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,440
design on its own if it wants to allow

493
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,400
user

494
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
access or what kind of access should be

495
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,280
allowed so on a generic level i might be

496
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,600
at the first step allowed to access most

497
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,520
dev but most dev itself

498
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,160
will decide i only have read-only access

499
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,840
or like access to a subset of data

500
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,259
[Music]

501
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,039
another feature we wanted to

502
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,880
be able to in the process of

503
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,120
authentication and authorization

504
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,679
enforce arbitrary transformation rules

505
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,440
what do i mean by that

506
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,160
uh you remember me talking about how

507
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
zero

508
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
previously of zero is like a giant rule

509
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,840
enzyme it's kind of like octa but not

510
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,960
really

511
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
it allows you to take the user session

512
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,280
the user session has to pass through

513
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,400
zero for of0 to agree on the

514
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,360
authentication

515
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
what you can do is you can rewrite any

516
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,200
part of the authentication flow

517
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
which is very interesting i would

518
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
suggest strongly for you to take a look

519
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,640
at the repository

520
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,880
but i'm linking here what you can do

521
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
with the authentication use when you use

522
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,480
of0

523
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
you can basically take the user session

524
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,039
and write arbitrary code

525
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,039
to act on this session and decide if the

526
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,320
user should be allowed

527
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,559
not allowed you can change the user's

528
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,440
identity

529
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,919
you can change the user's profile

530
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,679
information

531
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,440
and so on and so forth you can basically

532
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,039
do anything that you want

533
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,600
to the user session which is interesting

534
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,120
uh here just a very

535
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,200
simple example of a function that

536
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
decides on whenever someone should

537
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,320
access or not it's like hey give me the

538
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,880
groups

539
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,240
give me user groups and if user is in

540
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,360
those groups

541
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,918
let them in

542
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,320
another feature that we wanted to

543
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
enforce would be automatic access

544
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,520
expiration

545
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,840
so as our director of security likes to

546
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,039
say use it

547
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,840
or lose it so what i mean is

548
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
every time you access any mozilla system

549
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
that

550
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,679
opt in to that time stamping to the

551
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,760
automatic access expiration

552
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,880
uh your access is having

553
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,559
well is being timestamped there is a

554
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,640
database that it stores

555
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
the last time and date when you access

556
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,159
this system

557
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,799
and there is a counter next time you

558
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,080
access this system

559
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,640
uh mozilla i am is like when was the

560
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,200
last time

561
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,919
me how used most death okay me how used

562
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,600
most death a week ago

563
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,760
perfect miho is a regular user of most

564
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,400
deaf but if i stopped using mazda for

565
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
like half a year

566
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,799
uh the system will be like where was the

567
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,520
last time

568
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
we tried to access it and it would be

569
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,640
like

570
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,159
half a year ago we kick

571
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,400
everyone's session when we kill the

572
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,360
account

573
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,919
in most dev uh for everyone who does not

574
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,440
use it on a regular basis

575
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
so this is a very useful feature because

576
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
in an environment where you have like 60

577
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,679
or 100 different systems that you

578
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,000
that you provide access to it's very

579
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,520
difficult to manage

580
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,480
uh the problem hey does this user still

581
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,200
have access do i still need these access

582
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,039
well if i don't use it they don't need

583
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,559
it so it's gonna expire

584
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,480
it's go it goes away it's like a very

585
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,360
clean solution here

586
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,000
another feature is

587
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,080
a bunch of oidc proxies so

588
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,720
we were trying to connect a bunch of

589
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,880
systems that do not speak oidc

590
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,159
which is one of the iem protocols uh

591
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,600
we're trying to connect them to our

592
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,039
system

593
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,360
but some applications do not speak any

594
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,679
either or idc or some

595
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,240
so we were like okay we want our system

596
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,840
to be able to

597
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,159
be fronted with a proxy so you have your

598
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,039
application

599
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,720
in front of your application you put a

600
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,039
proxy that does authentication

601
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,480
and that's how you connect it to the

602
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,400
single sign-on

603
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,200
so there's a bunch of them there is like

604
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,600
this

605
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,320
identity our proxy from google it's free

606
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,120
you can use it

607
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,799
you basically put it in front of your

608
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,880
application and boom your application is

609
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,799
oidc compatible

610
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,159
so if you use gcp

611
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,840
i have no experience with it but i know

612
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,320
it exists so i'm like yeah

613
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,600
there it is there is a similar service

614
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,720
offered by aws and

615
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,279
you have to use aws load balancers but

616
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,000
mozilla would not be mozilla if we

617
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
were not writing something on our own so

618
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
a friend of mine

619
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,320
wrote a

620
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,039
nginx lua open id connect access

621
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,240
proxy that's a log name

622
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,799
and this proxy is basically a modified

623
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,720
version of engine x with like a bunch of

624
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,679
lua scripts

625
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,120
that you can put in front of your

626
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,919
application that is not oidc compatible

627
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:18,799
and now it is

628
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,880
because users will be talking to your

629
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
application for this proxy

630
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,080
it's very simple to deploy it's open

631
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,960
source link is at the

632
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,720
top of the slide just just use it

633
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,760
we used it for well kind of for

634
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,559
providing federated uh connection and

635
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,679
sso to things

636
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,360
like command-line applications for

637
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
example like mozilla uses mercurial

638
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,120
for storing the firefox source code

639
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,679
uh how do you make this one sso

640
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,000
well quite simple there is a modified

641
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
version of the

642
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,520
mercurial client which is a cli client

643
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,720
modified version of a

644
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
cli client and we will not go in any

645
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,919
details

646
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,919
because it's super complicated but

647
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,919
basically whenever you are a human using

648
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,559
hg

649
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,480
use our own modified client that

650
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
talks to your browser opens a browser

651
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,120
window so when a developer wants to push

652
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
something to hd

653
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,559
they start the ag client the client is

654
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,440
like i have no

655
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,080
session active so it opens a browser

656
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,840
window

657
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,640
you authenticate to our ssomozilla.com

658
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,240
all the permission checks take

659
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,440
take place the browser closes returns

660
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
the authentication token

661
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,480
to your cli client the cli client

662
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,919
keeps this token for a couple of hours

663
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,039
you use the hg like normal and

664
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,640
maybe next day you have to relock it

665
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,960
again

666
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,480
similar style with federated ssh also

667
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,520
the same friend of mine

668
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,600
wrote it kind of beyond corp google

669
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,279
style

670
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,000
if you want to ssh into a server this is

671
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
not something that mozilla uses

672
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,320
internally

673
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,159
but this is something that is hey there

674
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,360
is a working piece of code

675
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,360
there is a way using the support that

676
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,240
ssh has natively the support for

677
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,159
authenticating into servers

678
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,600
using the open shca

679
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
with to to connect your servers to

680
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,880
single sign-on so the way it works is

681
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
kind of like this you are trying to ssh

682
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,400
into a server

683
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,440
you usually you do it using an sh access

684
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,919
proxy

685
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,440
and the access proxy

686
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,240
speaks to the mozilla i am the im lets

687
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,720
you in

688
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,200
or not returns the decision to the

689
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,159
access proxy

690
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,799
and what the what the it does under the

691
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,600
hood

692
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,440
is it issues you a temporary

693
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,799
signed by mozilla iim

694
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,799
certificate and using this certificate

695
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,080
you can access the server

696
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,360
the server knows about the same ca so

697
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
can verify that the signature is valid

698
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,600
it's very similar to

699
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,880
authenticating using the

700
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
karabaros for example it kind of gives

701
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,240
you a ticket that you can reuse later

702
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,840
that would be what i have here and i'm

703
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
waiting for the questions

704
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,799
and i'm giving the i'm returning back to

705
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:35,840
the studio

706
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,320
you
