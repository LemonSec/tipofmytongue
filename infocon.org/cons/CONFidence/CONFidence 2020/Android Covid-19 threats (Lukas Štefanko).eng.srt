00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,840
i have been analyzing android apps for

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,599
last seven eight years

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,840
mainly focusing on android malware but

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,279
also android app

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,960
vulnerabilities today i would like to

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
share you the topic of a code 19

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,199
android malware since well last year

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,760
with no one expect such presentation

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,800
being available

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,040
on our confidence but this year

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,160
everything has changed for

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,840
most of us because of the pandemic

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,200
situation

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,760
not only for us but also for the bad

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
guys for the threat actors

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,680
scenes many of them switched from their

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,320
current campaigns to the new ones

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,199

current campaigns to the new ones

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,759
trying to exploit vulnerable

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,240
users on the internet that are searching

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
for the latest news and updates about

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
the victims about

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,159
the infection being spread all around

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,399
the world by distributing your fake

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,200
website

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
and malware such as coronavirus trackers

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
fake symptom identifiers

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
a patch alleged apps created by the

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,240
government or the private sector

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,280
fake government websites and since

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
this is not only about the tracking or

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,280
heat maps with recovery but also staying

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,239
in touch

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,040
with our friends family colleagues

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,000
employees

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
there were also identified malicious

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,200
zoom apps

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,640
actually this is the first time that i

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,520
have seen

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,840
that many different malware types

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,319
impersonating one topic

69
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,840
coronavirus in upcoming slides i will go

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
through a different malware types

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,200
by going to quick analysis

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
their distribution vector and

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,319
functionality examples

74
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,959
i hope this is okay with you with you so

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,360
let's

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
jump into let's start with the android

77
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,959
transformer

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,840
this is a new android ranchmer family

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,319
called

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,400
cry crypter i analyzed that i found that

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,360
two months ago it was available through

82
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,400
or spread through

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,480
through fake website with the same theme

84
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,159
malicious koi19 tracker app algebraic

85
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,959
created by the canadian government

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,879
as you can see there is a huge logo a

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
huge button i get it on play store

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,360
it was not available on play store it is

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,239
interesting

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,120
that this campaign started only a couple

91
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
of days

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,920
when a canadian government said

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
it would back up the development of the

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,519
official legit

95
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,200
coordinating tracing app

96
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,080
with the purpose of this app is a file

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
encrypting ransomware it would

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,879
encrypt all the files on your device and

99
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,000
then left the contact to the editor

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,159
now i'll show you how it looks like once

101
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,760
you download and install

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,400
and launch transfer it would encrypt all

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,239
the files in the background and displays

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,360
a notification

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,599
your personal files were encrypted

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,879
follow c

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,200
read readme underscore now dot txt

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,000
files were encrypted with the or added

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
extension.anc

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,159
it encrypts 15 different file types on

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,760
external media

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,440
using a es algorithm

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
where it would generate a random key for

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,919
each device

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,160
after the encryption it would create the

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,280
text file

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,600
in every directory in subdirectory on

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
external media

119
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,080
which contains information or contacts

120
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,800
information

121
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400
to the attacker i of course didn't

122
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,759
contact the

123
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,479
malware actor but i haven't got the

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,280
reply yet

125
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,600
and it was two months ago during my

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,479
analysis

127
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,520
i find out that there's some cry crypto

128
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
it's actually open source and it's based

129
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
on cry droid

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,080
which was it's not anymore available on

131
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,800
my github

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,919
reported that and it was taken down

133
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,520
i believe not by github but by the

134
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,160
author

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,520
of the repo itself

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,479
when i analyze ransomware or locker on

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,840
android i

138
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,320
always try to think about the ways how

139
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,120
to

140
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,039
retrieve files back to the user or

141
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,800
encrypt them

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,880
in this case i was successful since the

143
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,960
malware contained a vulnerability in

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,000
proper export

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,320
of android component it means that

146
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,120
events were exported to one service

147
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,199
that could be triggered launched by any

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,360
third party installed on a device

149
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,160
and this service is responsible for

150
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,280
encrypting

151
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,039
or decrypting files on a device without

152
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,919
knowing the key

153
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,919
and that's what exactly was exploited

154
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,639
here and of course i created a cry

155
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,960
decrypter tool to help the victims

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,720
i'll show you a quick example how it

157
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,120
looks like

158
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,840
hi there guys in this video i will going

159
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,479
to

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,560
demonstrate the functionality of the new

161
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,840
android ransomware

162
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,440
that was found called cry crypter

163
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,039
in this video i will demonstrate the

164
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,560
functionality

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
i will run it through frida so we can

166
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,960
see which applications or files

167
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,160
are changed by the app and then we will

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,960
decrypt all the files back using our cry

169
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,840
decrypter

170
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,039
to the user for free so

171
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,199
let me launch the the app for the first

172
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,440
time

173
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
using frida

174
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
the request user to access to files of

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
course

176
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
and now it goes through files on

177
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,960
external media

178
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:49,840
and encrypts them using aes

179
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,919
personal files were encrypted

180
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,840
let's see our photos refresh them

181
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,960
and all of them are encrypted using a

182
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,639
nc extension now let's launch are

183
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,919
a cry decrypter

184
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,000
and this cry decrypter will make the app

185
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,280
decrypt files back to to user without

186
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,239
paying a ransom

187
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,080
personal files decrypted refresh

188
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,039
and files are available back again to

189
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,000
the user without

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,440
actually paying a ransom

191
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,840
describe decrypter is available on each

192
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,759
github so feel free to download that

193
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,319
since

194
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,520
if you stumble upon this malware

195
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,599
the threat actor maybe didn't reply to

196
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
you as well so if you have your files

197
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
encrypted feel free to download that and

198
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
use that

199
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
that was android ransomware using code

200
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,879
19 theme now let's move to another

201
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,919
category or malware which is a spyware

202
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,240
i divided that into two categories the

203
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
commercial and

204
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,039
open source so let's start with spinal

205
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,400
as a commercial one

206
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,599
i believe many of you know that uh this

207
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,759
piper family spy note actually it was

208
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,520
leaked the builder of the spy note was

209
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,319
leaked

210
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,400
a couple of years it means that now

211
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
anyone

212
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,280
that has a spy note can create um this

213
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,520
is

214
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
pyro family and distributed them on the

215
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,759
internet without actually knowing how

216
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,240
spyware works android or security of the

217
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,159
systems

218
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,519
and impersonating who similar

219
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,159
commercial spy max allegedly created by

220
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,320
the same author as a spy note

221
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
this one was distributed through fake

222
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,920
website impersonating

223
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,479
pharmacy

224
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,920
open source not that popular ad about

225
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,839
distributed and

226
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,120
middle east since the pandemic started

227
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
there we identified um two new

228
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,120
families one of them is a project spy

229
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,560
this was discovered

230
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,920
or analyzed by a friend micro new mother

231
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
family

232
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,800
even misuses notification access

233
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
still this malware works in the

234
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
background so user actually see

235
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,880
the corner virus updates another one

236
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
identified by by me i call it uzbekistan

237
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,640
spy

238
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,839
since it targets some users people in a

239
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,680
uzbekistan it's buy some

240
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
victims photos text messages contacts

241
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,800
you can

242
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,000
even take pictures and it still

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,240
has the real functionality displaying

244
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,480
the number of cases from all around the

245
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,720
world

246
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,680
not that frequently seen malware

247
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
category

248
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,320
but here it is sms worm was also misused

249
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
in this campaign this was identified by

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
the scalar

251
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,720
fake website and bear in mind

252
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
this was distributed in the beginning of

253
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,320
the pandemic situation in

254
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,600
march i guess where there was a deficit

255
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,160
of um

256
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,959
safety mask so there was a nice camera

257
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,800
download the app to get

258
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
um safety masks however if you download

259
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
the app

260
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
and launch that it would immediately

261
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,839
send a text message to all your contacts

262
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,519
with the predefined text

263
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,480
and the url that either points to the

264
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,360
scam

265
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
or to a malicious app where by

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
downloading and installing that

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,959
you spread the scam further

268
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,920
no two batched apps

269
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,560
most of them i i've seen were

270
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,800
used were patched using a metasploit

271
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
framework many of you i believe know

272
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,760
that

273
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,839
clean app is patched by a couple of

274
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,040
script here and there

275
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,600
here and there using a metasploit code

276
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,640
where it could

277
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
um helps the bad guy create either

278
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
matter better or reverse shelter reverse

279
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,440
shell

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
to connect to infected device left side

281
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,760
is original app

282
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,519
created by either government or personal

283
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,320
sector in italy some code 19 it was an

284
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
app

285
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,120
that could help track the coin 19

286
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,000
positive people

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
and the right side is the malicious one

288
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,200
you can see the difference

289
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,240
between the permissions

290
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
um there's an interesting story covering

291
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
this malware since

292
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,839
it was one of the first patched with the

293
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,079
metasploit

294
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,680
i analyzed that and published quick

295
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,600
analysis on twitter as well as my

296
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,440
fellow researcher nikolaos from avist

297
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,519
and based on that we see that mobile

298
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,720
actors are

299
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,200
following our work scenes as well as

300
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,839
nicos

301
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,000
as well as i mean he was contacted

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,440
algebly

303
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
by the creator of this um of this

304
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,200
malware

305
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,920
and he even calls us mistress his really

306
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,959
gentleman

307
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,560
malware creator

308
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
move forward to every category which is

309
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
typical for uh many different campaigns

310
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,279
including this one and where display

311
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,480
unwanted ads

312
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,519
also hidden at similar to joker

313
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,440
that at that time was responsible for

314
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,600
address techniques clicking on the ads

315
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,519
in the background to generate revenue

316
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,519
for the developer many of them could

317
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,440
even hide itself

318
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,160
from the user view now let's continue

319
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,120
with the most

320
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,519
dangerous category in my opinion which

321
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,399
is

322
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
mobile banking trojans

323
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,519
most of them i will show all of them

324
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,279
i'll show you were distributed through

325
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,120
fake websites impersonating

326
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,279
legit services they were distributed

327
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,800
based on my research three um

328
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,519
most three families seven servers

329
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,320
cannabis

330
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,839
and banking trojan they tried to

331
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,680
impersonate legit services as i said

332
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
w-h-o

333
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,600
with a huge button it's on play store it

334
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,079
wasn't

335
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,680
same in here will represent who download

336
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
our app to see how many

337
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,279
debts were caused by a coronavirus

338
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,000
they even included a biohazard logo

339
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,920
besides those there were

340
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,040
fake websites

341
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,519
that represented the government

342
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,480
compensation

343
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,639
for the financial loss they would give

344
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,399
you 600 euros

345
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,720
if you download the app of course you

346
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,839
wouldn't receive any money

347
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,279
you would end up with a malware

348
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,760
this was widely seen um a theme

349
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,720
in different language mutations um italy

350
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,639
spain uh french

351
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,560
turkey again the same case scenario huge

352
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
button google play store i even prepared

353
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,000
one case example

354
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,519
how it looks like how the infection

355
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,440
looks like from the victim perspective i

356
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,320
will show you

357
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,360

wear a mask if not you can watch the

361
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,760
video but

362
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,440
first you have to download the media

363
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,000
player which is a malware

364
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,240
be part of a solution not part of the

365
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,839
problem

366
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,360
join our research to help fight kobe 19

367
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,279
mostly spread in a united kingdom

368
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,360
fake state support for families

download the app apply in the app and

370
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,720
you would receive

371
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,800
1000 turkish lira which was

372
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,519
approximately

373
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,760
130 euros

374
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,320
same in here play button in the domain

375
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,880
even

376
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,120

fake spain ministry of health social

384
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,600

385
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,040
self-assessment

386
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,320
sales same in here it was a banking

387
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
trojan

388
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
same scam being distributed at thailand

389
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,320
this one is interesting

390
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,160
travel permits document if you want to

391
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
travel abroad you need to visit the

392
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
website download the app and apply

393
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
in our in our app

394
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,079
i even identified the new banking trojan

395
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:30,720
called

396
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,360
now tools which is actually not the new

397
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
since it was based on the anabys

398
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
source code which was leaked and with

399
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,839
2.1

400
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,160
fake website impersonating google play

401
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,920
store and the apps

402
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,800
created by the government to track code

403
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,199
19

404
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
and in here we can see the elementary

405
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,639
mistakes and how

406
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,959
bad guys tried to act really fast really

407
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,040
quickly to distribute the malware

408
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,680
when they even misspelled the kovit for

409
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,199
covin

410
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,680
now i would like to show the example of

411
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,079
infiltration of infection

412
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,959
by the user on the left side you see a

413
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,800
smartphone

414
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
of the victim that's my smartphone on

415
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,079
the right side the burp

416
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,079
it's a proxy to intercept the traffic

417
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,920
communication network communication from

418
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,040
the device to server

419
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,199
and vice versa once you click on the

420
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,240
play store button

421
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,079
it will download the app not from play

422
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,480
store user needs to manually install

423
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
that

424
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,720
and now you can see there's a app named

425
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,440
20 gb

426
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,040
which is a huge red flag but even though

427
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,399
it success 20 gb over 170 people

428
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,360
really installed this this application

429
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,880
once you open that

430
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,959
for most of the times like 99 percent

431
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,800
the banking trojan i just show you

432
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,240
there is a request to activate

433
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,320
accessibility services

434
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
and once this is done malware takes

435
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,079
control over the infected device to

436
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,959
perform

437
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,000
different variations such as clicks now

438
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,040
it by itself deactivates google play

439
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
protect

440
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,759
now indicators information from the

441
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,520
device such as

442
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,760
what kind of device it is where it's um

443
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,640
situated

444
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,559
where apps are installed is there some

445
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,400
targeted like banking app

446
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
financial app and sends the information

447
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
to the cnc server

448
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,160
cnc sends back response to activate all

449
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,439
the necessary permissions

450
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,520
by itself again is using accessibility

451
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
services

452
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,000
send text messages access contacts

453
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,360
access to

454
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,799
external storage and more again tries to

455
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,600
deactivate by itself play protect

456
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
and activates notification access by

457
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,640
doing that

458
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,280
it can bypass sms two-factor

459
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,919
authentication as well as read

460
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,000
notifications coming from your bank and

461
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,960
kill them

462
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,360
in the case well you just send them

463
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,919
100 uh euros to some account this

464
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,679
notification will be immediately killed

465
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,720
by the malware

466
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,160
now the question is how i know that

467
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,799
there were over seven

468
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:03,120
170 infected devices when i

469
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,000
did the analysis of the cnc server it

470
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,600
was um accessible without any

471
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,480
authentication

472
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,799
it means that i found a couple of logs

473
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,160
and this lock or

474
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,280
logs represented 170 devices being

475
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,440
connected to the cnc as a vector devices

476
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,919
now let's move to the last category or

477
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,039
subcategory

478
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,799
which is zoom app as i said to staying

479
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,160
with touch with our people

480
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,960
bad guys again misused this as well this

481
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,840
was by the way

482
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,160
identified by a bit defender

483
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,720
they identified the zoom application

484
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,559
being patched with a metasploit

485
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,840
and injected the code responsible for

486
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,120
um allowing multiplier or regular shell

487
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,799
communication for the bad guy it means

488
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,679
that the

489
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,280
fake zoom app actually worked you can

490
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,120
make calls but in the background

491
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,760
attacker has control over your device

492
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,679
same patch app with the adwords

493
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,360
displaying unwanted ads

494
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,120
as well as some hidden ad which is

495
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,520
responsible for

496
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,799
for a ad frauds means

497
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,400
clicking on ads in the background to

498
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,320
generate revenue for the developer

499
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,640
let's go through a quick recap

500
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,200
this happened really fast and bad guys

501
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,240
acted

502
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,480
really quickly to adapt to switch from

503
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,640
their campaigns to something new

504
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,000
because they knew there's a lot of

505
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,559
vulnerable users uh consider

506
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,760
at the beginning of the pandemic

507
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,919
situation that would like to know

508
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,240
the most the updated information about

509
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
the kobit 19.

510
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
for me it was a cluster of threats that

511
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,840
i haven't seen before

512
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,799
joining into one malware impersonating

513
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,440
one theme

514
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,120
most of them were distributed through

515
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,679
fake websites or text messages

516
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,000
and there was most of them i would say

517
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,679
banking trojan represented by their

518
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,520
servers or anyways

519
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,400
banking trojan

520
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,919
since many of us still work from home

521
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,520
because of the outbreak

522
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,159
i do as well we spend much more time

523
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,600
online cruising the internet

524
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,760
shopping and searching for the latest

525
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,600
updates about carnivalers

526
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,400
and these times we are more vulnerable

527
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,080
don't visit shady website

528
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,240
where we might end up downloading

529
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,280
malicious

530
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,919
and malicious apps impersonating

531
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,440
legitimate services

532
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
as you have seen in a slide before

533
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
people do that

534
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,520
because of that i advise you to download

535
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
apps only from google play store

536
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,520
and if you stay home stay safe

537
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
thank you very much for your time if you

538
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
have any questions feel free to ask

539
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,840
again thank you very much bye

540
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,678
