2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,840
i'm gonna go try and fly through these

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,599
slides because i have a lot to cover i

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,320
got 55 slides in 45 minutes so i'm just

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,440
gonna go ahead and kick it off and get

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,160
started

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,760
uh so i'm going to go ahead and talk to

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,199
you guys about the 419 problems of bec

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
uh and the title of my presentation is

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,599
i've got 419 problems and bec

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,279
isn't just one and i'll be kind of

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,119
walking through a lot of the problems in

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,719
business email compromise a lot of

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,480
problems on the 419 side

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
and kind of walking through with some of

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,920
the actual things that are happening

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,680
and why we need to stop pointing fingers

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,120
back and forth with each other to say oh

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,160
well you need to go

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,000
look at this you need to go do this it's

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,200
actually something where it's not my

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,559
problem it's not your problem it's all

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,600
of our problems and we have to come

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
together in order to fix it

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,920

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,000
the gary's asset team where we respond

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
back to attackers

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
um i'm also a hacker of things most of

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,720
you guys folks know me as i heart

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,519

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,080
side in previous lives i also did work

37
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,520
on the apt side

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,200
as well as dabbling in crimeware and i'm

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,439
also in oscp uh one of the certs i'm

40
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,119
very happy to have that was a really fun

41
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,759
test when i was

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,960
when i was able to take that um so what

43
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,640
i'm going to be covering today i'm going

44
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,320
to be walking through the current state

45
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,720
of vec and where things are as of right

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,400
now in this point of time

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,960
i'll walking through the 419 problems of

48
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,680
bec

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
i'll also be covering uh what happened

50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,640
in the bec landscape with covid 2020 and

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,079
how a billion dollars was able to be

52
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,960
returned

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,720
uh we'll also be talking about voodoo

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,079
and blood sacrifices because you know

55
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,280
you can't talk about business email

56
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
compromise without talking about fun

57
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,439
things like that

58
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,119
and serious but more importantly

59
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,960
seriously we need to start fixing this

60
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,000
because it's a big

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,880
problem as you'll see um typically i try

62
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
and glaze over hard topics and

63
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,360
everything but we're gonna be covering

64
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,640
it we're gonna be talking death we're

65
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,159
gonna be talking suicide

66
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,000
uh we're gonna be talking psychological

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,079
abuse and it's something where

68
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,520
normally i wouldn't be covering that

69
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
stuff in a technical presentation about

70
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
business email compromise

71
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,200
however these are things that are

72
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
actually happening so you're getting the

73
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,920
100

74
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,280
unfiltered truth on this um as things

75
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
i've seen in the field as things that

76
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
others have seen the field as things

77
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,840
that are actually happening as they're

78
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,640
happening

79
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
so when it's something where i say yep

80
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,599
we're talking about voodoo i'm not

81
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,480
trying to

82
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
mock the stuff i'm going to be talking

83
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,440
to it from the perspective of this is

84
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
actually what the scammers believe and

85
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,480
how they operate

86
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,360
so let's go ahead and get this this off

87
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
um so from the trenches of business

88
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
email compromise

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
it's an absolute mess and to put it into

90
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,080
perspective it's an absolute dumpster

91
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,959
fire and

92
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,560
a lot of times we joke around and we

93
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
throw dumpster fires around in

94
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,200
information security

95
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,519
but this is actually a dumpster fire and

96
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,200
we can prove it mathematically

97
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,519
so according to ic3 um they've been

98
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,480
tracking uh

99
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,959
which is a reporting agency of the fbi

100
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,560
um they have been tracking business

101
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
email compromise for several years now

102
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,159
um and as of september 10th 2019 bec

103
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,400
was responsible for more than 26 billion

104
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,599
lost globally

105
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,120
and to put that into perspective that's

106
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,720
either money that went out and didn't

107
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,239
come back or money that went out and

108
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,519
then was reversed so those were

109
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,879
successful attacks

110
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,280
so you may think okay that's a big

111
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,159
number what

112
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,200
can you go ahead and put that into

113
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,599
context for me so for people

114
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,519
who are who like math and who like

115
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
looking at graphs um the best way to

116
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
see this graph is big pieces of pi bad

117
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,760
small pieces of pie

118
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,080
still bad but less not necessarily less

119
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,599
bad but also important

120
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,760
um so when we actually look at the 2019

121
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
statistics that came out of ic3

122
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
um when we look at business email

123
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
compromise it was responsible for over

124
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
40 percent of

125
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,360
all cyber crime reported to the fbi so

126
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,959
what that means is that if you had a

127
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,640
victim that came and said hey

128
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,239
i lost money can you go ahead and help

129
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,480
me out any victim

130
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,680
that went to the fbi for losses that

131
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
money that's money that was written that

132
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,720
either went out or that was lost so of

133
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,640
all of those crimes that were reported

134
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,519
to the fbi for all of 2019

135
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,200
40 of that was business email compromise

136
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
period there's no debating that and

137
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,640
everything that's

138
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,159
the numbers that they have for all the

139
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,439
crime and the statistics that they've

140
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,079
done

141
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,399
when you start dabbling out and looking

142
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,079
at other parts of bec

143
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,720
you also have things like real estate

144
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,080
scams and romance scams that get

145
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,199
included into that

146
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,800
because they're also part of that pie

147
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,160
and when you start looking at those

148
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,440
other crimes that overlap with it that

149
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
number goes up to almost 70 percent

150
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,360
um including lottery scams which is only

151
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,800
one percent on that

152
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,040
um so i've been saying bec and business

153
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,240
email compromise but

154
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
what is it how can we go ahead and

155
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
actually define that so

156
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
most everybody has seen this type of

157
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
crime in their organization

158
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
and whenever we say bec that's kind of

159
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,199
more umbrella terms to include a lot of

160
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,160
these things

161
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,000
what most people think of bec is

162
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
actually business email spoofing

163
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
or will someone will say hey i'm the ceo

164
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,880
of a company can you go ahead and do an

165
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
urgent wire transfer for me

166
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,000
and then some of the other other end

167
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,120
says yeah i'll be happy to do that

168
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
transfer for you so they'll go ahead and

169
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,120
they'll

170
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
say okay here's a bank account send me

171
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
forty thousand dollars forty thousand

172
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
dollars goes out the door

173
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,639
that's how bec worked um and sometimes

174
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,320
they may say hey i need to take a

175
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
take a look at purchase order uh more

176
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,560
commonly lately uh lately

177
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,919
they've been saying hey can you send me

178
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,680
some gift cards can you pay a vendor

179
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
and then like yes i'll be happy to do

180
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
that let's go ahead and send

181
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
and send that money out everything

182
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,479
should be all happy and hockey dory

183
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,000
but that's actually a scammer on the

184
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
other end who's sending you who's

185
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
trying to have you send that money and

186
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,560
that goes back to the scammers

187
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,479
so when we also we also have to keep in

188
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,720
mind that 419 scams aka

189
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,560
durian print schemes are also part of

190
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,840
this and it's something where we need to

191
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,039
be aware of that

192
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,320
and understand that that's also

193
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
something that's looped into that too

194
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,560
um and the reason is the scammers who

195
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
are doing btc are the same scammers

196
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,080
who's doing the 419 scams

197
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,759
such as your check fraud your

198
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,160
non-delivery scams reshipping schemes

199
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
um and all those other things so there's

200
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,759
a lot once we start

201
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,240
looking at 419 and bec those lines

202
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
really start getting blurry

203
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,199
so some of the things that they do as i

204
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,720
mentioned earlier they do rope the

205
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,319
actors who are doing bec

206
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,560
also do romance scams they'll do wire

207
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,759
fraud which is the

208
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,080
the main thing of bec uh you've got

209
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
lottery scams we've seen cases where

210
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,039
malware has been um

211
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,840
included in it fishing kits account

212
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,960
takeovers uh business email spoofing

213
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,800
again that's kind of what most people

214
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
think of as bec um we've seen the

215
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,919
craigslist scams check for all mystery

216
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,919
shoppers scams some actors have even

217
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,400
used

218
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
money mule romance mules to do drug

219
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
trafficking uh payroll

220
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,759
diversion fake checks have gone to

221
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,919
escorts we've seen rv scams

222
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,840
where they'll go and said hey you won't

223
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,160
buy this rv here you go and it turns out

224
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,199
not to be

225
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,360
um we've seen them do use fools for the

226
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,600
dead um so if somebody is deceased they

227
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,960
will actually get all their social

228
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
security information

229
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
um their credit card information use

230
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
that in order to um

231
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,759
try and steal money from them we've also

232
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,120
seen veteran email compromise where

233
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
they'll compromise a third party

234
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,400
and then try and use that information in

235
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,000
order to come and

236
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
uh take advantage in order to scan that

237
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
person

238
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,199
identity theft human human blood

239
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,800
sacrifices again we'll cover that here

240
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
by the end

241
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,400
um and also 419 crimes i've probably

242
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,440
forgotten

243
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
so one of the win one of the um attacks

244
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,639
that we've seen

245
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,240
that uh was a group that we saw called

246
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,560
silent starling um they really like to

247
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,319
use account takeovers where they would

248
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,160
send phishing kits to organizations and

249
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,039
try and get

250
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,360
emails and passwords for the

251
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,400
organization

252
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
and what they would do is they would set

253
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
up an email forward rule in that inbox

254
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,680
when they set up that email forward rule

255
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
they would have those emails go out to a

256
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
mailbox that they under their control

257
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
so if you as a verse instant responder

258
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,240
saw that

259
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,080
um and saw that their a password was

260
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,039
leaked and you had to go change your

261
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:45,840
password

262
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,599
they still have persistence on that um

263
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,039
account they're still able to siphon

264
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,160
those emails out

265
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,759
and that's exactly how silent starling

266
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,199
would do it is they would try and

267
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,960
they would use man in the mailbox in

268
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
order to siphon those emails off

269
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
and once those emails were off going to

270
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,039
that other um to that email box that

271
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,800
they had under their control

272
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,560
if something such as a purchase order an

273
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,840
invoice or something that was

274
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,520
financially motivating that they could

275
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,560
inject into

276
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,199
they would take that information and

277
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,479
send an account

278
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
um under their or they would send the

279
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
bank account under their control and say

280
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,000
hey

281
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,919
can you do this wire transfer for me

282
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,599
from this account instead

283
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,120
and what they would do is they would

284
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,440
hijack essentially hijack that threat in

285
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,639
that discussion

286
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
and by doing that they would um

287
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,160
essentially take the money um as they

288
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,199
were able to go

289
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,199
um when we were looking at this group we

290
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,799
saw them they had compromised

291
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,679
39 employees at one u.s company uh and

292
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,519
for them there was a five campaigns

293
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,440
between september 2018

294
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
and march 2019 um we also saw another

295
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
case where they had compromised 13 email

296
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,640
accounts in within about 13 minutes

297
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,800
um for one of their february 2019

298
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,080
campaigns so

299
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
one of the things that a lot of people

300
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,360
think of is like oh matt um

301
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,880
bec actors they're simple they're not

302
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,399
doing a lot of stuff but

303
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
in order for an attacker to have hands

304
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,760
on keyboard and have access to the

305
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
information within 30 minutes

306
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,519
that's pretty quick um some of the apts

307
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,560
i've seen in the past

308
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
i've had hands on keyboard within about

309
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,000
20 minutes um but many of them

310
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
move extremely quick just like the just

311
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,360
like the apts

312
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
um to where they're able to go through

313
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,040
and do different things

314
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,560
and you may be like ronnie are you

315
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,320
saying account takeover

316
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,160
and fishing kits are the same and

317
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
related to bec

318
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
yeah that's what i'm saying i'm saying

319
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,720
that from the bbc side we've actually

320
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,640
seen actors using fishing kits

321
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
in order to steal information from your

322
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
organizations

323
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,720
um and this is a mapping of the victims

324
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
that they were able to get

325
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,040
based on fishing based on the logs for

326
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,080
their fishing kits

327
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,600
um so we were able to map back where

328
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
everything was where the actor where the

329
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
actors and the accounts were that they

330
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,240
had compromised

331
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,920
so you may be thinking okay this is an

332
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
isolated event ronnie you're full of it

333
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,959
that's something where account takeover

334
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,000
never happens

335
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,240
so here's another group uh who is doing

336
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,279
it uh this

337
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,519
with this actor we were able to capture

338
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,279
38 unique urls

339
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,160
um for separation campaigns uh this

340
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,279
actor had

341
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,120
uh when we were looking at the actions

342
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
that this actor did

343
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,959
they had done craigslist scams check

344
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,800
fraud credit card fraud

345
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
vehicle advertisement fraud they were

346
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,160
buying and selling or they were

347
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,959
uh trying to get items on depop which is

348
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,360
a

349
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,440
small place to send um where you can

350
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,600
send like small uh products that you're

351
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
making um

352
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,560
they were doing fafsa fraud unemployment

353
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
fraud bank loan fraud they were

354
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,480
targeting california teachers pensions

355
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,560
uh they were doing fema disaster relief

356
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,480
recovery tax refunds

357
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
and this was a group that we called

358
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,320
scatter canary um and when we go and

359
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
actually did digging into this group

360
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,720
this was a very interesting case study

361
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,800
where we were able to uncover over 10

362
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
years of operations for this group

363
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,399
and what we were able to see is this was

364
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,920
one of our very first things where we

365
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,279
were able to get that

366
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,120
um it was kind of opening a can of worms

367
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,200
for us and it kind of unveiled that true

368
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
face of business email compromise and

369
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,519
that

370
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,600
as we look at bec in the industry it's

371
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,640
something where

372
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,279
we only started seeing it once they

373
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,880
started targeting our companies once

374
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,600
they started targeting their

375
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,959
organizations that became a tech

376
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,959
problem however when we actually traced

377
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,240
back that history

378
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
this is something where this has been

379
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,839
persistent long before bec was even a

380
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,680
thing

381
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,279
and with scattered canary that's where

382
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,959
we were able to identify that the actor

383
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,720
had dabbled in romance scams they had

384
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,160
dabbled in check fraud

385
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,839
um they dabbled in many many other

386
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,519
things even before

387
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,600
bec was a thing um when it started

388
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
really taking off in 2015. um

389
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,600
and scattered canary with their

390
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
targeting um that's one of the reasons

391
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,200
that we called them scattered was

392
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
because they would go and target all

393
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,600
these other things

394
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,079
uh they were very much our canary into

395
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:38,720
the um

396
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,279
into our visibility into bec um and how

397
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,399
this stuff works so

398
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
it's something where a lot of the 419

399
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,519
actors who are doing this stuff

400
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,279
are the same people who's doing the bec

401
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
actor there is no difference between

402
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,680
that

403
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
um and it's something where the only

404
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,880
reason that we call it bec is because

405
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,519
it's something where

406
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,040
that's how we track it we track it as

407
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,120
its own unique thing however this is

408
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,440
just

409
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,639
a symptom of something that's been

410
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,320
longer and persisting so it's just new

411
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,680
times and different crimes for a lot of

412
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
the actors

413
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,920
so uh let's go ahead and take a look at

414
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,839
an update for scattered canary because

415
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,320
we

416
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,279
released that document back in 2019 um

417
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,639
they're still around they're still doing

418
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,120
stuff

419
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,600
so they went and started going after

420
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,880
unemployment fraud and

421
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
unemployment benefits so once covered 19

422
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,079
hit

423
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,120
you had a lot of at people in the united

424
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,279
states who were trying to release

425
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,399
unemployment funds

426
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,560
and a lot of different money for the

427
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
people who were having trouble with it

428
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
a lot of people here have lost jobs they

429
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
are losing houses

430
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,120
um they're really struggling right now

431
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,880
so a lot of

432
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
states really tried to push that

433
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,320
unemployment money out as quickly as

434
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,040
they could

435
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,720
to help the people that needed it and

436
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
that's obviously a good thing people are

437
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,959
struggling

438
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,200
let's go ahead and help them out um so

439
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
scatter canary very much

440
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
follows the money and will go wherever

441
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,240
they can in order to make a dollar

442
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,519
so once they started doing the

443
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,279
unemployment funds that was millions of

444
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,200
dollars that went out to

445
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,040
nigeria and specifically the way that we

446
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,279
saw them they would go and file for

447
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,320
their returns

448
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,800
for uh different states and they would

449
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
put them on stuff on the green dot card

450
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
as the green dot card went out

451
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,279
they would receive um a confirmation

452
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
with the bank account and routing number

453
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,399
for that green dot card

454
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,839
so they would go and take the money out

455
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,240
of that card as that card was being sent

456
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,320
to that destination so if you go and

457
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,639
look and see references to where

458
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,240
people started getting a whole lot of

459
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,160
green dot cards that they never received

460
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,000
that's directly related to scattered

461
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
canary and other bec actors

462
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
who were using this specific technique

463
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,600
in order to wire money out

464
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,959
and you're like okay that's just a

465
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,880
couple couple returns how big could that

466
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,680
be

467
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
um it was actually kind of a really big

468
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,279
deal um so much so that hundreds of

469
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,560
millions of dollars was

470
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
actually lost in washington state um and

471
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
specifically

472
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
washington state um had if you start

473
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,079
looking at references they

474
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,399
actually lost a lot of money as well um

475
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,519
i think they have

476
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,680
lost i think it's upwards of 700 million

477
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,560
dollars

478
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,079
um and when we actually look at

479
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,240
unemployment fraud just in general

480
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,079
it's something where there was like 14

481
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,600
states that we're up to now

482
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,320
um hawaii maine massachusetts um new

483
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,160
york was in there if i remember right

484
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,040
um again it's something where a lot of

485
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,399
actors are going after

486
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
the type of money that they can go ahead

487
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
and get just for this fraud

488
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,959
um good news uh i know washington state

489
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
had 500 million dollars reversed

490
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,839
um this this references said says three

491
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,600
but i think 500 million was the total

492
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,639
was the last july saw maryland uh has

493
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,279
also

494
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,160
received 500 million dollars reversed um

495
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,800
for that

496
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,959
so that's over a billion dollars in

497
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
people filing unemployment fraud

498
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,160
uh with a lot of it tied directly to um

499
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,720
bec and 419 actors and groups like

500
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
scatter canary and it's something where

501
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:44,959
i

502
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,240
i've been given a lot of flack in the

503
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,839
industry just because people are like oh

504
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,360
bec isn't really important there's

505
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,839
really not

506
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,480
much to it but at the end of the day do

507
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,560
you think a scammer would rather

508
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
go and spend two years developing a

509
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,399
piece of malware having us researchers

510
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,440
tracking that

511
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
um in order to take only a hundred

512
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,480
million dollars

513
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,160
or do you think they may want to go or

514
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,680
do you think it might be more beneficial

515
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,760
and more cost benefit a better cost for

516
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,160
them

517
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,279
to go and start filing these

518
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
unemployment frauds again

519
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,519
there we again the money that came back

520
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,720
we know of a

521
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
billion dollars that was reversed to

522
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,240
these scams we know a fort

523
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,160
and that's for two states we know of 14

524
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,519
states and guam

525
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,279
it's something where that's a big gap

526
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,839
it's still a lot going

527
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,880
um and it's something where this is very

528
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,480
much a story that's still to be

529
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,360
continued

530
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
uh update for when i did this um for

531
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,040
remote

532
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
for the first conference back in june i

533
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,279
had the sad face but i have now marked

534
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:37,839
out that sad

535
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,880
pace to mit dba happy face again

536
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,639
the story is still to be continued but

537
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,480
it's now a somewhat happy face

538
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,199
so i'm going to leave it at that um some

539
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,560
of the up let's go ahead and take a look

540
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,639
at another actor called uh that we

541
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,240
that we looked at called exaggerated

542
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,000
lion and what they do

543
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,839
is they will actually use real checks

544
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,120
and real victims

545
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,880
in order to go ahead and continue doing

546
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
their fraud so

547
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,480
one of the things that they would do is

548
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
they would send an email to a company

549
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,000
and say hey can you go ahead and make a

550
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,279
vendor payment for me

551
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,560
um i need to go ahead and pay this

552
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,399
invoice and they'll say okay here's

553
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,759
where it needs to go here's the name of

554
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,600
the person needs to be made out to

555
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
and that's and that's how they'll do it

556
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,880
and everything and the

557
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
organization will send that check to

558
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,199
that person um or send it through a

559
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,279
series of mules in order to get it to

560
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,399
that person

561
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,639
um and then that romance victim in the

562
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,000
in the case we saw

563
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,160
they will go and cast that check and not

564
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,600
realize what's happening

565
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,440
um specific to the one romance victim

566
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,199
that we found uh directly related to

567
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,399
exaggerated line

568
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,160
uh they were uh 100 they were

569
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,519
responsible for over a hundred thousand

570
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,639
dollars of fraud

571
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,480
um one of them was responsible for

572
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,560
stealing money from a methodist church

573
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,480
um and something where the scammers were

574
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
able to manipulate and

575
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
um convinced the victim that they were

576
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,800
actually somebody else that they had

577
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,399
said and this person was a hundred

578
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,920
percent of revenant's victim

579
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,600
um i'll be coming back to the i'll be

580
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,959
coming back to romance victims here

581
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,600
shortly

582
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,680
um but just know that with exaggerated

583
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
lie and they were very much directly

584
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,000
tied to

585
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,079
um they were they use a lot of romance

586
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
victims for their operations

587
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,319
um something else that also happens with

588
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,199
a lot of scammers

589
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,839
is fake checks um and when i say fake

590
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,439
checks there's a check that um

591
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,760
if you go and deposit it's gonna bounce

592
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,679
um we've seen things where they'll use

593
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,240
fake checks for products and services um

594
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,439
craigslist is obvious

595
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,199
an obvious one that a lot of attackers

596
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,280
have used um they'll use depop another

597
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
person-to-person product websites

598
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
typically those are non-delivery scams

599
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
um where they'll say

600
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
hey go ahead and ship and send this i'll

601
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
send you a check for two thousand

602
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,120
dollars

603
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,480
oh it's 3500 go ahead and just

604
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,880
cash it keep a couple of it and then

605
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,320
give this send the money over to this

606
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,360
person here

607
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,799
um and it's something where once the

608
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
product gets shipped the money gets cash

609
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,600
you're pretty much out everything and

610
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,520
that's just how the scheme works

611
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
um another angle that we've seen based

612
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,799
on the

613
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
based on the bbc actors is we've seen

614
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,120
references of mystery shopper scams

615
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,640
um what they'll do is they'll go ahead

616
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,720
and they'll create a website asking for

617
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,559
uh mystery shoppers they'll have them

618
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,000
fill out the information send them a

619
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,320
check

620
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
and there we go that's how this stuff

621
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,760
works they'll go and get their money the

622
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,559
money is sent

623
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,360
and again all that money gets lost um

624
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,600
what really sucks is when you have cases

625
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
where you see so much of this fraud

626
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,280
you have a hundred and sixties checks

627
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,880
sent to 30 states

628
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,039
and you have absolutely no idea who to

629
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,000
pass that to

630
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
because again when your check is

631
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,760
something where it's under 2500

632
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,919
okay that's now a state level and you

633
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,760
now have that's now state level fraud

634
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,520
then you have these 160 checks do you

635
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,960
give that over to

636
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,320
postal inspectors where they can go

637
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,679
ahead and see the stuff do you pass over

638
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,200
to the fbi because

639
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,559
you had all of these other states that

640
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,160
were involved and it really and that

641
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
becomes a lot of a big problem with

642
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,960
fighting bec

643
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,280
and a lot of these related informations

644
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,440
and a lot of this related fraud rather

645
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,080
where it really becomes a point of you

646
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,960
see so much fraud that you have no

647
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,640
that centralization you would think okay

648
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
pass out to the fbi but again it's

649
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
something where there is this fraud is

650
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
so large and so rampant

651
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
that it becomes extremely difficult to

652
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
start trying to file and process this

653
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
and trying to understand that

654
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,039
another place where we saw fake checks

655
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,280
um sent was they were targeting escorts

656
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,440
and they were and in those emails they

657
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,640
were like hey can you offer my client

658
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,440
companionship

659
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,039
um he be charming uh conversational

660
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,440
have a sense of humor um and with this

661
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,280
one we saw them targeting escorts out in

662
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
washington dc so i don't know about you

663
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
but i'm gonna go out on the limb and say

664
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,799
that those checks probably were not

665
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,400
reported to law enforcement

666
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,240
um just because it's something where you

667
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
normally wouldn't

668
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
have that those type of checks being

669
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,600
reported um and something where i don't

670
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
know the legality in dc but something

671
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,160
where

672
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,000
they prob that was probably even more

673
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
fraud that the act that the scammers had

674
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,440
gotten that more money went out

675
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,679
um so speaking of other laws other

676
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,120
crimes that don't get reported to law

677
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,919
enforcement

678
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,280
let's go ahead and start talking about

679
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
romance scams um when we start looking

680
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,760
at romance scams and we start looking at

681
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
bec and we start looking at that entire

682
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
ecosystem

683
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,320
your actor needs some sort of

684
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,400
infrastructure so just as we have

685
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,919
malware samples just have we have

686
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,159
ip addresses domains associated with

687
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,039
that um

688
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,559
business email compromises are the same

689
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,840
way and they need some sort of

690
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,960
infrastructure in order to do their

691
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,159
operations

692
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,480
for them and for a lot of nigerian

693
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,679
scammers as a whole

694
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,159
um they like to use romance victims and

695
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,039
what they'll do

696
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039
is they will use the a network of

697
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,400
romance mules in order to move money

698
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,159
from here to here to here

699
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,720
and in order to actually convince them

700
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,600
they will become

701
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
in a relationship with that person and

702
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,960
they will actually fool them

703
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
into saying yes i'm actually in a

704
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
relationship where

705
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,760
um i'm gonna start sending you pictures

706
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
of myself and everything and oh yeah by

707
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,240
the way can you wire

708
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
can you send this cash for me the thing

709
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
that sucks the most is the amount of

710
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,480
emotional and psychological damage

711
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,720
that goes along with roman with romance

712
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,080
victims and romance scams

713
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,600
and some of the stories that we've seen

714
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,360
is absolutely heartbreaking

715
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,120
uh it's some of the worst crime that i

716
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,480
have seen um

717
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,799
out there just because you can a lot of

718
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,640
the people tend up emotionally

719
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,600
and mostly and psychologically abused

720
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,080
and

721
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,840
it really leaves a person just trying to

722
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,360
figure out what's real and not because

723
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,120
they were completely lied to

724
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
based on what they saw so the way that

725
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
this works with a lot of the victims

726
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,440
um that we've seen um they will actually

727
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,720
build profiles in order to start

728
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,799
engaging with their potential victims

729
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,039
um they'll go ahead and try and build

730
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,480
trust with the victim and say and say

731
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,919
very loving things

732
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,600
um yes i want to go ahead and be in a

733
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,840
relationship with you i'm over here in

734
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,120
this far country

735
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,640
um but something where we want to try

736
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,000
and have a relationship so let's try and

737
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,039
work this out

738
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,520
um in the case of exaggerated lion uh

739
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,440
that in order to convince that person to

740
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,960
go and cast checks for

741
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
a methodist church in order to go and

742
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,520
cast checks for these other victims too

743
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,000
that uh that scammer told the victim

744
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,039
that it was for her inheritance so the

745
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:49,840
victim

746
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,480
the entire time he was operating the

747
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,000
stuff he actually thought he was in

748
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
relationship with the with a woman

749
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,440
uh the relationship went on for two and

750
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,600
a half years and every time he cast a

751
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,880
check he thought wasn't

752
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,120
he thought it was taxes for the lawyer

753
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
for her inheritance

754
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,480
and if it's something where if my wife

755
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,440
asked me hey can you go and open the

756
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,720
bank account for me of course i'm gonna

757
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,360
do it

758
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
so a lot of these victims actually think

759
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,679
that they're in this relationship

760
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,200
and in the case of exaggerated line the

761
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,559
bank says the check's okay so it's gotta

762
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,360
be okay

763
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,880
and how do you actually control someone

764
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,919
and that's what they'll do is they'll

765
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,360
tug on those heart strings in order to

766
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
manipulate those people

767
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
it's doing whatever they want them to

768
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,240
and you're probably looking at me right

769
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
now going uh romance scams fake checks

770
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,919
be easy really ronnie

771
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,679
um but no again it's something where

772
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
we've actually seen this directly tied

773
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,280
to a lot of bec actors and a lot of the

774
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,480
way that they operate

775
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,640
um the one case we saw we saw craigslist

776
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,320
scams to send fake checks to work from

777
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,360
home victims

778
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
uh we saw them targeting uh farmers

779
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,919
dating ashley madison bdm bdsm dating

780
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:46,720
websites

781
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,520
uh tax fraud literally the same account

782
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,039
literally the same actor

783
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,640
literally the same inbox i mean i i

784
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,760
can't argue with

785
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
where it's all the same stuff so it's

786
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,840
something where it's like this is just

787
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,280
how this stuff works

788
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,960
these actors are not doing one type of

789
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,799
crime they're not doing just bec they're

790
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,200
doing

791
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
all these other things in order to try

792
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
and send money back and forth

793
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,480
and in order to engage with their

794
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,559
romance victims uh they'll use what they

795
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,400
call scripts and formats in order to

796
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,360
engage with this

797
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,600
in in order to engage with their victims

798
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,520
so this is larry he's a single

799
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,000
divorce with three two and three kids uh

800
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,440
per the script and he'll say hi

801
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
beautiful how are you

802
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
um i'm widowed and i'm just looking for

803
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,400
a new relationship

804
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,080
and this is the type of stuff that your

805
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,440
victims will get

806
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,840
um and just as we have debugging

807
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,559
information

808
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,200
in um on the malware side there's cases

809
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,320
where it's like okay you need to go

810
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,880
ahead and

811
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,000
uh put your eip make sure eip is equal

812
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
to this put your jump here

813
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,279
in order to go ahead and do this section

814
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,279
here but if your malware blows up you

815
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,840
got to do this thing here

816
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,360
um likewise these romance scripts have

817
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,720
the same have similar debugging

818
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,760
information too

819
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
um where they may say okay if you're sk

820
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
if your person is getting

821
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,919
um skeptical go ahead and tell them this

822
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,600
or if this thing happens here tell them

823
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,240
that

824
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
um in order to kind of keep that

825
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,279
conversation going um

826
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,799
we've seen some of these where it's

827
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,520
upwards of like 28 and 30 layers deep

828
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,840
before in order to engage back and forth

829
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,039
with the victim so

830
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,960
your victim so your scammer doesn't have

831
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,799
to think about what they're saying they

832
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,320
can just copy paste this block and text

833
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,200
back and forth

834
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
and that's what allows them to target

835
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
many many people during a day

836
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,400
is they were able to have all the stuff

837
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,720
to where they can send back and forth

838
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
if you remember there was a screenshot

839
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,120
back from exaggerated live with a 16 000

840
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,440
check um this was going back to the

841
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,320
vendor payment

842
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,400
and again that quote-unquote vendor was

843
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,840
actually a romance victim

844
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,919
so what that romance victim did was he

845
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,440
went and deposited that check through

846
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,960
bank account over the brand new uh brand

847
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,159
new check account

848
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,960
um and uh you could tell that everybody

849
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,360
on

850
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,960
the sides of the bank were skeptical

851
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,279
because that the check after the 10 days

852
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,520
it went for another day of verification

853
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,240
but if something was a real check it was

854
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,039
the name

855
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,799
and it went it was able to go through

856
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,159
and it cleared fine

857
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,279
um initially the actor wanted um

858
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,000
wanted their victim to deposit the money

859
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,720
to a

860
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,520
bitcoin uh atm unfortunately the closest

861
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,440
bitcoin atm was about two and a half

862
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
hours away from the victim

863
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,760
um so what he did was he sent fifteen

864
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,559
thousand dollars

865
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,279
in cash in the fedex box set to a second

866
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:19,919
romance

867
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,320
victim and when looking at the check the

868
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,840
check had touched

869
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,600
um one other state before it ended up

870
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,960
coming to texas

871
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,360
and then that account got um and then

872
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,600
that account was created in texas

873
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
victim went and deposited the check

874
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,279
withdrew the check and then sent fifteen

875
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,279
thousand dollars in cash over to rogers

876
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,240
arkansas

877
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
so it's something where exaggerated line

878
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,360
a lot of

879
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,200
actors will use very very

880
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,039
they will go many steps in order to make

881
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,039
sure that money um touches as many

882
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,080
people as they can

883
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,480
to make it that much more difficult to

884
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,600
detect this stuff

885
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,960
the other thing too is when you go and

886
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,400
actually talk to this romance victim and

887
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,440
you say okay

888
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,320
i went and you committed this type of

889
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,919
fraud your victim's gonna come back and

890
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,440
be like no i never committed this fraud

891
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,799
i was cashing it for

892
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,320
my girlfriend's inheritance because of

893
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,640
the lawyer so even as a law enforcement

894
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,240
person going to talk to

895
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,400
a lot of these victims the story becomes

896
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,559
very money very distorted

897
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,000
and actually getting to the truth of

898
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,679
what really really happened

899
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
becomes extremely difficult and that's

900
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,520
another problem of bec

901
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
is that it becomes it's very hard to

902
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,240
actually uncover what's really going on

903
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,679
um another case where we saw um we own

904
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,360
and this was a reference we only had the

905
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,679
passwords but i will let you guys be the

906
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,720
ones to draw those

907
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,919
uh similar conclusions so with this uh

908
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,159
victim we only had names and passwords

909
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,400
um initially she started off with things

910
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
like forever for you

911
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,080
strong for you um and eventually her

912
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,640
passwords

913
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,400
were changing and she was sending the

914
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,919
passwords to

915
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,600
the scammers for the accounts and

916
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,039
everything and she was creating accounts

917
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,919
for

918
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,799
the um and she was creating accounts for

919
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,159
the scammer to use

920
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,679
um and again some of those accounts

921
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,440
where we are we are forever uh two

922
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
hearts one love so you could tell

923
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,840
clearly

924
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,360
that this is something where this is

925
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
going this is more than likely a romance

926
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,159
victim um unfortunately as time went on

927
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,400
you started seeing uh clear degradation

928
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,679
in the passwords

929
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,919
um such as like too tired for this too

930
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,120
much mystery

931
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,200
and the final correspondence that we saw

932
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,240
with the victim

933
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,760
um was the victim had sent her ira

934
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,679
account to the scammers

935
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,159
unfortunately we don't have any evidence

936
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,760
that they had cashed out

937
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
but the actor had all the information

938
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,520
that they needed in order to cash out

939
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,240
that ira

940
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,120
fund um and unfortunately a month later

941
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,880
we saw that jane had passed away

942
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,120
we were able to map back who the victim

943
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,039
was we found her obituary

944
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,760
um it turns out that with jane she was a

945
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,360
stay-at-home mom of three kids

946
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,760
uh she was very much loved spending time

947
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,640
with the grandkids

948
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,039
but unfortunately um the husband was out

949
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,640
of the picture wasn't really sure what

950
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,000
happened with the husband there

951
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,760
um and the kids had lived in other parts

952
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,039
of the country um

953
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,720
and it was something where all along

954
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,039
jane just wanted to be loved and she

955
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,039
all through her life she had people and

956
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,640
she had people there at the house

957
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,520
where she was homeschooling the kids she

958
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
really enjoyed just spending time with

959
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,000
family

960
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,399
but she was single she was alone she

961
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,200
wanted love

962
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,600
and she ended up on the wrong side of

963
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,799
this scam

964
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,799
and eventually she ended up cashing out

965
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,960
once she sent the stuff the ira account

966
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,840
to

967
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,120
the um to the scammers and everything

968
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,640
they went we really think that they went

969
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,399
and cashed that out and everything

970
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,640
um a month after she passed away they

971
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,960
started filing for auto loans

972
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,840
um in her name um so yeah they were

973
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,559
doing that

974
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,600
after she died uh broom bro so

975
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
another wonderful thing uh not wonderful

976
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,720
at all

977
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
um is that we've also seen suicide

978
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,240
attempts related to this

979
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
so with one of the romance victims that

980
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,840
we saw they were purchasing gift cards

981
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,960
for the actor

982
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,000
um and this woman became paranoid and

983
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
delusional that people were after her

984
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,559
um and unfortunately she had a right to

985
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,919
be paranoid that people were watching

986
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:02,960
her because

987
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,799
this the actor had actually hacked into

988
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,240
her account and was watching all of her

989
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,200
emails

990
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,600
um so much so that there was one point

991
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,240
where

992
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,000
she became extremely frustrated and

993
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
flustered and the scammer's like do you

994
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,960
want to talk to my friend at the cia and

995
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,320
she's like yeah so

996
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,840
the scammer went and we think the

997
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,679
skimmer and open another account

998
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,399
talk to her quote unquote from the cia

999
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,760
and

1000
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,159
um was able to calm her down um

1001
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,440
unfortunately she attempted

1002
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,000
to commit suicide and she actually went

1003
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and told the scammer she was like i lost

1004
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
it i tried to commit suicide my mother

1005
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,039
had me committed

1006
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,120
and the instead of the scare being like

1007
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
oh i'm sorry i was a scammer

1008
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
the scammer took this as a wonderful

1009
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,880
opportunity to send her a picture and

1010
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,440
say

1011
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,279
you know this is me i've always i've

1012
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,360
always been here for you and everything

1013
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,120
in order to try and reel in that

1014
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,880
relationship and be like okay yes you

1015
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,399
tried to commit suicide

1016
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,640
but no i'm gonna keep using you for

1017
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,720
check fraud and a week within a week she

1018
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,240
they were sending um

1019
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,520
they were sending using that person in

1020
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,679
order to send fake checks um

1021
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,320
as mentioned with gift cards um gift

1022
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,600
card fraud is something that's very

1023
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,520
popular with scammers as well

1024
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,600
and what bec actors and other related

1025
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,640
actors will do

1026
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,399
is they'll usually use something like

1027
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,399
hey this is your employee actor reward

1028
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,279
program

1029
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,799
um in order to try and get that person

1030
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,559
to go and buy cards so they'll make

1031
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,159
they'll say hey go ahead and send

1032
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,080
pictures of the cards and we'll go ahead

1033
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,360
and we'll use that

1034
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,279
um in order to reward the in order to

1035
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,200
reward our employees

1036
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,640
specifically the way that they use this

1037
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,240
is they'll use bitcoin

1038
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,720
and um other currency they'll use

1039
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,000
bitcoin and other related

1040
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,240
exchanges in order to convert the gift

1041
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,039
cards to

1042
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,679
bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

1043
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,480
excuse me

1044
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,919
so they could go ahead and continue

1045
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,480
cashing that out so if you have to send

1046
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,919
them like a hundred dollar gift card for

1047
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:48,640
example

1048
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,399
they can then take that convert that

1049
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,720
over to 70 worth of bitcoin

1050
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,159
and at that point something where they

1051
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,840
don't have to

1052
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,760
continue manipulating a romance victim a

1053
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,120
romance fuel and send it through this

1054
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,320
network of mules

1055
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,080
they can just directly get their cash

1056
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,159
out in bitcoin and it's something where

1057
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,760
not only are they able to bypass the

1058
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,360
banking processes it's something where

1059
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,720
tracking bitcoin becomes much more

1060
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,080
difficult on that

1061
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,840
um the other thing too is very much what

1062
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,279
i've kind of mentioned is that there are

1063
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,200
so many gaps in bec

1064
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,960
that as we're starting to understand

1065
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
this a lot of victims don't even know

1066
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,919
they're victims

1067
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,200
and that's the unfortunate thing with a

1068
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,720
lot of stuff is that when you go and

1069
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,760
talk to

1070
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,399
this person who's sending that money to

1071
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,679
them and in their mind

1072
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,279
they're actually in a relationship with

1073
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,799
this person however

1074
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,120
on the up on the opposite side it's

1075
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,919
something where

1076
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,440
the scammer is actually manipulating

1077
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,120
them in order to believe these things

1078
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
they're telling them lies in order to

1079
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,440
continue using them as a mule and when

1080
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,039
you actually talk with these romance

1081
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,399
victims it's something where it

1082
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,559
completely blows their mind and

1083
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,080
unfortunately a lot of them stay

1084
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
in the scheme because again it's

1085
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,919
something where it's extremely traumatic

1086
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:52,399
to

1087
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,919
pull themselves out of that they've had

1088
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,200
all of these emotions all of these

1089
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,559
positive emotions with it

1090
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,880
so they're like okay this can't be real

1091
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,519
this can't be fake it has to be real

1092
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,519
um and the other thing too again not all

1093
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,360
these crimes are reported because

1094
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,120
if you've been victimized and if you

1095
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,559
were taken advantage of

1096
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,000
and you wouldn't cast hundreds of

1097
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,679
thousands of dollars you're gonna feel

1098
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,279
guilty for doing this type of work and

1099
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,480
that's the problem

1100
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,799
is a lot of these victims won't talk and

1101
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,320
a lot of these victims frankly don't

1102
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,200
want to talk

1103
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,960
at something where if they feel that

1104
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,320
horrible about it

1105
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,640
um they're just not going to go and

1106
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,159
willingly talk about it

1107
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,000
additionally when you go and actually

1108
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,279
start engaging with a lot of these

1109
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,000
people

1110
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,039
um law enforcement in some cases

1111
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,799
will be very demeaning to that victim so

1112
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,399
in some cases when they go and talk of

1113
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,840
them they'll actually treat them as

1114
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,880
being stupid

1115
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
and it's something where if you're

1116
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,000
working with a victim

1117
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,080
you can't do that because if you're

1118
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,480
treating a victim as less than human

1119
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,679
they're not going to want to talk to you

1120
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,640
and they're not going to be willing to

1121
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,760
work with you so you have to be

1122
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,720
understanding you have to be

1123
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,159
compassionate on some of this

1124
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,240
in order to understand the psychological

1125
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,159
abuse and what's really going on

1126
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,919
a lot of these victims really go through

1127
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,320
a lot and some of the um a lot of places

1128
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,000
and myself being included on this

1129
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,360
we don't call them victims we call them

1130
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,720
survivors just because they've been

1131
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,039
through

1132
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,919
that much trauma over the years and the

1133
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,440
scammers have pushed them that far in a

1134
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,559
lot of things

1135
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,960
um the other thing too specifically day

1136
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,559
gaps 160 checks

1137
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,279
30 states how do you track that a list

1138
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,519
of 2 000 w 2 sent from a company that

1139
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,120
you report that fraud to

1140
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,840
it becomes very very hard to track all

1141
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,720
these things

1142
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
and actually try and get convictions for

1143
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,399
this type of crime and something where

1144
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,919
all through the fighting of bec that

1145
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,120
we've done over the years

1146
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,640
we've learned a whole heck of a lot of

1147
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
things about how this works

1148
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,600
but unfortunately there's a lot that we

1149
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,039
don't know and unfortunately there's

1150
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,399
even more that we don't of things that

1151
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,399
we don't know that we don't know

1152
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,360
some of the facts of bec bec is 40 of

1153
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,200
all cyber crime reported ic3

1154
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,880
uh when you start including that it's

1155
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,519
over 70 percent of the fraud

1156
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,200
um as reported to them when you start

1157
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,399
including other things like romance

1158
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,080
scams that are directly related to this

1159
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,360
stuff and actually use as part of that

1160
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,480
infrastructure

1161
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,039
um we know 25 billion dollars in losses

1162
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,559
tons of emotional damage

1163
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,360
um death suicide and depression tied to

1164
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,840
this stuff lost homes lost mortgages

1165
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,679
uh lost life savings and again that's

1166
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,119
just what we know and just

1167
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,800
with stewie this is probably gonna be

1168
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,639

1169
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,760
and everything thinking man there's a

1170
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,639
lot of things that are actually

1171
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,000
overlapping there

1172
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,079
but when we talk about the romance

1173
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,000
victims we can't actually talk about

1174
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,879
those victims

1175
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,399
without talking about the victims in

1176
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,320
nigeria and again you're probably

1177
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,879
looking

1178
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,719
absolutely nuts being like okay wait

1179
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,079
you're now talk

1180
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,239
saying that the scammers are victims you

1181
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,520
know what when you actually start

1182
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,560
digging into that

1183
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,079
it's something where those lines also

1184
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,520
start to learn too and there's a lot

1185
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,960
more that's driving

1186
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,239
bec than we actually realize

1187
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,480
so one of the problems in nigeria is

1188
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,159
there's a very deep culture of

1189
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,119
corruption

1190
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,199
and it's something where the government

1191
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,960
is all the police and the government is

1192
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,239
extremely corrupted

1193
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,000
um bribes and stealing for money is

1194
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
something that's very common and that

1195
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,440
happens and they're fairly regular

1196
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
um i started digging into trying to

1197
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,280
understand like what people in nigeria

1198
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,480
have to go through

1199
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,720
um and in 2015 there was an incident

1200
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,480
where a cop had asked a cab driver for

1201
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,560
um the equivalent of 10 us dollars and

1202
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,520
everything

1203
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,920
um the driver didn't have the money so

1204
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,839
he didn't give it give them the money

1205
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,599
so what the cop did was he got out of

1206
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,520
the car he shot the driver

1207
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,280
and he shot the pregnant wife in the

1208
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,200
back the driver's pregnant wife in the

1209
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,160
back in the head

1210
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,680
who was back in the back seat and

1211
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,520
everything driving with the person

1212
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,119
that's some of the problems that and

1213
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,560
that's a level of corruption that goes

1214
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,160
through some of these things

1215
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
um additionally there's an absolutely

1216
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,280
horrible job market

1217
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,160
in nigeria right now um it's not really

1218
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
easy to make money in nigeria

1219
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,760
um the current youth unemployment rate

1220
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,359
is over 50 percent

1221
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,160
and for the youth that's defined as

1222
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,200
anyone between the ages of 15 and 35

1223
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,960
um so it's something where culturally it

1224
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,800
becomes extremely difficult

1225
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,000
for people to actually find work um

1226
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,599
there are no unemployment benefits in

1227
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,280
nigeria like there are here

1228
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,119
where if you're out of work you can't go

1229
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,520
and get help it's just

1230
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,599
you're done that's it there's no help

1231
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,960
for you um

1232
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,119
and k and we actually saw one case where

1233
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,280
an actor spent 16 months trying to apply

1234
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,240
for jobs

1235
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,520
they applied for work outside the

1236
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,440
country they had applied for visas

1237
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,640
they tried to actually get out of

1238
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,960
nigeria and couldn't find a job and they

1239
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,359
had

1240
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,119
to go and become a scammer because again

1241
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,480
they were just trying to

1242
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,240
make a livelihood in order to just

1243
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,920
continue doing this stuff

1244
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,720
um the other thing is that voodoo and

1245
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,599
money rituals

1246
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,160
play very very close with the yahoo boys

1247
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,800
aka

1248
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,079
what the scammers are called on the

1249
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,200
ground um the thing is that with voodoo

1250
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,880
and money rituals the way that these

1251
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,760
work

1252
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,920
is that a lot of scammers in order to

1253
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,000
continue doing this type of work

1254
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,240
they will go and get these certain types

1255
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,920
of blessings in order to do this so it

1256
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
may be something where

1257
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,160
they may need to drink this one thing um

1258
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,560
or

1259
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,880
do this and that um in order to kind of

1260
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,560
keep going through and continue

1261
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,520
operating

1262
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,880
um here's one case where someone um

1263
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,680
almost tried to almost uh was used as a

1264
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,880
human sacrifice

1265
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,839
um as one of these um as one of these

1266
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:06,960
type of scams

1267
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,720
um and specifically this is called yahoo

1268
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,880
plus where you're where as a yahoo boy

1269
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,839
you can be quote

1270
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,480
promoted to the next level of yahoo boy

1271
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,240
and a lot of cases for those blood

1272
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,359
sacrifices

1273
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,079
um it requires a human sacrifice so

1274
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,839
here's another instance where's uh it

1275
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,040
was four people

1276
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,440
it was four people two were arrested um

1277
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,880
they actually killed their grandmother

1278
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,680
in order to

1279
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,000
try and do this type of fraud um in

1280
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,440
order to continue doing this type of

1281
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,480
thing and again

1282
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,640
this is just the truth of how this stuff

1283
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,400
works a lot of your scammers will

1284
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,079
actually do these rituals do these type

1285
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:38,800
of things

1286
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,960
um in order to bless their earnings and

1287
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,480
once they bless their earnings

1288
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,599
they will become that much more

1289
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,440
confident and go for a higher amount so

1290
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,680
it's kind it becomes this vicious cycle

1291
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,200
where they just continue doing this more

1292
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,800
and more and more um

1293
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,920
additionally just as we have moms here

1294
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,839
who will be part of a football group

1295
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,920
and who will make things like lasagna

1296
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,960
for um

1297
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,800
for your football team you also have

1298
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
mother of yahoo boys so

1299
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,079
mother of yahoo boys now has an

1300
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,440
association and

1301
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,839
the mother of the yahoo boys will now go

1302
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,839
and uh work to help

1303
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,640
um will go and help cover and help

1304
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,240
protect a lot of these people who's

1305
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,960
doing

1306
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,040
this type of fraud because again it

1307
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,960
comes out with a lot of yahoo boys who

1308
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,200
are

1309
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,520
who have this money are now putting it

1310
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,440
back into the country so now it becomes

1311
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,400
a case of

1312
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,839
what's good and bad locally on the

1313
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,200
ground because again you see all this

1314
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,880
poverty you see all this death

1315
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,520
you see all of these police officers who

1316
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,960
were going committing fraud

1317
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,520
and shooting pregnant pregnant wives in

1318
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,320
the head

1319
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,400
um and you and you're like okay i'm

1320
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,520
gonna go steal from a couple people

1321
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
across the ocean

1322
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
and it really becomes a thing where okay

1323
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,480
if this is how bad it really is on the

1324
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,000
ground nigeria and they're stealing

1325
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
some money from a romance victim to them

1326
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,359
it's really not all that bad

1327
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,640
because again it's a matter of putting

1328
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,240
all that into perception to understand

1329
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,359
the struggles that a lot of these

1330
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,280
cameras are really going through

1331
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,680
um it's something where voodoo again has

1332
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,920
also been closely tied with bec

1333
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,800
419 um and krebs actually covered this

1334
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,560
back in 2013.

1335
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,400
um that was something where again it's

1336
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,760
like okay trying to talk about that

1337
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,800
black magic and that

1338
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,599
that the yahoo boys are practicing in

1339
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,079
order to continue doing this fraud and

1340
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,280
again it's now

1341
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
becoming less of a okay let's go and

1342
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,200
rest everybody it's now becoming an

1343
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,960
ideology fight where we now have to

1344
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
understand this because again

1345
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,839
we can go and put all these people in

1346
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,079
jail all day long but until we actually

1347
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:26,400
start

1348
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,000
understanding how the criminals work and

1349
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,599
how they operate we're never going to

1350
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,720
make any headway

1351
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
um it's something where yes for us here

1352
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,079
in the states tricking some of that

1353
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,599
money yeah that's bad

1354
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,200
and to them they feel like if they can

1355
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,720
full may if they can trick you out of

1356
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
that money aka make you fall mugu

1357
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,640
then it's something where it's free game

1358
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,000
um a lot scampers

1359
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,839
a lot of the scammers will also use

1360
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,240
reparation as an excuse in order to

1361
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,320
um continue scamming and they feel like

1362
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,599
because um

1363
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,520
people who are white have stolen from

1364
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,440
people in nigeria all these years

1365
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,720
they're like we're just taking our money

1366
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,200
back so that's another motivation for a

1367
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,000
lot of them

1368
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,480
um again yahoo boys give back to nigeria

1369
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,560
so again it becomes extremely difficult

1370
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,960
uh ministers government officials are in

1371
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,720
it it's okay to pay somebody off

1372
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,560
um so it becomes really really difficult

1373
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,800
to start tracking a lot of this stuff

1374
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,119
again you have some high profile actors

1375
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,960
such as hus puppy who get involved with

1376
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,680
this

1377
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,760
um again it's something where with the

1378
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,200
poverty in nigeria

1379
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,240
that's something that we have to

1380
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,920
understand we have to see is that

1381
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,440
there's a ton of problems in there

1382
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,800
there's some locals who hate the

1383
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,680
scammers

1384
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,520
but again it's something where we have

1385
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,119
to understand all of these things that

1386
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,560
are related to it

1387
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,319
um and it's something where if you had

1388
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,839
the choice of picking a good life for

1389
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,440
your family or living in poverty what

1390
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,560
would you pick

1391
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,000
i've never been in that position to

1392
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,839
where i've had to try and

1393
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,000
go and scam somebody just to survive but

1394
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,440
again this is the choices that last

1395
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,560
gamers have

1396
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,160
and again starting to wrap up but

1397
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,079
something where a lot of peop other

1398
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,319
things are related to 419 scams

1399
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,760
you got human trafficking drug

1400
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,000
trafficking money laundering and again a

1401
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,079
dozen scams i miss as part of this

1402
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,839
again it's the same actors doing the

1403
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,520
same thing and seriously it's an

1404
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,720
absolute mess

1405
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,839
and it's clearly defined as a dumpster

1406
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,400
fire oh

1407
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
and uh in order to make this bec

1408
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,920
dumpster fire worse russia is getting

1409
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,800
into it too

1410
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,560
uh we saw a group called cosmic lynx

1411
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,640
that was targeting 46 countries

1412
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,920
uh in mid-2019 we also saw overlaps in

1413
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,319
infrastructure with emote and trickbot

1414
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,760
um the infrastructure that they were

1415
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,520
hosted on um was

1416
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,720
uh they were using some of those

1417
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,359
families too we were we were not under

1418
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:27,839
clear

1419
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,359
if it was something where it's the same

1420
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,119
actors doing the same thing

1421
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,280
but there was clear overlaps with some

1422
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,560
of those groups

1423
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,640
these scammers are very well written

1424
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,880
we've seen japanese french and english

1425
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,240
and in every case

1426
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,200
uh it was very clear it was very clearly

1427
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,040
written as almost like a local wrote

1428
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,599
that

1429
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,520
um they asked for much higher amounts so

1430
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
again why use malware

1431
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,640
when you can just ask for money and

1432
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,319
again we're now starting to try and

1433
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,319
fight the stigma of bec

1434
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,680
that there's a lot of fraud there's a

1435
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,119
lot of things that are overlapping with

1436
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,640
it and again it often gets brushed under

1437
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,160
the table of oh it's low tech and

1438
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,960
unemployment

1439
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,720
like unimportant but again that's what's

1440
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,480
causing the biggest piece of the pie

1441
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,560
why go and focus on a two percent

1442
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,000
problem when we can go and focus on the

1443
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,640
70

1444
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,960
problem again this is all of the

1445
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,560
information you guys have access to the

1446
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,240
information just as well as i do

1447
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,280
the statistics are out there ic3 2019

1448
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,760
report

1449
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,079
file type pdf that's how you that's how

1450
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,040
you find it

1451
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,800
again we're also finding the stigma

1452
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,640
stigma of romance victims falling

1453
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,720
victim to this um and a lot of them

1454
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,839
again get uh

1455
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,079
get chalked up to being a stupid user

1456
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,200
but again just because you have

1457
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,480
different knowledge just because you

1458
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,760
went through life

1459
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,119
and you learned different things doesn't

1460
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,520
make you stupid just because

1461
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,119
you may not know how to rebuild an

1462
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,480
engine just because you may not know how

1463
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:40,880
to

1464
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,680
map a protein in a genetic structure or

1465
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,640
thai efficient war

1466
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,079
that doesn't make you less smart than

1467
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,440
somebody else just you want got

1468
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,480
different knowledge

1469
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,240
um as you went through life and maybe

1470
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,760
it's us who's the weird ones

1471
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,280
and maybe we need to start having a

1472
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,640
little patience with these victims

1473
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,839
because again they're being used and

1474
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,880
manipulated

1475
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,240
and we have to start explaining that

1476
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,000
stuff to them um

1477
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,359
and again some of the failures that

1478
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,040
we've had in fighting the ec

1479
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,359
is is absolutely massive and that's how

1480
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,720
it needs to be treated

1481
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,400
again a lot of people will go and fight

1482
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
bec and see think of it as one

1483
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,680
individual silo

1484
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,359
but again that's a symptom of something

1485
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,200
that has been long persisting for

1486
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,240
multiple years before that we really

1487
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,280
really really really

1488
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,720
really desperately need more people

1489
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,400
talking about more people looking at it

1490
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,160
more people diving into it because again

1491
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,520
as one of the people who

1492
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
tracks this stuff every single break

1493
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,280
every single waking hour and

1494
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,520
with every breath it's an absolute mess

1495
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,440
we need to start um and we really need

1496
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,720
to start doing it

1497
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,319
and again if bec is something that's

1498
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,640
that easy why don't we take a year or

1499
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,160
something to start addressing to start

1500
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,680
fixing it so that we can just clean this

1501
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,760
crap up and make it go away

1502
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,400
and again the best way to eat the ebec

1503
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,920
elephant is one bite at a time with a

1504
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,119
lot of friends

1505
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,960
so in closing i've been updating the

1506
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,920
slide since 2016 i got tired of updating

1507
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,640
it so

1508
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,040
this is bec losses that we know here's

1509
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,720
literally everything else and whatnot

1510
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,640
and again we can report that stuff uh

1511
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,119
mathematically as coming from ic3

1512
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,880
so it's something where it's an absolute

1513
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,319
mass

1514
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,160
here are my sources for a lot of the

1515
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,680
screenshots and everything

1516
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,319
and i think i am right at time if i am

1517
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,680
looking at my clock right

1518
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
so again are there any questions or

1519
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,960
whatnot um

1520
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,720

1529
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,960
of the engages that we do too with the

1530
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,240
actors

1531
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,319
