1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,120
all right

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,440
thank you and welcome everyone to

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,120
confidence 2020

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,679
my name is vitaly cremas also known as

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,520
vk intel on twitter

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,920
uh my talk it's basically i wanted to

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,520
talk about the

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,119
the north korean group lazarus

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,880
intersection between trigbat

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,279
i also want to dive deeper into the

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,880
evolutions of crimeware

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,039
intent or criminal intent and how we can

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,440
use some of the adversary knowledge we

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,399
know for

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,320
hunting and some of the use case i

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,399
wanted to show you and demonstrate

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,160
it's one of my favorite tools of course

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,160
yara signature so we'll

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,039
quickly walk through how knowing

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,760
specific

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,399
aspects about yara and maybe helping

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,360
explaining one

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,000
unique angle across the er signature

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
development that you can use in your

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
day-to-day activities that produces high

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,039
fidelity results

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,640
so okay let's start so the talk

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,120
outline we'll talk uh in the beginning

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,879
we'll talk about the crime where intent

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,720
evolutions of criminal intent

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,080
will go back into uh the financially

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
motivated beginnings of malware

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
writers and what they were pursuing

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,479
we'll talk more about

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,880
how the current trends across the

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,240
malware landscape

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,040
and what the current aspects of malware

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,920
developers

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,560
and malware attackers and ap advanced

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,159
persistent threat groups and crammer

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:28,640
groups

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,400
what do they realize how do they search

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,119
for the targets of interest to them

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,720
and some of the ancient things that came

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,640
out of that of course you will see

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
it will will again will just decide

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,119
network parsing and active directory

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,399
exploitation

49
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,799
and then uh the apt approach and

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,840
ransomware

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
and it's kind of like um seamless

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,240
interactions currently beginning to

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,040
happen

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
as we know that ept approaches to the

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,560
advanced persistent threat

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
it seems to be very targeted in many

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,759
cases

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,479
and ransomware becomes the uh the flavor

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,200
of the day

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,479
we'll talk about that quickly or

61
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,240
emergence of ransom hacks

62
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,759
and then uh through that approach we'll

63
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,520
also talk about the net trigbot

64
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,080
before that and lazarus we'll talk about

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,720
unique

66
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,680
aspects that make uh make it more

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,440
interesting it's the yara hunting for

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,959
crypto implementations

69
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,879
i am a strong deliverer in yara as a

70
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
tool for day-to-day activities across

71
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,879
the enterprises and networks and

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,800
security

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,840
security products and something that

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920
will show you an example of uh

75
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
one specific the three but crypter used

76
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
across the anchor and many many other

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,519
projects that will

78
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,360
go over to the stations and how we can

79
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
go

80
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,360
write a quick but good and sound yara

81
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,560
hunting rule for

82
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,319
looking for crypto implementation within

83
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,680
the malware because that's the future

84
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,040
who am i my name is vitalik kramez i'm

85
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
uh um i'm pretty well known on twitter

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,280
land i previously work in the

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,319
uh for the you know in the us uh as a

88
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
prosecutor's office i used to hunt

89
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
cybercrime for

90
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,319
for a living working for kevin helping

91
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,840
prosecute some of the most

92
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,319
sophisticated and technically savvy

93
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,120
groups

94
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,239
um my work was focused on around taking

95
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,120
down big

96
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,920
big crime work gangs and crime war

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,640
groups

98
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,440
and again of course those they had

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
nation state component as well

100
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,360
so my work related to the government

101
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
work led to my private industry work and

102
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,400
of course

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
one of the interesting things that

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
stands out about me is that

105
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
one time of course the apt-28 group as

106
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,120
we know

107
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,239
that belief to be targeting uh literally

108
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,840
to be breached actually the democratic

109
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,440
national committee in the u.s

110
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,840
uh that the same entity actually left my

111
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,760
name uh in the malware after my blog

112
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,720
went live so

113
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,239
it's a kind of like a tribute to the

114
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,640
malware and if you follow me on twitter

115
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,920
feel free to follow me vk

116
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,840
intel my personal blog where i write

117
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
quite a bit on

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,040
deeper like malware reversing topics

119
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,480
some of them are more technical but

120
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,799
they're

121
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,080
more technical on purpose um

122
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,159
yeah so let's dive deeper into that

123
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,080
so the cyber crime trends of 2020 what

124
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,640
do we see

125
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,840
currently on the um on the landscape

126
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,159
is that the sophisticated criminal

127
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,280
enterprises

128
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
some of the most sophisticated currently

129
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,199
are ongoing is trig but quackbot

130
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,720
and of course ta505 they are all focused

131
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,440
on parsing

132
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
identifying high-value targets actually

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
you can include z-loader as well

134
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
as they also look for those machines

135
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,639
with local domains and those machines

136
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,440
that have

137
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,560
rich networks it's also the cybercrime

138
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,840
meets apt

139
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
where they no longer rely simply on

140
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,080
fully automated approach

141
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
where they would basically uh extract

142
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
the value from the bots

143
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,240
and and automatically launch and kind of

144
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,960
search for them

145
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,080
but they hire crew of people and network

146
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,600
um operators used to be

147
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,199
quite some time ago used to be the fraud

148
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,800
operators used to be the highest

149
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
value addition for the malware groups

150
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
but now it seems to be both

151
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,320
fraud operations and network

152
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,720
exploitations and ransom hacks

153
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,840
become also important as they used to

154
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
amplify extortions

155
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,199
and it's kind of like lead to public

156
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,720
disclosures and

157
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
and some of the groups that also work

158
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
with apts for example

159
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,240
we know for a fact that our evil works

160
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
with the fin7

161
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,000
group of course he um share you some

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,400
snippets on that as well but also we

163
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,960
know that

164
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
some groups also including lazarus

165
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
previously used some ransomware is

166
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,800
either for cover-up or additional

167
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
financial gain

168
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,360
so these are interesting aspects of um

169
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
and almost all the majority ransomware

170
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,440
groups actually i believe

171
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,759
the almost all of them are becoming

172
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,960
ransom hacks

173
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,600
where they deploy a website and threaten

174
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,160
to leak

175
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
the data if it's not being paid it's a

176
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
pretty clever way of uh

177
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
monetizing maybe predicted before that

178
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
all the groups will be doing

179
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
similar activities across the landscape

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,880
so big

181
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,960
big data collectors necessity scalable

182
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,120
solutions to identify high value targets

183
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,800
it's corporate networks with local

184
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,440
domain so some of mine uh my machines

185
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
may not be as use as useful

186
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
as the corporate infection of course

187
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,639
especially now with the kernel of irs

188
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,840
what they look for

189
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,520
those that are connected to networks and

190
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,759
those that have remote services

191
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,560
available

192
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
including the rdps citrix vpns for

193
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,240
example etc

194
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
and the idea is just to squeeze more

195
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,479
value dollars pounds euros

196
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,560
from the bots as possible so they deploy

197
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,160
different kinds of

198
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,400
operations the banking malware they have

199
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,479
a crew that monetizes that credential

200
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,639
stealers of course miners and ransomware

201
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,199
the key component or the father of

202
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,479
crimeware and it's

203
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,800
why this person is so impactful to this

204
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,840
to the talk we have

205
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,880
because he the person who

206
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,960
professionalized

207
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,440
the approach of targeting the approach

208
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,800
of essentially

209
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,599
um developing new novel methods and

210
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,800
scaling them to

211
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
perfection so the slavic essentially

212
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
that led

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,759
of course the business club and before

214
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,759
that he built the kind of hybrid attack

215
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,560
model

216
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,319
or uh they used they used basically

217
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
an automation attack where they would

218
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,240
deploy uh

219
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
malware but also they were considering

220
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
well they had the fraud operation as

221
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,919
well

222
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,599
this was known to be the business club

223
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,039
but also business club introduced the

224
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,639
crypto locker which is the first

225
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,440
ransomware

226
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,919
and some of the uh operators that we

227
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,360
were talking through the presentation

228
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
especially those connected to lazarus

229
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,280
groups

230
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
are also also interconnected and going

231
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,720
back to

232
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,840
the models and frameworks that slavic

233
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,080
developed when he was uh when he was

234
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,840
running the business

235
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
so the idea is why and what the top

236
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
sophisticated crimeware and apt groups

237
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,080
do they hunt for

238
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,160
those machines that have network records

239
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,440
and those are

240
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,199
those machines are deemed to be high

241
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,280
value targets outside of the direct

242
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,360
targeting that they might have through

243
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
uh direct specification

244
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,639
or direct targeting by other means so

245
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,000
one of the interesting things of course

246
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,720
that uh that the the key component now

247
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,560
which is super popular is that the

248
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,919
automated malware

249
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
where they deploy a kind of an image for

250
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
example is a typical

251
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,919
loader for trigbot or a trigger on its

252
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,759
own so it's pretty equal

253
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
where the deployed by you can now of

254
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,199
course quantity

255
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,840
ran somewhere county ransomware is the

256
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,199
substitutional right

257
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
but the method and methodology and

258
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
and everything works the same except now

259
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,759
they have a leak website actually

260
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,560
where the extort victims but the way

261
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,639
they differentiate across the spectrum

262
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,320
of infections is through network and

263
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
active directory person

264
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
yes there seems to be a problem with

265
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,880
slides they are not moving we are stuck

266
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,958
on the we're stuck on the initial slide

267
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,039
for a long time

268
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,320
okay one second right now we are at the

269
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,800
automated malware plus interactive human

270
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,320
exploitation operator slide

271
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,839
okay one second yes

272
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,959
can you see the slides again yes i can

273
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,240
see it and we are

274
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,120
the slide with yeah the automated

275
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,839
malware slide

276
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,040
okay i was going with

277
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,760
and then after

278
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,959
after basically the network and active

279
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,240
directory parsing

280
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
they oftentimes deploy the powershell

281
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
empire and cobalt strike beacons

282
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,040
and use it for network network and

283
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
active directory parsing

284
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
one of the interesting aspects of course

285
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,120
uh just to share with you some of the

286
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,880
incidents we've seen across the trigbot

287
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,040
installation that of course the cobalt

288
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,640
strike and interpreter

289
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,200
load loads basically this is some of the

290
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,279
images from the attacker side

291
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,200
and and why it's so important for them

292
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,399
to target them

293
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
so it's it's the view once they're

294
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
infected oftentimes they deploy a cobalt

295
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,080
strike

296
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
through the powershell tasking of the

297
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,480
bot or the interpreter itself

298
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,560
as you can see in the slides this is

299
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
kind of the adversary view

300
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,800
on the malware and botnets on their own

301
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,959
once they are infected

302
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,720
as you can see they're looking for the

303
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,279
admin credentials and exchanging and

304
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,279
harvesting credentials using for example

305
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
ps exact to spread

306
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,440
etc but this is the beacon tasking and

307
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,399
an armitage

308
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,760
for the cobalt strike beacon as well

309
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,959
so one of the ancient aspects of course

310
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,079
that why so becomes such a big issue on

311
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,079
the horizon from the malware side

312
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,800
is the 5 billion extortion amount if

313
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
that's what the extortion amount that

314
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,079
the groups asked earlier

315
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,720
uh essentially once they infect the

316
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,920
cloud jumper

317
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,880
which is the huge uh msp msp provider

318
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,640
essentially providing the

319
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,399
access to many active directory

320
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,399
installations and many many other

321
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,800
components across customer interfaces

322
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
and across the interface they infected

323
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,959
one of the of course most notable

324
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,880
infections was the la times

325
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,120
los angeles times one was infected and

326
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,320
it was a huge debate

327
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,800
if lazarus was inside the tree by the

328
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,760
tree but it was

329
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,000
part of lazarus because because they

330
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,279
also found that

331
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,440
the hermes ransomware was potentially

332
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,320
deployed or

333
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,600
in that case everybody thought it was

334
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
hormone hermes but it was in fact ryuk

335
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
which was the ransomware used by trigbat

336
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
and of course they'll show the direct

337
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,519
intersection between those groups

338
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,120
but this was a pretty interesting and

339
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,760
novel component when they realized

340
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,000
instead of like squeezing bots through

341
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,160
credentials activities and they can ask

342
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
for a lot of money in cryptocurrency

343
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,880
and launder them pretty safely and the

344
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
way it allows them to enable to do that

345
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
it's through the of course having a

346
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
steady flow of new bots

347
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,519
having steady flow of new corporate bots

348
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,720
or infections that have

349
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,959
the most impact and interacting them

350
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,000
with ransomware

351
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,200
and it was also sorry to

352
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,800
sorry to interrupt you once again i'm

353
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
sorry about it but the chat says that

354
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,120
you are probably shooting the wrong

355
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
screen

356
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,000
instead of the one with the actual

357
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
presentation you are sharing the one

358
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
with

359
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,519
earlier that that's the case brought so

360
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,800
much notoriety

361
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,040
to the ransomware target ransomware

362
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,120
approach where they realized the value

363
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,959
of having a targeted

364
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,760
team of exploitation operators to staff

365
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,079
their

366
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,560
bots will be extremely successful as you

367
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
can see the amount and extortions were

368
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,200
over

369
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,760
60 600 000 bitcoins across their

370
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
customer interface

371
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
but this is of course more than five

372
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,959
billion dollars in

373
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
in bitcoins if after conversions now so

374
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
it's pretty huge huge amount

375
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
and hugely profitable and that's

376
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,440
something that they also noted

377
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,880
and also like just to give a quick

378
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
survey of some of the interesting groups

379
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,639
we've seen as well that utilize the kind

380
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,000
of advanced persistent threat

381
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,720
angle as we talked about that the new

382
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,600
flavor of them

383
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
that network park sync for high value

384
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,519
targets or we can also call it

385
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,560
the apt or crime where meet uh

386
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
the criminal groups become apt groups

387
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
advanced versus persistent groups

388
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,000
they approach they adapt the same

389
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,760
approach as you can see here

390
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,639
doppelganger

391
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,399
it's when when they were engaged in the

392
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,399
pam extrusion of course i'm showing the

393
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,920
debugging window

394
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
and that's where the they were

395
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,959
essentially attacking and extorting over

396
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,000
565 bitcoins

397
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
with again with the leak and extortion

398
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,240
portal in on their website

399
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,480
and this is just kind of another

400
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,079
ransomware that also engage

401
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,240
ransomware group also linked to evil

402
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,959
corp also behind drydex also linked to

403
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,720
slavic and this is kind of like the um

404
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,320
the genealogy or like the uh the tree of

405
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
crime where oftentimes uh comes back to

406
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,680
slavic

407
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
as a person because the groups also were

408
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
at one point in time their customers

409
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,360
this is the group that was also doing

410
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,839
the same advanced visit thread groups

411
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,680
once they're on the networks

412
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,199
another interesting group of course is

413
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,000
that the tta 505 favorite oftentimes we

414
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,959
are

415
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,880
asked what's the ransomware they

416
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,199
deployed and that's the one that we so

417
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,560
continuously

418
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,120
deployed across their targets after

419
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
extensive network

420
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,959
profile and operation deployed by them

421
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,480
where they would essentially run a task

422
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
and look for the bots with

423
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,360
the network records and you can see that

424
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,959
that the group is linked to university

425
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,120
hostel friends attack

426
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,440
and then of course very targeted not

427
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
every bot would receive

428
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,199
the club rent somewhere but those are

429
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,480
those that have the

430
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,320
network records those the boss they have

431
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,920
breach access to

432
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,079
the network environment or local domain

433
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,600
and active directory

434
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,279
those are the ones that are especially

435
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,199
targeted and you can see this just an

436
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,320
example of

437
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,920
of the one that we are conclusively

438
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
linked to the ta-505

439
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,839
so almost all the groups now have some

440
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,600
sort of like

441
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
a unique flavor of ransomware adopting

442
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,279
pretty similar approaches where they use

443
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,839
their own infection as a basis they

444
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,639
deploy

445
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,040
or hire people to staff their infections

446
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,639
to be the exploit operators

447
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,560
what they would for example open a

448
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
connections via what they would ask

449
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
hey can you download and install

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,760
additional tool on the bots or

451
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
additional toolkit

452
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
asking to back connect to the bot for

453
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,360
example open up the powershell task and

454
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,000
download for example powershell empire

455
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,360
or global strike

456
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,880
oftentimes they are operating very

457
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
similarly some of the

458
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,880
exploitation operators also are shared

459
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,639
across the groups so that's why you also

460
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,920
see similar ttps

461
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
they also rely on open source tools or

462
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,839
or those tools that are already used by

463
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,920
penetration testing teams

464
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,199
across the across the corporate networks

465
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,279
so something you can always see across

466
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,839
the environments that they are no longer

467
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,680
having exclusive provider software but

468
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,279
also use

469
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,759
uh the open source software and the way

470
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,279
that actually once the access to

471
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,639
corporate network is secured or

472
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,160
government network

473
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,880
the two things can happen as we've seen

474
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,680
that the

475
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,759
different the access is sold as a

476
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,680
commodity but also offered as a service

477
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,519
to different sophisticated groups

478
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,360
and that's how we came across the

479
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
lazarus infections

480
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
and some of the most interesting some of

481
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
the most prolific

482
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
and highly regarded infections that

483
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,839
we've seen are those that of course as

484
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,880
we mentioned earlier

485
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,279
have rich network records those that

486
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,040
have big corporate environments that can

487
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
be infected

488
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,399
or exported in some other ways but also

489
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
offered as a service by trusted

490
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,399
relationship between those groups

491
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,720
so they can also be sold directly on the

492
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,639
various underground forums

493
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,959
as if you know like uh so the access can

494
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,160
be commodity

495
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,279
uh as an open like auction style forum

496
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,040
if the network access is not sold

497
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,639
oftentimes it's provided by

498
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,160
different other actors to to look for

499
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,639
specific files or databases or run

500
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,120
specific urls across their botnet

501
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,520
oftentimes the access is used as a

502
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,119
service of course where they take

503
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,679
part in the profit sharing model of once

504
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,559
they monetize

505
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,480
the for example ransomware so they can

506
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
be a percentage of the fee

507
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,799
when one state once they exploit basic

508
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,640
land and secure payment from the victim

509
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,199
so just

510
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,199
different profit sharing models that

511
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,720
we've seen in the

512
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,679
underground landscape

513
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,120
again just to uh two three ideas

514
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
direct dark web sales we've seen

515
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
financial data manipulations for example

516
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,320
one stock trading some of the groups

517
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,720
also sophisticated apt groups do that

518
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
and we sell to malware teams or those

519
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,120
teams that are exploitation teams

520
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
that are um those are the ones that

521
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,200
would deploy a cobalt strike as we

522
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,960
showed earlier or interpreter

523
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,039
and use different specific toolkits to

524
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,880
either move the cross laterally to

525
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,600
network

526
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,480
or target for example point of sale

527
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,280
terminals

528
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,280
or deploy ransomware directly

529
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,080
so what's the unique things and we'll as

530
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,280
we talk through the

531
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,880
can advanced piston thread approach and

532
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
ransomware and trig button lazarus and

533
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,600
how does he

534
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
connect so trigbot just to take it one

535
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,600
step back is the

536
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,240
russian-speaking sophisticated crime or

537
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
group that were former customers

538
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,960
where actually comes they do derive back

539
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,919
to dire

540
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,400
and dire with the customers of slavic

541
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
who the person we discussed earlier

542
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,480
the father the godfather of crime where

543
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
if if i can call them that

544
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,559
way and the lazarus is the north korea

545
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,200
pro

546
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,240
uh for profit for profit group that

547
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,000
is believed to be supported by the

548
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
nation state uh government

549
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the task with procuring currency

550
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
bringing back to the north korean regime

551
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
so what do the russians

552
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,480
do with north koreans or what is the

553
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,799
russian group that believe to be

554
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,720
similar gang cyber crime game but

555
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,240
actually they are more than just a game

556
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,679
their sophisticated

557
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,520
criminal enterprise and how do they work

558
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,120
within lazar's group

559
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,559
which is we know it to be the north

560
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,799
korean group so the specific

561
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,480
unique things that we talked about the

562
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,840
trick but enterprise

563
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,000
it's now also no longer that we've seen

564
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760
the groups are

565
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,880
just games as i mentioned or

566
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
or single like as you've seen the the

567
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,360
trig bot has sophisticated operations

568
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,919
that comes from crypto mining ransomware

569
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,600
steelers and bank fraud

570
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
where they deploy different types of

571
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,360
operators to staff it

572
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
uh and ransomware of course right you

573
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,799
and now kante

574
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,799
steelers of course and then crypto

575
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,799
miners and bank fraud

576
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,480
and the idea just to monetize their

577
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
infections

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
and this is used to be and this is kind

579
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
of the core model behind the trick but

580
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,919
dyer and slavic that he developed he

581
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,600
realized that he can squeeze more value

582
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,080
through

583
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
ransomware and then they also do

584
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,080
ransomware now and they operate as a

585
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
professional coded

586
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,400
coding coders actually something that

587
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,320
is pretty actually impressive when you

588
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,240
look at into them

589
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,280
and now the specific intersection

590
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,000
between

591
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
the kind of the crimeware uh an apt

592
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,840
domain

593
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,480
is the kind of the whole the holy grail

594
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,159
of the nexus between the two

595
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,480
was that the specific task you know bots

596
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,919
as i mentioned earlier

597
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,480
two and two waves access to crime crime

598
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,039
net uh

599
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,440
to to to networks procured by criminal

600
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,720
groups or

601
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,280
uh it can be sold to apt groups or

602
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,120
different other crime work groups

603
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,360
it's through access as a service for

604
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,559
example where the

605
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,720
profit share you have a profit sharing

606
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,919
model for example

607
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,559
and if i'm a crimeware or an apt group

608
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,640
and i'm asking them hey can you just

609
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
let me know if you have specific bank

610
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,559
internal access for example

611
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,720
and they would say like yes we do and

612
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,000
then we'll either pay

613
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,559
them a fee for the for example if they

614
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,480
target like point of sale terminals or

615
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,200
systems

616
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,600
behind it they'll just pay a fee steady

617
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,960
fee depending on the relationship or

618
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
sell them as a commodity

619
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
as you can see here the camera domain is

620
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,400
that the steelers fraud

621
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
ransomware network content module

622
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,480
injects password grab module that's the

623
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,880
typical trig bot and the apt domain was

624
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,720
that the anchor project

625
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
the anchor is also a name used within

626
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,320
the trigbot

627
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,919
pdb path loaders or bots itself as you

628
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,679
might see in our blog that we published

629
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,400
with

630
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,520
actually when we discovered with

631
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,000
sentinel labs was that the anchor

632
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
was the that's kind of the flavor of

633
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,799
trigbot almost like a fork

634
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,039
of the core project of trigbot you can

635
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
see that they also derive

636
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,600
the memory scraper point of sale malware

637
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,760
also there is also used exclusively by

638
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,320
the group

639
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,919
there's also anchor bot and then the

640
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,320
unique thing it was the power tank

641
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
that's the tool believed to be uniquely

642
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,240
attributed to lazarus group

643
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,559
it's a powerful version of a tangoba

644
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,720
same malware that used to use actually

645
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,000
targeted the polish central

646
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,120
authority uh bank actually quite some

647
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
time ago when bae

648
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,760
noticed that so they're also kind of

649
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,919
pretty notably attributed to the group

650
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,440
that we were talking about

651
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,880
and the unique aspects that the kind of

652
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,200
is

653
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
just to come back and been home the idea

654
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,960
is that

655
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
once they identify high value targets

656
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,799
there was a trigbot anchor server

657
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,799
that has this task as you can see econ

658
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,080
box store

659
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
with the actions he get passed that was

660
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,320
executed and downloaded and high profile

661
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,600
victim bod

662
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,080
and uh and that was the exact powershell

663
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,280
version of power tank

664
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,600
which is also again uniquely attributed

665
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,400
to the

666
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,080
lazarus group and that's where the

667
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,159
unique nexus is

668
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,159
and that's also led us to believe that

669
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,440
so the groups are also

670
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,000
very connected connected more than just

671
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
uh on the relationship side

672
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,840
they're practically part of the access

673
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,120
as a service model

674
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,960
or for example the group or the person

675
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,799
who actually asked to download power

676
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,520
tangba

677
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,640
on behalf of uh we're assuming

678
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,039
the lazarus group was also very familiar

679
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,919
with the trigbet

680
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,520
operators or might be in very close

681
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,440
proximity and we also know that for

682
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,880
example that north korea also deploys

683
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,559
practices or very connected

684
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,960
to the underground world as it is as

685
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,840
there have been

686
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,159
numerous documented cases of them either

687
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,280
working directly

688
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,880
or sharing bots with also the group

689
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,640
called ta 505

690
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,240
or the trig plot and it's also just to

691
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
show you the example of that as you

692
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
remember earlier i showed you the ecom

693
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,039
backstore

694
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,159
url where the action was again psb

695
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,440
and it was downloaded through on the red

696
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,000
bank

697
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
that the bank in chile uh intrusion and

698
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,360
that was

699
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,240
the part-time but through the fake i

700
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,520
guess resume

701
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,919
application process where some of the

702
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,000
software developers inside the bank

703
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,320
was targeted by the lazarus group by

704
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,440
linkedin apparently

705
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,520
and they spoke on the phone and skype

706
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,200
and actually and they downloaded this

707
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,919
app

708
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,000
as an application it was just to install

709
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,679
and bruce them into

710
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,799
uh direct bank internal installations

711
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,240
but the same url we found in trig

712
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,080
budgets also with one

713
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,880
difference is uh the the one that they

714
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,360
saw

715
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,320
was that a get psb but we also see get

716
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
psb that's a last action

717
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,640
argument used by the same server so

718
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,320
pretty interesting

719
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,000
and uh and that's kind of shows the

720
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,600
unique and first uh

721
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,080
opportunity we saw of the direct link

722
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,279
between uh

723
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,360
first confirmed technical link between

724
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
the trig bot and lazarus it was pretty

725
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,799
exciting when we discovered and continue

726
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,600
to see that

727
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,360
and it kind of highlights this idea the

728
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,039
bot that they actually tasked on was a

729
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,400
high profile victim

730
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,640
and the way they profiled again as we

731
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,279
mentioned is that through network active

732
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,279
network and active directory parsing and

733
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,679
also just trying to identify if

734
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,600
a high value target

735
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,200
i guess the idea is that can also as

736
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
we've seen that are evil and mace for

737
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
example some of the most sophisticated

738
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,039
groups

739
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,559
also become apts on their own

740
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,279
also work with apt for example the our

741
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,679
evo works with fin7 pin 7 supplies some

742
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,360
infections to them

743
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,200
uh and kind of like not infections but

744
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,120
uh pin 7 actually extorts some of the

745
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
companies deploy ransomware as well

746
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,559
because ransomware become very

747
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,559
successful and this is kind of like the

748
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,400
new the flavor of the day where the

749
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,720
crimeware also takes this now the step

750
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,440
model with kind of the merged the ept

751
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,840
group

752
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,200
the advanced percent threat groups and

753
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,440
ransomware and now they're also using

754
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,799
that approach to maximize

755
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,480
publicity as we know we live in the

756
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
world of the social media and

757
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,039
the uh journalism so that's what they

758
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,799
try to do they try to

759
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,559
bring more publicity around breaches and

760
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,480
force some like legal actions and that's

761
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,400
something that

762
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,200
our evil unknown which is the

763
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,159
representative

764
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,240
behind the group that was super

765
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,600
successful currently

766
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
that the successor of the game crab

767
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,880
operations

768
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,120
it also kind of implies that hey if you

769
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,080
do not like

770
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,240
uh reply back or not like really

771
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,080
interested there's a gdpr

772
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,039
of course concerns and then he basically

773
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,440
says

774
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,159
that uh yeah instead of like encrypting

775
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,240
just files they threaten to publish them

776
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,760
and it kind of like becomes the flavor

777
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
whenever you do needs a response work on

778
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,480
ransomware cases

779
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,640
look for evidence of exploration because

780
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,880
that was the key in many cases

781
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,480
they no longer just simply deploy

782
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,120
ransomware and leave but also

783
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,200
find some means and ways and hooks to

784
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,559
download more data

785
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,360
and make it available for for them to

786
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,440
later to extort basically to force

787
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,200
the payment from the victims

788
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,640
so one idea i want to show you and i

789
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,200
want you to

790
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
when you to get out of this talk it's

791
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
also as we talked earlier the whole

792
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,080
evolution chain

793
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,960
from from zeus father of crimeware zoo

794
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,919
slavic

795
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,400
to the trigbot operators working now

796
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,120
with the

797
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,520
uh person or reported like person worked

798
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,320
before who

799
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
is linked with lazarus group through

800
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,400
technical evidence that we saw

801
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,480
uh we also want to find out some unique

802
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,320
yara hunting opportunities for code

803
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,039
reuse

804
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,960
i i definitely believe a huge believer

805
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,480
and the code we use across

806
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,200
the different malware samples is the is

807
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,080
the easiest

808
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
not the easiest rather i would say the

809
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
most successful and the most

810
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,240
highly profitable i guess from from the

811
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,600
hunter side

812
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,919
to to obtain more value is just to look

813
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:00,880
for unique

814
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,200
implementations of code but i want to

815
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,039
like to make you think about even a step

816
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:05,679
further

817
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,840
do not even look for unique uh code

818
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,279
implemented but look for crypto

819
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,320
implementation

820
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,880
or like if there's opportunity to find a

821
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,679
unique

822
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,360
cryptographical implementations in the

823
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,120
mall or just pursue it and write a quick

824
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,000
signature

825
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,120
that's something that i've we've been

826
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,399
doing for quite some time and that's

827
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,840
something that allows us to

828
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,360
even sometimes they convertedly see the

829
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,679
new samples before they getting flagged

830
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,159
or identified by anti-virus engines and

831
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,520
that's something that allows us to be

832
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,399
ahead of them

833
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,480
in many ways it's it feels like a cat

834
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,240
mouse game so from the

835
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,760
malware developer side they try to be

836
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
ahead of the defense

837
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
they want to make sure the code is not

838
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,720
detected or it's

839
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,919
by passes certain av antivirus

840
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,559
detections but also from our side we can

841
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,559
also hunt for the human behavior

842
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,480
which is the unique implementations of

843
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,600
code

844
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,880
so this is kind of like it's also kind

845
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,799
of leads to unique positive

846
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
issue things like that like reducing our

847
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,640
workload and allows us to have high

848
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,600
fidelity

849
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,200
uh long standing rules across across our

850
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
signatures

851
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
and this is an example of has been

852
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,600
tracking this is the trigbot loader

853
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
this is the one that has the typical

854
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,880
custom crypter

855
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,880
with the unique rc4 key implementations

856
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,279
as that we've been tracking since 2019

857
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,720
and the way we can actually we're

858
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,360
tracking

859
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
through that specific group through

860
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,720
unique character

861
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,000
and as we talked about the trigger

862
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,679
button is linking to anchor and anchors

863
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,600
also was used in the same

864
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
cryptic before as well as the ryuk and

865
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,640
now kante

866
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,559
and also imitation was using similar

867
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,840
crypter but there's a

868
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,919
huge opportunity for us for defense

869
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,480
knowing what their evolution is knowing

870
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,120
what their

871
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,520
behavior is and focusing on them allows

872
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,039
us to identify unique

873
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,679
yara signature opportunities and this is

874
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,039
an example where the

875
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,960
trigbull utilized its own unique

876
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,240
encryption service

877
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,520
for some time and now it's been

878
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
frequently updated and the latest

879
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
versions also kind of uses the kind of

880
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
rc4 with the twist

881
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,919
and it's kind of like a key aspect of

882
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,520
learning the adversary behaviors and

883
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,240
applying

884
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,840
the our intelligence hat and our

885
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,440
intelligence knowledge to the technical

886
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,159
domain

887
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,000
it's a perfect opportunity to write a

888
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,760
simple and packer and at the same time

889
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,399
to force analyze a modified routine this

890
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,600
is kind of like on the bottom

891
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,360
you'll see it's going to slightly change

892
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,640
a changed s

893
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,640
box size of the the rc4

894
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,039
key the unique implementations that we

895
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,399
saw across the malware

896
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,960
including including all the loaders that

897
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
precursors to lazarus that we saw

898
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,760
earlier and

899
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
actually going forward even of course

900
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,600
going forward that's the future

901
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,919
we're looking into that's the unique

902
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,440
what they actually added the ror

903
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,320
13 api hash and now they have rc4 key

904
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,520
with null terminator and s

905
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,320
box size you see s bucket size is very

906
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,200
non-typical

907
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,320
for rc4 it's not the usual size

908
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,559
it's actually 184 so like

909
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,799
as you can see those who track the crypt

910
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,240
implementation that kind of be super

911
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,880
valuable

912
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,480
once you see uniquely uh changed

913
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,279
the uh rc4 key and oftentimes when

914
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,640
you're looking to try to develop

915
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,600
automation tools

916
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,200
allow you to have advanced visibility

917
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,960
into malware oftentimes you can be

918
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,520
questions of

919
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,320
why why my rc4 doesn't work especially

920
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,159
after recognizing the same as boxes you

921
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,039
see here

922
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,080
and cache rotating uh kind of you and

923
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,399
this

924
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,919
the reason why it's that they slightly

925
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,840
altered it to make it less

926
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,120
uh less easy or uh

927
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,840
for for defense to essentially obtain uh

928
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,520
information about the bot

929
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,279
and this is the key there it's an

930
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,880
example of how you can

931
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,960
search for this is this is just looking

932
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,480
for the unique snippets

933
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,919
the unique snippets as i mentioned

934
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,760
actually in tweet as well as you can see

935
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,559
this unique

936
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,600
key they used uh

937
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
oftentimes that's used actually within

938
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,880
the stop of a crypter

939
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,120
and stub it's basically the program that

940
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,880
used to kind of like uh

941
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,919
to decrypt uh and essentially run the

942
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:56,799
crypto itself

943
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,840
and uh and impact the core binary of its

944
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,720
own

945
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,399
just kind of the terminology across of

946
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,720
it and and it kind of like remains

947
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,559
sim somewhat consistent as you can see

948
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,159
the snippet of this

949
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,480
oftentimes when you look into um ida pro

950
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,080
i recommend to turn on the um

951
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,799
these essentially to the up codes to see

952
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,080
what the up codes because of that my

953
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,600
right signature is off the op codes as

954
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,039
you can see on the left side

955
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,159
and snippets will have certain

956
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,000
components of course you can wild card

957
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,880
certain bytes

958
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,279
especially those can be changed and and

959
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,960
provide opportunity to those that be

960
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,840
flexible

961
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,760
and the s box size as you can see that's

962
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,840
something super notable

963
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,760
for us to track but something that's

964
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,200
again unique opportunity

965
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,760
here that the xbox size does not account

966
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,200
for 184 but

967
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,080
uh but this is just a unique example

968
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,840
across the samples as you can see

969
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,360
two aspects of the signature can be used

970
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,559
is that the snippet of the key component

971
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,039
and then

972
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,360
again we are tracking the packed malware

973
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,559
uh so

974
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,240
pretty interesting and kind of like

975
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,480
ahead of the thread and then the s-box

976
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,840
and that's what the unique

977
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,200
um trigbot s-box rc 4k implementation

978
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,640
the condition of course the snippet and

979
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,840
xbox size

980
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,159
just uh for those who are into writing

981
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,440
the art centers that's something the

982
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,159
unique

983
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,679
unique crypt implementations in the

984
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,200
malware that we were just talking

985
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,679
through

986
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,960
allows us to have uh future visions into

987
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,720
what they've been doing and what's the

988
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,360
new state of malware

989
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,200
and then of course you can use unique

990
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,640
different things and look for

991
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,200
yara scan for example custom as box and

992
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,760
key for

993
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,320
automated static unpacker and scripting

994
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,120
or you you

995
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,039
utilizing a reliant on certain sandbox

996
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,120
feature so there's a huge and

997
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,039
rich opportunities for you to learn and

998
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,559
kind of like apply your knowledge on the

999
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,120
technical

1000
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,279
side and then essentially write this

1001
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,159
simple or

1002
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,399
not simple to simple static and packers

1003
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,399
so i want to talk and kind of like give

1004
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,919
you a few takeaways

1005
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,080
of from the presentations and talk about

1006
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,240
what the unique things and uh

1007
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,399
of course beyond even uh the truth but

1008
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,240
anchor and the evidence that we showed

1009
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,960
earlier

1010
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,039
is that the new kind of flavor of the

1011
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,600
day is that the automations in malware

1012
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,720
approach to spam it's it's no longer

1013
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,679
just the span

1014
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,399
it's no longer just the financial fraud

1015
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,080
exploitations that we saw that they

1016
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,799
deploy

1017
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,440
network exploitation operators to staff

1018
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,399
their infections

1019
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,320
there's a convergence of apt in crime or

1020
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,679
as we talked earlier

1021
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,960
is that the network access or the bot

1022
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,159
access is sold as an access as a service

1023
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,360
or access as a one one opportunity right

1024
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,279
so like access is a commodity

1025
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,559
so there's a different ways and

1026
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,399
different means and methods how does

1027
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,440
crimeware and ebt

1028
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,880
groups especially in a financially

1029
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,720
motivated side and those are they

1030
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
actually work with apt groups for

1031
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,000
electric bot and

1032
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,360
uh for example that's one of the

1033
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,240
evidence of uh the lazarus group

1034
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,840
and that was kind of the hidden nexus

1035
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,279
between those groups and that's how they

1036
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,080
work and

1037
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,840
once they trigger an inc identified high

1038
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,760
value target and they're in close

1039
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,679
contact with the person who works or

1040
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,120
affiliated with

1041
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,679
the group as known to be a lazarus north

1042
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,600
korean state sponsor group they would

1043
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,840
ask them to download a task and profile

1044
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,799
the machine

1045
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,960
or doing something similar to that

1046
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,719
extent whatever they would do

1047
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,639
and the way that we do it through for

1048
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,159
example this was the powershell or

1049
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,760
actually download and execute

1050
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,079
type of task and this is kind of the new

1051
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,800
flavor or rather the trend the trending

1052
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,079
flavor of the day

1053
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,320
where the cyber crime meets apt

1054
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,520
especially on the

1055
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,918
ransomware side where after successful

1056
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,520
network

1057
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,679
exploitation operations after they steal

1058
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,719
all the databases

1059
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,119
all and squeeze the value from the

1060
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,399
financial direct flow

1061
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,560
fraud exploitations that would

1062
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,320
essentially use the

1063
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,960
uh to essentially use it for ransomware

1064
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,239
as ransomware

1065
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,000
to be highly profitable in other ways

1066
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,679
not only use a ransomware but also

1067
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,560
you used ransom hacks so connect the

1068
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,040
data

1069
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,760
and then extort the victims publicly so

1070
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,839
make sure the news can cover the stories

1071
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,760
and journalists can report on them and

1072
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,520
of course enforce more pressure to the

1073
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,880
board to comply with the

1074
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
cyber crime demands and one of the

1075
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,079
interesting things across

1076
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,800
all of them i want to like get away with

1077
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,520
the kind of

1078
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,000
quick tips and quick idea behind the

1079
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
presentations as to how to use the yara

1080
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,839
which is a signature matching tool

1081
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,040
and just looking for the malware

1082
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,520
developers and the way to look for our

1083
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,280
developers for unique cryptologic

1084
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,400
implementations

1085
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,440
so the logical keys are the future the

1086
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,160
logical keys provide the highest value

1087
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,359
add for for us and also

1088
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,280
and i think it's also very efficient way

1089
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,560
of going forward

1090
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,000
because oftentimes the stream match is

1091
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
not enough or even the code we use

1092
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,440
does not mean meet the demand of hunters

1093
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
to search across the new and emerging

1094
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,119
malware threats

1095
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,000
and uh so yeah the idea is to hunt for

1096
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
decryptive logic implementations

1097
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,520
so on this note i would like to thank

1098
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,200
you for attending

1099
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,960
my online virtual talk i would love to

1100
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
be in person but this year is a special

1101
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,240
year for many of us

1102
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,680
please feel free to reach out if you

1103
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,599
have any questions and

1104
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,720
i'm passing the microphone back to the

1105
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,280
organizers

1106
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,359
you
