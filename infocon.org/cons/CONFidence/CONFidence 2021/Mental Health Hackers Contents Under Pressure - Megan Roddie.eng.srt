6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,760
as much time to the topic uh i'm not

7

online if you really want to know more

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,720
about me but we're going to go ahead and

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,439
dive right in um so this talk was

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,960
actually um developed by infosister

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,520
amanda berlin who i'll talk about um a

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
bit more later she's the ceo of mental

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,040
health hackers

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,960
and a few years ago she started talking

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,040
about mental health in the community

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
it's grown a lot a topic more people are

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,399
comfortable with

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,399
and as you'll see later is blossomed

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,399
into so much more with mental health

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,879
hackers

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
so the reason this talk is called

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,760
contents under pressure it's kind of

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,640
it's a very intense talk um it's a talk

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,440
that does make some people uncomfortable

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,199
but the point of mental health hackers

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,600
and giving this talk is that even if

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
it's uncomfortable to talk about it's

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,479
something we need to talk about so this

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,960
talk has been given a bunch of times

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,040
i've given about three different

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,439
versions of mental health

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,560
related talks mine is more focused on

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,640
the skill sets that come from

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
neurodiverse

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,360
people

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,479
and

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,840
how it can be leveraged and infosec

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,799
so

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,520
um again my my talks typically cover

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,600
that focus but here we're gonna get into

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,280
the deeper talk of um

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
why why this is important to talk about

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
the uncomfortable topics that often um

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,759
either have stigmas associated with them

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,520
or aren't talked about for

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,280
uh much

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
so

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,719
uh starting off uh we'll talk about the

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,759
fact that

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,439
everybody

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,280
no matter your walk of life no matter

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,840
where you are no matter your history

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,878
probably has uh

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,520
some sort of issue something they are

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
dealing with

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
so

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,840
depression is a big one it's the leasing

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,319
cause for physical illnesses typically

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,160
depression leads to other side effects

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,760
that cause issues

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,640
um

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
so

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,000
i think it's important that

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,520
uh

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,760
we we always talk about these things and

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
bring it up instead of lay it down

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,680
because the more we talk about it the

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,959
more

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,440
ways we can come up with solutions and

71
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,200
the more we can help people in our

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,720
community our family our friends

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,840
so what are some of the things we're

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
dealing with um when we talk about

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
mental health there's a lot of common

76
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,760
disorders associated

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,599
so i'll touch a little bit on some of

78
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,599
them coming up but we talk about things

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,360
like adhd anxiety autism bipolar

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,400
disorder depression ocd schizophrenia

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,599
gets affective disorder

82
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,760
we also sometimes talk about imposter

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,000
syndrome in infosec and it's actually

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,959
now

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,519
listed as

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,239
a

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,959
occupational phenomenon in the

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
international classification of diseases

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
but since it's not classified as a

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,519
medical condition we're not going to

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,519
talk about it much today um there's

92
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,120
plenty of talks

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,680
about uh impostor

94
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,200
syndrome out there now a lot of people

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,560
are talking about it

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
but diving into more of the mental

97
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,480
health disorders side

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,319
we're going to start with

99
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,640
a bipolar disorder

100
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,879
so this was previously known as manic

101
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,640
depression

102
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,799
when bipolar people experience mania um

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,760
they'll

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,959
usually be upbeat jumpy wired

105
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,319
have increased energy and activity

106
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
and euphoria but

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,920
the issue with this uh is typically that

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,599
euphoria can lead to poor

109
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
decision-making rush decisions um so

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,680
even even the good side of things comes

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,400
with a bad side and then obviously the

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,959
other side the depression side

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,600
you'll see a lot of things related to

114
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,800
chronic depression which we'll talk

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,520
about next

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,880
so depression um a lot of time the

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,360
stigma is uh

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,520
you're just sad um

119
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,400
and

120
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,880
that's a really

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,120
not great stigma to put out there um

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,759
because depression is so much more

123
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,360
especially people who are chronically

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,759
depressed um it's a real mental health

125
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,880
issue and not just a i'm sad and

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
you know the response of well life is

127
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
great you should be happy

128
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,800
when you're experiencing depression

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,360
you're gonna have feelings of

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,919
sadness emptiness hopelessness you may

131
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
have angry outbursts over the small

132
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,080
things

133
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,120
um

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
loss of interest in things that you you

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360
typically love hobbies

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,560
and uh also insomnia you have sleep

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,199
issues or you may sleep too much you may

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,520
have sleep disturbances so that's

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,039
obviously going to impact your

140
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,560
day-to-day life

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
if you're not getting your right sleep

142
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,440
anxiety is another big topic to talk

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,160
about there's social or general anxiety

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
disorders

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,720
typically you'll have struggles talking

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,600
or interacting with strangers

147
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,639
you may

148
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,400
be worried about things that may cause

149
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,840
embarrassment

150
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,680
and this will lead you to avoid doing

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,919
things or speaking to people

152
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,000
because of that fear of embarrassment

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,759
you might avoid situations where you

154
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,240
have to interact with strangers so again

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
it can have a huge impact um on your

156
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,440
day-to-day uh interactions and

157
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,360
functioning

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,720
and that's just uh the top three most

159
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
common mental health disorders like i

160
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,840
said you got autism ocd schizoaffective

161
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,360
and so many more

162
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,479
um

163
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,800
so a lot of times these are seen

164
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,960
compounded together for example you'll

165
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
see people who have anxiety and

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,199
depression or adhd and anxiety

167
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,400
lots of overlaps

168
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
so

169
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
there's symptoms and there's signs signs

170
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,199
are what other people can see and

171
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,440
symptoms are what the person feels and

172
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,319
how they respond to how they're feeling

173
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,400
one thing to remember about that

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,440
is especially with the stigmas out there

175
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,039
a lot of people with mental health

176
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,800
disorders um

177
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,680
learn to uh with autism we call it

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,880
masking so um for example i'm autistic

179
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
but younger i learned kind of the

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,440
judgment and the way culture would treat

181
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,680
me when they see certain things um and

182
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
i'm learning not to mask as more now but

183
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,479
i have years of kind of

184
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,800
hiding all those um symptoms um from the

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
world so that they can't see all my

186
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,160
issues

187
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,360
and that's why a lot of people be like

188
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,440
oh i never knew and i was like because

189
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,639
i've learned that i'll be judged so

190
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,560
there's no signs even though there's

191
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
symptoms

192
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,520
so

193
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
these aren't just things that

194
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
a few of us are experiencing the reason

195
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,639
that we've brought it to the community

196
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,960
and started these discussions is how

197
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
widespread

198
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,639
mental health issues are

199
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,280
one in five adults experience a mental

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
health condition every year whatever

201
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
that may be

202
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,599
and one in 17 experience a serious

203
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,599
mental health illness schizophrenia

204
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,840
bipolar more

205
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,879
um

206
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,879
and half of mental health conditions

207
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,360
begin at age 15 14 and then uh

208
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,960
as you get older by 24 you're likely um

209
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
if you're going to develop one habit

210
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,639
uh develop

211
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,440
so

212
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,960
um

213
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,160
one of uh one of the ways amanda

214
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,960
described it is the behavior change info

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
sister the behavior chains and the

216
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
personality changes that come with

217
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
health mental health conditions

218
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
uh

219
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,319
it's like a teenager hitting puberty but

220
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,039
randomly for the rest of your life

221
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,680
so if you think of it that way

222
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,720
it can be so rough

223
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,799
so we you probably a lot of you have

224
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,120
seen the semicolon used related to

225
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,279
mental health especially depression and

226
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,479
suicide

227
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,519
um so we bring it up briefly just so you

228
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,000
guys know actually our part of our logo

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
for the mental health hackers

230
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
incorporates that semicolon um because

231
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,760
we

232
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,399
we got to it represents that uh

233
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,680
a person could have chosen to and their

234
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,959
life as a

235
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,880
author has could have chosen to end

236
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,240
their sentence but chosen not to

237
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
uh

238
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
so

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
uh yeah and and we've

240
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,920
if you uh look at the statistics for

241
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,600
suicide

242
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,320
a

243
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,760
2006 study actually said that of 26 000

244
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
college students over half of them

245
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,399
considered suicide at one point

246
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,399
so this isn't just something affecting a

247
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,200
small population it's a common

248
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
thought that many people experience at

249
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
some point in their lifetime

250
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
it's uh unfortunate that

251
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,760
the cyber security community you may

252
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,560
have seen on twitter uh there's a lot of

253
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,240
threats of suicide online um there's

254
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,160
a lot of people we've lost to suicide um

255
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
infosister when she started talking

256
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,240
about this um part of the reason was

257
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,959
because at least five people in her life

258
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,959
she met have died by suicide um so

259
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,880
it's important that we

260
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
bring support to the community um so

261
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
that

262
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
we

263
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
uh

264
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
we can support each other and reduce the

265
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,480
chances of this happening to our friends

266
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
and family and co-workers

267
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
and i just want to quickly brief bring

268
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
up the difference between um active

269
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,839
suicidal thoughts and passive suicidal

270
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:24,880
thoughts so

271
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,040
um an active suicidal thought is

272
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,120
bringing in that plan there's a plan it

273
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,519
may be vague um but there there is a

274
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,120
very big chance the person um is really

275
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,360
thinking about carrying this out um and

276
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,600
then there's other passive suicidal

277
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,480
thoughts such as i hope i don't wake up

278
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,120
tomorrow if i you know jerked my

279
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,000
steering wheel right now um it could be

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,399
over uh but there's no intent behind

281
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
them there's no thought out plan

282
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,839
um and they they typically crop up

283
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,519
because of depression um making it more

284
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,920
appealing uh to

285
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,519
to uh

286
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,000
die rather than continue life

287
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,959
but

288
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,200
no one should have to face this alone

289
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
that's why we're talking about it

290
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,519
whether it's comfortable or not

291
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,880
it's better to talk about it as a

292
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,839
community and be aware of these issues

293
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,079
than let people who are facing this face

294
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,120
it alone and by bringing it up someone

295
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
may who may have felt

296
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,360
uncomfortable talking to people before

297
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
may find their way to feel comfortable

298
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,839
and

299
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,760
it's important uh

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,880
to

301
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,600
you know because infosec a lot of times

302
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,560
there's

303
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,200
our industry is not suited to face these

304
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,360
challenges and so

305
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,440
we need to start treating mental health

306
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,480
issues like we talk about a

307
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
uh

308
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,279
a physical health issue um because it is

309
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,519
that same level you know if somebody

310
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,760
needed to take time off work to deal

311
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,720
with treatment for diabetes uh you're

312
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,800
not gonna tell them no suck it up stick

313
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,880
it out um and we need to face mental

314
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,639
health the same way we need to be able

315
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,959
to say how your employee needs to be

316
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,600
comfortable to say uh you know my

317
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
depression is crippling today i need to

318
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
take the time um

319
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,639
to take care of myself so that this does

320
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,279
not impact me long term uh and be able

321
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,519
to take that time so that's why we talk

322
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,880
about this

323
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,920
um

324
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,720
we we have to get the word out uh like i

325
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,959
mentioned beforehand burnout even though

326
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,839
i haven't touched on burnout

327
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,279
specifically um burnout rates are so

328
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,279
high in cyber security probably everyone

329
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,839
knows someone who is in cyber loving

330
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,720
cyber and then you know decided yeah

331
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,519
maybe i'll change careers um

332
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,440
because

333
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,639
we

334
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,639
we're pushed to our limits especially if

335
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,720
you're in a high pressure field

336
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,760
like a sock or incident response

337
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,200
um

338
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,360
you know overwhelmed with clients for

339
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,279
different projects

340
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,880
we

341
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,839
add on mental health issues pre-existing

342
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,839
on top of that uh

343
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,880
this is why our hiring rates are are so

344
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
low in cyber security

345
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,959
every time we bring new people in we

346
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,638
have people leaving because of burnout

347
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,920
so

348
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,920
i want to move into talking about uh

349
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,279
kind of the start of mental health

350
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,079
hackers how we got here like i said info

351
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,600
sister had been talking about mental

352
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,760
health for a little while um a few other

353
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,920
people in the community had started

354
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,079
sharing talks like this at conference

355
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,079
especially talking about their issues

356
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,959
trying to break that stigma by saying

357
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
look i'm facing this let's talk about it

358
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,920
um all of us need to talk about it so

359
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
um

360
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
there was

361
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,959
with the interest uh from infosister's

362
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,839
first talk on mental health she wanted

363
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,920
to come up with a way to do kind of this

364
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,839
mental health workshop like how at

365
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
conferences can we we bring our presence

366
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,399
and bring up this topic um

367
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,199
so

368
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,000
the idea she kind of came up with was

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,360
okay let's

370
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,639
have a chill room a quiet area where

371
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,199
people can hang out at conferences get

372
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,800
away from the noise

373
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,760
get away from you know being bombarded

374
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,639
with

375
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,440
uh

376
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
infosec

377
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,199
um especially people who had anxiety

378
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,279
often conferences are rough to meet that

379
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,279
many new people so where's a place where

380
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,079
i can

381
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,000
go sit in a hole

382
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,519
and

383
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,600
ignore that

384
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,959
for a little while

385
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,160
so

386
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,240
that's where uh at derbycon 8 2018 the

387
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
year before their final year

388
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
uh

389
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,959
amanda submitted a cfp for derbycon

390
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,760
got accepted

391
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,360
and

392
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,480
they

393
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,800
said we can either give you sponsors or

394
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,920
you can try crowdfunding and she wanted

395
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
to see

396
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,600
what the community the support we could

397
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,839
get for the community how

398
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
uh people have what the interest and

399
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
reception was gaby you know before the

400
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
village was even there so we set up

401
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,639
crowdfunding uh she needed three

402
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,360
thousand dollars you know for travel for

403
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,760
all the supplies and this was the first

404
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,120
time

405
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,399
and the gofundme actually raised over 7

406
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,680
000

407
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
dollars

408
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,759
between 28 donors

409
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,800
so

410
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,160
the village came up it launched uh

411
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,880
and a few statistics there was 22

412
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,160
volunteers

413
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,480
eight presentations dedicated to mental

414
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
health topics instead of infosec

415
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,839
specifically

416
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,839

blue team con to have to pay what where

443
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,279
outrageous costs for

444
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,160
projectors and stuff uh so the format

445
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
actually ended up being very loose but

446
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,799
very great people sat down at the table

447
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
to give their talk and just kind of

448
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,520
roundtabled it uh pulled up their talk

449
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,760
on their laptop if they had slides

450
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,520
um and and

451
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,640
it it was it turned out really well um

452
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,880
even without uh having that that set up

453
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,000
um

454
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,079
so along with the yoga and stuff the

455
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,199
yoga presentations massage therapy

456
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,000
uh

457
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,600
we had paracord crafts essential oils a

458
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,039
therapy dog came to visit the first one

459
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,200
a fidget table was

460
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,080
super popular uh lots of different

461
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
fidget toys to try

462
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,919
and yeah so

463
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,280
it ended up being really well

464
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
and coming out of this

465
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,880
um there was clear interest that

466
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,799
first a bunch of other conferences

467
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,720
started reaching out hey we saw you did

468
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
this mental health village um if we have

469
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,440
a sponsor can you come how can we donate

470
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,679
to this being run without the gofundme

471
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,760
still being out

472
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,919
and that is when the

473
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,679
idea for a non-profit a 501c3 popped up

474
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,799
and named it mental health hackers i had

475
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,360
a friend create the logo

476
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,640
amanda i i unfortunately i will always

477
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
be bummed i did not get to be at the

478
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,559
first conference

479
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,520
at that time i had never even met amanda

480
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,799
in person

481
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,600
but we had talked a few times she knew

482
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,760
i had talked about mental health and was

483
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,520
a huge advocate so she said well do you

484
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
want to come on board

485
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
so november 14th we got our official

486
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,600
business license operating as a

487
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,520
non-profit and by april 11th 2019

488
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,799
we had our 501c3 dedication

489
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,160
and

490
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
the

491
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,840
at the lowest level how we describe

492
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,160
mental health hackers is where hackers

493
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,840
helping hackers

494
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
amanda often talks about how it's kind

495
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,640
of aa but for

496
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,039
hackers we we want to bring up issues

497
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,120

498
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,840
community

499
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,480
so

500
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,280

501
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,720

up until this is all pre-covered

504
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,480
statistics we started running our

505
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
village again i believe we've had two so

506
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,520

513
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,320
70 volunteers in our slack

514
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,679
and

515
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,200
we've

516
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
we've built up the capability to run

517
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,480
four villages at once if there was four

518
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
conferences that wanted us in a single

519
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,160
weekend

520
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,760
we now have two full villages and two

521
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,960
mini villages which is basically we have

522
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,520
all the supplies you need to run a basic

523
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,640
village

524
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
in shippable boxes

525
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
uh so that that was a lot of growth for

526
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,360
us i mean find us on social media if you

527
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,760
want to check it out um

528
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
in terms of location we've actually

529
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
committed to

530
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,600
we've actually run the village in three

531
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,919
different countries i believe germany

532
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,400
england and the united states so i take

533
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,559
that back we did toronto since the last

534
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,480
time so four countries

535
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,559
um dozens of states

536
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,360
uh and so it's been great to bring this

537
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,919
not just to the us or to

538
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,400
our local um

539
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,320
areas but to the whole world essentially

540
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,039
so

541
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,960
just a quick introduction giving

542
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
recognition to the board follow them all

543
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,080
on twitter like i said amanda infosister

544
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
she's the brains behind this operates it

545
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,760
um and we have a few other officers um

546
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
on board who help with various things

547
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
run the nonprofit

548
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,520
special shout out to ginger hacks or tom

549
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,039
um definitely check him out he's

550
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,159
actually on the board of

551
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,679
vetcon

552
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,080
and we brought him on to

553
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,120
find the intersect of veterans and

554
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
mental health so

555
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
that's a cool role that

556
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,280
didn't exist at first but he's been so

557
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
much help we wanted to integrate that

558
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,760
so what's next for us uh we developed a

559
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
long-term vision

560
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
a lot of sponsors ask

561
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
what are we gonna do in five years ten

562
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,480
years what if we had an unlimited budget

563
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,360
um

564
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,240
so

565
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,039
me and uh

566
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,039
amanda start brainstorming what do we

567
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,280
want to do uh one of them's already

568
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,159
implemented our ambassador program uh

569
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,400
unless any of you would like to pay for

570
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,200
me and amanda to travel to conferences

571
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,400
full time

572
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
unfortunately

573
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,039
we have day jobs too

574
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,480
and

575
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,120
we've got to

576
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,799
kind of delegate some of these

577
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,000
conferences

578
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,520
so for example if somebody uh in toronto

579
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,280
that was one case where they wanted a

580
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,440
conference neither of us had the time

581
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,159
nor the ability at the time to travel to

582
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,679
canada um so we had someone who lived

583
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,520
right across the border who was willing

584
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,400
to drive up the ambassador kit

585
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,559
and again those are shippable so

586
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,880
any volunteer or ambassador as we call

587
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,520
them who's uh comfortable running the

588
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,440
village at a conference that wants it

589
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,400
we're able to do that

590
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,200
long long term if we had the budget we

591
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,400
want to start offering endowments

592
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
think about the fact that

593
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,600
not

594
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
mental health services often come with a

595
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
price

596
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,640
and

597
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,679
especially if your job does not provide

598
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,760
those benefits we want to be able to

599
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,440
help people get the help they need

600
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,280
we'd want to partner with online support

601
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,200
services there's a lot of online therapy

602
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
services now where you can text or call

603
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,760
or chat

604
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,280
with therapists and

605
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
most of all and i actually started doing

606
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,039
this year this year coordinating

607
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,039
we want to get

608
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,000
as many people as possible mental health

609
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,799
first aid certified um so this is

610
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,360
just like your red cross first aid

611
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,480
course but how to handle um

612
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,440
handle a mental health crisis

613
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,039
long enough for

614
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,360
a doctor or

615
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,799
a emergency services to get to a person

616
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,960
just like with first aid you're not the

617
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,360
doctor that's going to bandage someone

618
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,200
up or give them stitches um or or treat

619
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,640
them long term

620
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,799
but if you need to give cpr if you need

621
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,279
to stop bleeding on a wound

622
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,200
first aid gives you the ability to do

623
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,960
that so

624
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,400
while

625
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
you're not gonna be the person who

626
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,440
treats someone or takes care of someone

627
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
necessarily um you're not a doctor and

628
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,360
able to diagnose things

629
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,760
if there is a schizophrenic person who's

630
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,080
having an episode and you need to calm

631
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,600
them down

632
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,799
or somebody has made comments

633
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,919
that

634
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,559
they are thinking of committing suicide

635
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,400
until you can get to them to that

636
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
professional

637
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,240
who can solve the deeper issues making

638
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,000
sure that they're safe and the people

639
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,720
are around them are safe um

640
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,320
just a quick intro into uh

641
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,559
but the the key point of mental health

642
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,799
hackers is they

643
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,559
talk about a concept called algae

644
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,200
when you're responding you assess for

645
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
the risk of suicide or harm

646
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,919
you listen that's the biggest thing

647
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,279
you give them reassurance and

648
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,000
information and encourage them to go get

649
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
professional help and then also

650
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
encourage self-help and support

651
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,960
strategies

652
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,039
so

653
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,600
one of the things uh one of the issues i

654
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,200
guess we came across when we started

655
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,039
mental health hackers well we had

656
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,320
massive support from a lot of people

657
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,000
we did unfortunately

658
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,159
come across a lot of people

659
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,799
who were very upset we were starting the

660
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,360
organization they asked us how we're

661
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,799
qualified

662
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,720
where the doctors are as part of our

663
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
group but

664
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,840
there's so many resources out there that

665
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,720
talk about how peer support works so

666
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,799
instead of losing it back on people who

667
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,360
were getting upset with us and

668
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,320
and responding poorly amanda got all the

669
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,440
research out there on peer support and

670
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,200
how it works i mean we we see all the

671
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,760
alcohol anonymous and narcotics

672
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,679
anonymous like there's these peer

673
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,600
support groups where just talking and

674
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,559
breaking down the stigma is enough to to

675
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,440
help people even as if it's

676
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,279
uh to help them seek professional help

677
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,960
at no point will any of our board

678
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,440
members especially me and amanda claim

679
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,760
that we're able to help professionally

680
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,159
we just want to be able to

681
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,919
talk to the community

682
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,799

so it is getting out there we are

723
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,720
starting to talk about this a lot um

724
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,399
2017-2018 is when i recall

725
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
the discussion starting to get broader

726
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
there's higher visibility into mental

727
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
health

728
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,880
so

729
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,679
it's not just uh

730
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,840
in an industry and in our community that

731
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,039
we need to

732
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,039
work on this though we also need to

733
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,039
start changing things in the workplace

734
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,360
kind of like i said the the idea that

735
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,000
you wouldn't fire someone for needing to

736
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,799
go

737
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,720
treat their diabetes or their heart

738
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,320
issues

739
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,360
if somebody's burnt out has bad anxiety

740
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
is literally crippled by mental health

741
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,440
to the point that they can't work

742
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,559
um

743
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,480
either bringing up these

744
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,159
these stigmas are saying you know stick

745
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,360
it out like you know you're not sick uh

746
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,840
it is a horrible issue

747
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
um

748
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,200
and so many people are

749
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
not comfortable

750
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
talking to their boss their leadership

751
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,679
hr about the mental health issue they're

752

754
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,360
myself

755
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,480
i

756
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,320
feel comfortable talking to my

757
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,880
leadership about the issues i know that

758
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
if i come to them and say hey i need a

759
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,159

763
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,559

765
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,880
handled um so

766
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,230
we

767
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,480
[Music]

768
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,960
i wish i could what i want to say is if

769
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,000
you work in a place where you don't feel

770
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,200
comfortable

771
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,600
you're working in the wrong place leave

772
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,840
um

773
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,520
but people need to make money people

774
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,360
need jobs so

775
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,120
unfortunately leaving isn't always the

776
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,679
option so it's the

777
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,120
workplace that needs to

778
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,440
change a lot um

779
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,039
we need to create environments and

780
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,880
workplace where people are comfortable

781
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,640
bringing up the issues

782
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,279
instead of just making things work by

783
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,919
trying to suffer through a hospital

784
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,080
hostile work environment

785
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,039

787
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,039

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,039
people it helps mental health um but

855
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,640
when you're introduced into a negative

856
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,320
work environment uh is is not

857
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,159
gonna be a positive thing for mental

858
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,720
health um harassment and bullying over

859
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,679
mental uh are common problems in the

860
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,559
workplace and will have an

861
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,559
adverse impact on mental health

862
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,399
especially if you're

863
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,240
speaking about someone who already has

864
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,279
issues

865
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,960
somebody has anxiety

866
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,519
of what people think of them and they're

867
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,960
outwardly

868
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,360
being bullied or having things commented

869
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,679
on it's just going to get worse

870
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,600
um

871
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,840
so

872
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,840
let's see

873
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,080
so what are some changes that can be

874
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,519
made first

875
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,120
flexibility like i said when somebody

876
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,840
is is having issues and getting burnt

877
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,760
out knowing that you may need to make

878
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,240
adjustments

879
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,200
so

880
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,399
uh a couple

881
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,559
suggestions if you have the budget a

882
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,000
monthly stipend um getting people giving

883
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,320
people a stipend to use for therapy

884
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
meditation gym memberships anything

885
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,039
that's gonna help their mental health uh

886
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,600
a very important thing is healthier work

887
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,120
hours if somebody's uh

888
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,480
for me that's a big thing is kind of

889
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,039
having the flexibility um of knowing

890
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,279
that i can work the hours that work best

891
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,240
for me

892
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,600
uh especially in in a lot of roles where

893
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,440
people feel the pressure to be around

894
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,239
that's how we burn out is either working

895
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,839
long hours um working hours that impact

896
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,599
a person's ability to maintain a

897
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,159
work-life balance

898
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,239
another thing is getting the employee

899
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,399
buy-in if you're going to move forward

900
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,239
with these programs you need your

901
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,199
employees to

902
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,599
be involved and recognize it

903
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,000
people don't take advantage of these

904
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,359
benefits like let's say the monthly

905
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,399
stipend example you may see a low um

906
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,679
low interaction with that thing um but

907
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,480
it may be because there's not awareness

908
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,800
a lot of times like i consistently find

909
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,199
out about programs that exist for

910
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,160
employees at ibm that just aren't well

911
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,079
advertised so you know you might just

912
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,200
come across it at some point per mention

913
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,520
so it's important getting it out there

914
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,760
and then again that stigma is kind of

915
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,240
like if you think about those companies

916
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,960
that offer unlimited pto and there's

917
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,280
always that concern about like was it

918
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,119
really unlimited like i don't feel like

919
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,800
i can use it because then i'm taking

920
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,240
advantage same thing with a mental

921
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,880
health like like well they give me this

922
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
stipend but if i start

923
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,079
using it

924
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,000
um are

925
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,280
people going to uh

926
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,920
are people going to start judging me or

927
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,280
asking what's wrong with me that i'm

928
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,839
using this budget

929
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,320
and it's important that that leadership

930
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,400
um kind of show their support of these

931
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,440
programs open up about their own issues

932
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,480
to show

933
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,640
that it's not

934
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
a negative thing to talk about it

935
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,280
we want to make it easier

936
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,960
to get help

937
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
whether that's opening workplace

938
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,640
dialogue providing coping strategies um

939
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,359
off making sure your insurance plans

940
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,960
cover therapy

941
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,000
those kinds of things

942
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,040
some organizations may provide online

943
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,400
therapy services

944
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,440
to their employees while others uh bring

945
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,280
professionals in-house for example

946
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,200
there's a

947
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,000
an accounting firm in illinois that

948
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,160
illinois star that all of them their

949
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,320
employees they have access to a

950
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,880
psychologist that's in-house

951
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,440
and a certified life coach that comes in

952
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,079
once a year to talk to employees

953
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,680
and then track your progress again

954
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,400
speaking to the managers and leaderships

955
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,240
like any program you implement you have

956
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,520
to justify it um so are we seeing a

957
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,320
lower rate of people leaving the company

958
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,240
lower rates of burnout

959
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,359
it's important to track

960
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,280
quality of the work being produced in

961
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,560
productivity levels turnover rate sick

962
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,920
days

963
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
to show that these programs are working

964
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,599
and best bet is they are going to work

965
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,800
there's a reason we're talking about

966
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,839
this and bringing up these

967
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,240
recommendations

968
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,520
the apa they have a thing called the

969
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,320
collaborative care program that gives an

970
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,839
outline of um kind of working the

971
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,720
workplace um and uh providing resources

972
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,240
uh so that's a good resource to visit if

973
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
you'd like to

974
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,960
get

975
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,079
get some more information

976
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,079
workplacementalhealth.org

977
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,400
there's also things you can do on an

978
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,480
individual level

979
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,760
changing your day-to-day in order to

980
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,240
improve yourself you can't just rely on

981
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,000
your company to improve your mental

982
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,960
health

983
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,880
so it's important that

984
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,119
while it's important that the workplace

985
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,880
make adjustments you have to make

986
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,720
adjustments yourself

987
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,280
i feel confident when i'm working when i

988
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,160
do go to my leadership and say hey

989
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,920
i need you to adjust this in order to

990
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,560
support my mental health or i need a day

991
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,359
off

992
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,040
i'm also making sure that i'm meeting

993
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,079
them halfway like okay you're doing this

994
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,680
meanwhile i'm doing this you know i'm

995
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,839
taking a day off but i'm spending that

996
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:12,640
day

997
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,480
figuring out how to get past these

998
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,119
issues so that tomorrow i come in a

999
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,400
better employee

1000
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,839
um

1001
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,960
so

1002
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,760
one thing i also want to talk about um

1003
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,280
not just changing your day-to-day um but

1004
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,960
changing how you interact in the

1005
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,920
workplace and with other people to

1006
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
ensure that there's a peer support

1007
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,800
community um so

1008
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,000
a lot of times uh we say the wrong thing

1009
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,160
like i said depression

1010
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,760
a lot of people there's the stigma it

1011
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,079
just means the person says so like hey

1012
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:46,880
you know

1013
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,560
uh

1014
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,240
cheer up like there's good things

1015
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
happening like that is not something

1016
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,400
helpful to say um

1017
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,560
calm down is about the worst thing you

1018
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,800
can say to me when i'm having one of my

1019
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,920
autistic meltdowns or breakdowns like i

1020
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,000
calm down as not what you say to me

1021
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,920
because i would calm down if i could

1022
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,839
like that is something uncontrollable

1023
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,400
due to mental health issues

1024
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,280
so

1025
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,720
um one thing your words um

1026
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,680
matter

1027
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,560
uh

1028
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,720
learn what people

1029
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,040
with mental health issues

1030
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,440
face so like um a lot of autistic people

1031
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
prefer to be called autistic over a

1032
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,359
person with autism um there's

1033
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,400
things like schizo or crazy don't use

1034
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,320
those words to

1035
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,560
describe

1036
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,440
people with mental health as issues

1037
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,359
i always say it's best

1038
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,240
to talk to the person um facing that

1039
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,920
mental health issues to see what they're

1040
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,599
comfortable with

1041
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,440
and then um

1042
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,560
again be kind uh

1043
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,119
that doesn't mean say everything's fine

1044
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,760
just relax the way you offer support to

1045
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,240
someone facing challenges

1046
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,760
is being supportive of the issue

1047
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,359
and safety's like i'm sorry you weren't

1048
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,800
feeling well

1049
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,400
i've noticed you've been upset is there

1050
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,800
anything i can do can i help out what do

1051
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,480
you think about what are you struggling

1052
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,000
with uh

1053
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,319
that's why i try to ask my friends

1054
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,040
and people i interact with um

1055
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,839
i

1056
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,319
typically i don't think i ever say it's

1057
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,480
gonna be okay or

1058
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,440
you know

1059
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,960
just chill out

1060
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,040
i i'm always trying to get too deep of

1061
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,280

1062

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,720

1065
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,000
in closing

1066
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,760
uh

1067
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,800
there's so much more we can do um

1068
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,960
speaking of which mental health hackers

1069
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,040
uh last i think in may um we ran a

1070
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,119
hackers who paid session um think of

1071
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,880
like painting with the twists were those

1072
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,280

1073
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,160

but most important

1082
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,760
outside of the organization in general

1083
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,440
our community needs to talk

1084
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,359
support each other

1085
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,119
and make sure we're

1086
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,359
bringing these issues to awareness in

1087
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,200
the community and our workplaces
