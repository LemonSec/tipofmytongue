group id has

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,440
been on the cyber security market for 18

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
years last week we had a birthday party

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440

and products from digital risk

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,720
protection and computer forensic with

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,680
threat hunting to technical return of

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,320
online portals such as banks and the

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,640
whole framework of protect customer

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,720
networks from malicious files and

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,640
targeted attacks

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
without threat intelligence and threat

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
hunting systems all

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,320
these like

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,119
services and products allows us to do

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,960
our researches and especially this one

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,799
and about my team

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,439
we help our clients information security

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,799
incident management provide

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,840
recommendations have all the necessaries

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,200
lines tears and specialists for this

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
inside the team from analysts and

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
reverse engineers to team leads and sock

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
architects with our

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,280
mssp program which is pretty popular now

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,440
plus against

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,280
fishing and malware for this we have

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
membership in many associations

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,520
i think you know all of them it's like

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,040
first trust introduce your organization

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
of islamic corporation

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,920
apw g and t fish working group and on

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,760
the territory of the russian generation

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,080
we have unique competencies uh

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,959
in all russian diamond zones happens

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,360
and others such colleagues so if some of

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,319
you

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,519
have

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,760
some problems with

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,800
physical resources so for example in

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
you can

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,160
just write to me on the mail and we will

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,120
help you

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,040
i think pretty quickly

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,840
less than for the one day for

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,080
free and about the report

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
uh it provides information on the

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,519
tactics tools and the infrastructure of

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,040
the queries

78
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,760
our rapper's goal is to minimize the

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
risk of the groups

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,239
getting further illegal acts suppress

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,120
any such activities in the timely manner

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
and raise awareness among listeners

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,720
the report also cons indicators of

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
compromise that organizations and

85
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,360
specialists can use to check the

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,519
networks for compromise as well as

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,840
recommendations on how to

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,920
protect against future attacks

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,080
one thing most subsequent security

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,120
experts agree on is ransomware continues

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,280
to be public enemy number one uh it's no

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,360
longer surprising that ransomware

93
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,879
attacks are becoming

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,080
more sophisticated and threat actors

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
successful with every passing years

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,879
more and more players joined this game

97
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,200
disrupting more and more businesses all

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,480
around the world

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
ransomware itself as well as attackers

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,400
ttps

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,720
become become increasingly complex

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,920
protection and analysis really tough uh

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
traditionally vulnerable

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,280
fusions like

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,159
university hospitals also became popular

106
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,840
targets there are just

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
like some of them

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,239
which

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,120
were hit in the nearest period of time

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880
uh a terrifying prospect that emerged

111
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,759
2020 was that transfer attacks could

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,199
potentially cost

113
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,800
leaves uh dusseldorf paramedics go

114
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
unable to admit a 78

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,560
year old patient to a nearby hospital

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
because it was under a ransomware attack

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,280
they were forced to travel 20 miles to

118
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,080
the next nearest medical facility and

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,479
this delay in treatment caused the

120
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,759
patient's death

121
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,960
there are

122
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,919
indicators that more ransomware groups

123
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,800
will soon change tactics dramatically

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
from transfer deployment to data

125
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
exfiltration and extortion

126
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
the maze group

127
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,240
attacked xerox and lg stealing and

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,880
publishing over 70 gigabytes of data

129
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
after the companies refused to pay

130
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,320
uh egregor continued to

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
extort weapons by posting actually

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
exfiltrated data online

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,280
and most ethics on enterprises are human

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,680
operated so it's vital that defenders

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
understand the tactics techniques and

136
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,080
procedures used by protectors that

137
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,199
they can stop

138
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
taxing at different stages of

139
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
the attack life cycle

140
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,160
uh like key findings is that ransomware

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
operators are

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,280
less concerned about the industry and

143
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,320
more focused on scope and scale

144
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,800
that is why threat actors prefer to go

145
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,360
after large enterprise networks they

146
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
help to secure the greatest possible

147
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,479
ransom

148
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,720
profitable targets encourage protectors

149
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
to bring ransom demands

150
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
to new heights

151
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,240
if in 2019 the average ransom was about

152
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,479
eighty thousand dollars on the average

153
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,560
in uh 2020 because 21 isn't finished yet

154
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,280
was

155
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,520
some

156
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,120
170 thousand dollars

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
but we may see the norm shift towards

158
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,639
them millions of dollars soon enough

159
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,759
corporate

160
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,919
environments usually run not only

161
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,560
windows system but also linux which has

162
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,400
led to some protectors adding

163
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,080
corresponding version to their arsenals

164
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,720
ransomware as a service programs

165
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
has

166
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
become increasingly prevalent on

167
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
underground forms uh long-standing

168
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
e-crime actors who use commodity malware

169
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,639
such as trade blood quagbot and drydex

170
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,520
help many ransomware operators obtain

171
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,479
initial access to target networks

172
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,360
and the state-sponsored uh threat actors

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,840
also began showing interest in big game

174
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,160
hunting groups such as

175
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,639
lazarus and apg-27

176
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
started to use ransomware during

177
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
financially motivated operations

178
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,599
um

179
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,880
there's some kind of illustration of

180
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,720
my previous speech

181
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,759
that

182
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,080
i think the third of all

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,440
uh ransomware's groups it's like real

184
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,720
egregor

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
and maze more than

186
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
30

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
36

188
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,880
but it will be don't matter for you if

189
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,919
you

190
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,000
like

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,440
if you will

192
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,120
included by dark side or regular locker

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,199
your own organizations

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,520
it's like statistics such as things

195
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,280
um

196
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,240
this is some kind of ransomware which

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,039
use different boards like three bot used

198
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,479
rook county rebel ransom x

199
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,080
quack uh used usually prog or a gregor

200
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,440
double paper

201
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,840
um but all

202
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,800
the lcu will be available to see and

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,599
download in our own pretty big i think

204
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,400
report uh immediate from our site you

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,479
will see the link later

206
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,800
um

207
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,000
yes

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,919
as you can see

209
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,879
there are like two main

210
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,720
primary vectors of compromise it is

211
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
external remote services and

212
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
fishing

213
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,000
is still very popular in

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,640
in many cyber criminal groups

215
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,880
as well as on the

216
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,919
bottom right corner you see the um like

217
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,640
differentiating uh between somewhere the

218
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
servers and different ransomware groups

219
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,959
ransomware as a service is

220
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,360
very popular right now

221
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
on the many cyber criminal forums

222
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
and here is a

223
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,360
miter attack heat map

224
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,279
made by us

225
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,560
as

226
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,760
more bright that's where you see like

227
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,120
bright red

228
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
we see much more frequently than the

229
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
yellow one

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,240
you can read this in this way

231
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,760
ah but as you remember the heat map

232
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,839
very

233
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,160
huge the matter of matrix is a very huge

234
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,279
map is a

235
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,240
same huge i think uh and has many

236
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,360
tactics at the site and only two of them

237
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,240
from mitre are not in this list it is

238
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,959
reconnaissance and resource development

239
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,440
so we will talk now about just

240
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,920
some more interesting tactics techniques

241
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,279
and the field version again in the

242
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,120
report uh first one is a initial access

243
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
publicly accessible rdp servers are

244
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,240
still the most common target for many

245
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
ransomware operators from down to rival

246
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,160
uh with the covet 19 pandemic

247
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,880
requiring requiring many people to work

248
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,760
from home the number of such servers

249
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,000
grew exponentially many successful

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
intrusions start from password guessing

251
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
or credentials

252
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,200
uh in many cases ransomware was deployed

253
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,519
after an arc connection

254
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,240
and was made to a compromised server

255
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,720
followed by a lateral movement to one of

256
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
the dummy controllers the main

257
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
controllers rdp servers are not the only

258
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
external remote service services

259
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
targeted by ransomware protectors so we

260
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,320
use brute force attacks such attacks

261
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,440
were also initiated against

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,079
vpn appliances like in

263
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,640
multi-factor authentication

264
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,279
uh to deliver malware to the target to

265
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
the target hosts converters use

266
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,399
efficient commands

267
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,880
in many cases the threat actors employed

268
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,720
the so-called threat hijacking

269
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,440
techniques which makes emails look as

270
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
they were sent by a trusted party the

271
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,079
threat actors use phishing link online

272
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,040
services like dropbox google drive

273
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
and weaponized attached

274
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,279
attachments in various forms from common

275
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,120
documents and spreadsheets

276
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,240
zipped executables and the scripts they

277
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,279
have used emitted report quackbot by

278
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,839
buzzer and other

279
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,640
malware in paints

280
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,279
some adversaries were more creative an

281
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,800
excellent example of

282
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,519
creativity it was a bad usb attack

283
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,680
attacks conducted by fin7 also known as

284
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,720
carbon

285
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,120
in march 2020

286
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,720
me personally

287
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,519
mostly read about this in the books but

288
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,560
i've never seen like in a in the wild

289
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
such a but

290
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,959
in the previous year the group mailed

291
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,200
fake letters from best buy containing

292
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,399
the nice usb devices and the 50

293
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,279
gift card gift card the letter said that

294
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,000
the recipient could spend the card on

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,160
any goods from a list

296
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
which stored on the device on the this

297
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,120
usb

298
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,399
flash drive

299
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,560
plugin's usb device into a computer

300
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,360
executed a powershell command

301
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,839
and led to a griffon backdoor being

302
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,440
downloaded and run

303
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,160
pin 7 joined the big game in 2020

304
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,560
starting from their collaboration with

305
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,959
operators and moving to their own

306
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,120
ransomware as a service program

307
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
dark side

308
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
execution

309
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,240
as

310
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
many adversaries often use malicious

311
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,480
email attachments during the initial

312
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,440
access

313
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,000
many different interpreters were also

314
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,959
widely used including shell

315
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,800
windows common shell

316
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,959
uh visual basic and javascript

317
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,560
powershell was still widely used used by

318
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,600
many protectors at points of the cyber

319
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
kill chain

320
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
uh dried accelerators for example uh

321
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,519
used to download the initial payload

322
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
from the compromised website powershell

323
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,720
also used by many ransomware samples to

324
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,680
remove volume shadow copies

325
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,079
from infected hosts which

326
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,880
can be useful sometimes when we encrypt

327
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
soon

328
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,240
windows command

329
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
shell was extremely popular as well

330
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,079
especially during the initial access

331
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
stage

332
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
persistence

333
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480
the most popular techniques used by the

334
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
attack to provide persistence uh

335
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,000
is

336
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
you see many of them

337
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
i think we will focus on

338
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,680
just i can't throw in them

339
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,560
t57 it is registry run keys or stuff for

340
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,880
startup folder both one of the most

341
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,959
common persistence mechanism observed in

342
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,240
2020

343
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
another card was abusing features of vin

344
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,320
logon which was used by puzzle

345
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
operators

346
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
t 1053 uh creating a schedule

347
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,600
was the most common persistent mechanism

348
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,959
observed during

349
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,360
our own instant responses engagements

350
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,680
and cyber threat research uh its

351
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,240
popularity could be attributed to a wide

352
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,399
variety of commodity malware used by

353
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,560
many ransomware operators to gain an

354
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,480
initial foothold

355
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,519
and then t1078

356
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,399
the final persistence technique uh

357
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
observed by us was

358
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,240
was to abuse

359
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,399
valid accounts as many intrusions

360
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,360
started from unauthorized rdp access or

361
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,880
exploiting to

362
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,360
exporting a public-facing application

363
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,000
threat actors obtained credentials these

364
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
grind levels of privileges during

365
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
initial access

366
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,199
uh attackers

367
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,360
used these credentials or those

368
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,199
collected during the credentials access

369
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,040
stage to obtain redundant access to

370
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
the compromised infrastructure

371
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,800
um

372
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,880
defense evasion

373
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,000
we

374
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,399
witnessed cases of retractors using

375
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,199
background intelligence transfer servers

376
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,399
or bits

377
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,519
here to download malicious code silently

378
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,760
and bypass defenses

379
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,120
igrador

380
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,680
i'm sorry gregor ransomware affiliates

381
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,320
use scripts with the following content

382
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
to download and run ransomware payloads

383
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,000
most protector disabled or modified

384
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
security tools during the most

385
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
exploitation phase many dharma

386
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,120
ransomware affiliates

387
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,839
use pc hunter and process hacker

388
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,920
i think you know all these programs

389
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,160
to identify and terminate security

390
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,279
software

391
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,480
also

392
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
masquerading technique is very popular

393
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
in recent attacks

394
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,600
the experts also observed that malware

395
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
or other tools used for post

396
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,480
exploitation we are named after common

397
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
windows system

398
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
executables

399
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,759
for example some egregor affiliates

400
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,360
rename the rclone executable

401
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,440
to svcost.exe

402
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,240
and put it in the c windows folder

403
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,639
credential access when your ransomware

404
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,120
operators gain their initial footfall to

405
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,560
the rdp i said this to obtain credit

406
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,720
credentials threat actors used password

407
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,279
casing passwords training and relations

408
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,720
traffic mostly

409
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,880
based on our engagements the most

410
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,040
popular tools for brute force attacks

411
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
were nl brood and hydra

412
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
in some cases and albert was also used

413
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,279
to check

414
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,519
whether the accounts obtained were

415
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,680
loaded enterprise-wide

416
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
web browsers a common password

418
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,199
many of

419
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,480
our

420
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,360
like clients use this way and to store

421
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,639
the passwords

422
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,440
uh so many protectors developed the

423
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,759
ability to extract credentials from them

424
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,839
from from the

425
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,720

428
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,440
stores

429
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
among all credential dumping

430
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,000
remains the main the most common

431
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,160
technique used by ransomware operators

432
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,039
to obtain very privileged credentials

433
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:07,839
and

434
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,919
move laterally

435
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,959
attackers usually used broad dump

436
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
to dump local security

437
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,839
authority subsystem services process

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,679
various credential dumping sub

441
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,280
techniques including

442
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,079
sas memory uh security account manager

443
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,200
lsa secrets and

444
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,039
domain credentials in some cases

445
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,320
attackers extract the saf from windows

446
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,879

447
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,400
seven uh technical micromap is discovery

449
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,760
next one and lateral movement

450
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,160
uh like discoveries

451
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
so where operators focused on attacking

452
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,039
corporate networks adversaries commonly

453
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,880
collected information about active

454
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880

it's groups computer demand trust

457
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,120
relationships one of the most common

458
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,200
tools for collecting the

459
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
aforementioned question was a defined

460
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
another common tools for active director

461
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,280
reconnaissance uh was bloodhound or

462
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,080
sharp hound which also allowed attackers

463
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,559
to collect and analyze information about

464
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,679
users groups and demand trust

465
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,559
and

466
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,799
regarding lateral movement to eternal

467
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,280
bloom widely known

468
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,440
was the most common vulnerability used

469
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,919
for lateral movement in addition some

470
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
threat actors involved in ransomware

471
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,360
attacks exploited the zero logo

472
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,440
last year vulnerability

473
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,679
to establish a vulnerable net loan

474
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,559
session

475
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,559
and gain the main administrator of

476
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,720
privileges thereby enabling the pro

477
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,840
movement

478
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,720
um a common ransomware

479
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,559
deployment that was

480
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,559
ps exec abuse as noted above rdp was

481
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,240
only the most common initial access

482
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,840
vector but also a common way to move

483
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,080
laterally through the network in their

484
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,960
ethanol some ransomware operators even

485
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,160
had scripts for enabling rdp on remote

486
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,880
house they usually executed them via

487
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,840
base exact to

488
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,799
exfiltration before performing

489
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,120
acceleration many ransomware operators

490
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,080
use

491
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
common uh achieving utilities such as

492
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,120
finra or 7-zip which is proper

493
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,080
in many threat actors to compress data

494
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,640
some adversaries like maze uh

495
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,200
split such archives into multiple parts

496
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,039
so that the data could be exfiltrated

497
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,679
without triggering security controls

498
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,880
um

499
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
so again if you are like a security

500
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,760
administrator

501
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,120
and you see many archives

502
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
like tons of them

503
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,799
at the same day

504
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,039
it's not so good

505
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,640
marker for you

506
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,720
you have to see what's happening on this

507
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,840
computer for example

508
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,799
ransomware operators didn't blindly

509
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,799
collect data they knew that they were

510
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,600
doing

511
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,880
club

512
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
op ransomware

513
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
affiliates search for workstations that

514
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
were used by top managers so that the

515
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,159
most sensitive data could be collected

516
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,120
for fire extortion extra traded data was

517
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,640
usually posted

518
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,000
publicly on a so-called data leak site

519
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,520
you know it is

520
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,760
very good uh feed

521
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,840
for us to collect the possible victims

522
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
the most active cyber security groups

523
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,840
and so on here is example of dls to

524
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
double payment

525
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,039
ransomware operators

526
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,640
uh

527
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,280
protectors set up auctions before

528
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,240
publishing a situated data tls a good

529
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,120
example is a real group which has a

530
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,400
special page on its dls it's

531
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
on the second screen here

532
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
uh

533
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,360
operators are known to

534
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,480
exfiltrate data but they do not deal

535
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,799
less they instead show the proof of

536
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,280
exfiltration to the victim personally

537
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,840
not so publicly as the ls sites or

538
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,520
collaborate with other factors so they

539
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,600
pretty good work which is each other

540
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,880
and it's like the last one

541
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,799
the impact

542
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,440
in mitre matrix

543
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,120
the main goal for ransomware operators

544
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,159
was to

545
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,400
encrypt data for impact

546
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
many ransomware families were

547
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,360
distributed through ransomware as a

548
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,960
service programs

549
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,080
um and since each

550
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,200
has multiple affiliates uh there may be

551
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,559
shifts in the ttpc by third actors

552
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,520
before

553
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
actually

554
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
deploying ransom operators did their

555
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,400
best to find and remove any available

556
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,039
backups so it would be impossible for

557
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,640
the victim to recover encrypted data

558
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,520
ransomware developers uh usually used

559
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
strong encryption

560
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,080
to make it impossible to decrypt files

561
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,960
without the keys

562
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
encryption algorithms used by the most

563
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,440
active ransomware families that

564
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,760
we observed are shown on the

565
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
provided

566
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,559
sometimes but but pretty seldom we see

567
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,760
like

568
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,559
um

569
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,600
algorithms still but not from the

570
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,559
famous

571
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,760
like old rebel mesa or and so on so

572
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,600
mostly it is

573
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,320
for

574
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
new gamers in this game

575
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
uh typically uh two

576
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
factors forced weapons to pay ransomware

577
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,280
operators

578
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,720
first was that companies had no backups

579
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,440
to recover encrypted crit data

580
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,840
uh and the second was that sensitive

581
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,880
data was actually and could be published

582
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,000
online

583
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,799
uh

584
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,720
i can say like

585
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,559
of them uh

586
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,880
i mean third third

587
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,600
[Music]

588
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,960
factor is

589
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,679
to collect the data which

590
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,880
they

591
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,080
lost

592
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,159
because of this attack

593
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,960
but it's pretty similar to the first one

594
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
although there were many public

595
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
ransomware service

596
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,919
programs and some groups didn't see

597
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,640
or didn't use didn't use ransomware as

598
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
part of their disruptive attacks instead

599
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,559
they used built-in tools designed for

600
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,799
full disk encryption such as

601
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,279
widely known bit locker or open source

602
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,679
tools like this crypto

603
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,320
so again legal instruments during the

604
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,159
illegal attacks

605
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,400
um

606
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
based on like group by these

607
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,480
observations of the ransomware threat

608
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,400
landscape

609
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,080
we have compiled

610
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,360
[Music]

611
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
the following list of tips for threat

612
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,640
detections uh and hunting inside the

613
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,679
network

614
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,080
uh here are just some of them uh it had

615
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,039
to be

616
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,919
really huge list but if you want to know

617
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,400
how to prevent further infections focus

618
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
on the detection tips or get the

619
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,360
complete guide to the light

620
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,520
latest tactics techniques and procedures

621
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,080
of ransomware

622
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,400
operators and groups based on miter

623
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,679
attack

624
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,840
request the

625
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,320
ransomware uncovered by the

626
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,799
code on the last page or by the link

627
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,000
here

628
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,679
it it cost so

629
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,600
to read this

630
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,720
report

631
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,440
so

632
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,320
tips here are not so

633
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,039
uh deep technical uh

634
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,880
but you still can see that uh they're

635
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,840
pretty pretty useful to

636
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,279
at least check uh all your internal

637
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,919
infrastructures and computers

638
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,520
uh here uh

639
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,840
windows based but

640
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,240
as i said it doesn't matter because

641
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,039
sometimes linux based machines

642
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,840
are vulnerable for these two

643
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,960
um

644
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,080
so

645
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
i think that's all from my side uh if

646
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
you have any questions you can ask them

647
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,840
all right now

648
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,360
in the chat or

649
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,840
you can an email to kalina that is my

650
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,720
surname at group ibm.com

651
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,840
uh you can find me in a linkedin

652
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,159
on twitter you can do the same uh

653
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
so i think that's all from my second

654
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,600
let's go back to the studio
