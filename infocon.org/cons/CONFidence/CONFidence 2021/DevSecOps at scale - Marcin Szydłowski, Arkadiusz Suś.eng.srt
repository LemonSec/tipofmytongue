1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,559
good morning ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,200
welcome to our presentation uh my name

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,480
is arkady sush and martin schwarzky is

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,560
today with me and we're going to be

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,359
talking today about how to survive how

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,320
it is to live in the large organization

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,000
as definitely pmi is that kind of of a

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,720
company so the agenda is super simple

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,439
after short introduction of us and the

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,520
organization will try to explain what we

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,559
do there for a living will also unhide

12
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,760
the the secrets is if the if is there

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,600
any click-wide in this presentation and

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,640
why

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,879
however the main focus for us is to walk

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,840
you through the different challenges uh

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
we have spent some time in march in

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,719
disputing and selecting them carefully

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,199
some of you might say stupidly some of

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,840
you will say it's short it's not

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,960
completed and probably all of you are

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,760
right however we have deliberately

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,400
chosen those five points as as we

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,880
believe is the biggest pain in the neck

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,050
and neck for us in in such a big

26
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,240
[Music]

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,600
environment

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,040
so marcin if you could introduce

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,200
yourself yeah sure uh so hi my name is

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,920
martin chubowski uh on the internet you

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,960
can

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
see my twitter account and medium

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,360
account i'm using securityqsl handle

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,000
so my head of application systems with

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,640
pmi so basically myself and my team we

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
are trying to make sure that

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,920
all the systems in the company are

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,040
secure

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
uh i worked instead of security concerns

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,520
where i did a lot of fantastic exercises

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,840
and so on but now i'm focusing mostly on

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,040
the defensive part of security i'm also

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,000
hunting

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
bucks in the free time a member of

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,399
synagogue team and i also

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,560
do some let's say private research so

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,320
it's my first time in confidence as a

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
speaker but first i'm representing the

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,320
company i work in

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,360
and together with me i have alec

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,920
so the joke for today's presentation is

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,479
how you can spot a pilot at the party

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,479
and the answer to that is that pilot

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,318
will tell it's by himself right so it's

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
exactly the case with eric because he

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
will introduce himself and give some

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
info about his background by the way i

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
brought another job thanks marching for

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,879
a short intro so usually so as you know

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,360
we work for for emi it's like huge

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,879
international components so we are

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,640
dealing with the colleagues from all

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,000
over the world

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,720
and if we try to introduce ourselves

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
like a cabbage social machine

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
it sounds like fully encrypted highly

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,280
encrypted language to everyone so that's

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
the joke number joke number two and what

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
i do at pmi so i'm a head of sap

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,560
information security uh my ultimate goal

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,879
is puts if it's feasible the scp under

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,519
the force field and you know protected

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,599
from that guys trying to break in and

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,319
steal our top secrets

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,519
uh

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,159
on top of that i'm the item another big

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,800
fan of sap technology with 20 plus years

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,480
of experience on both sides on the

79
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,920
consulting side and of the customer side

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
of the of the force

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
so who we are who we are

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
someone said pmi is like a big

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,519
like a big animal like a elephant it's

84
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,159
it's big it's powerful it's not super

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,879
fast it might hurt you but it's also

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,120
scarce from time to time of the of the

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
mice so

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,720
you can see the figures on the screen uh

89
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,799
71 plus thousand full-time employees

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,599
spread all over the world plus about 40

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,000
000 of part-time

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,760
part-time jobs contractors interns

93
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
temporary workers via ranch stats of the

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,840
world

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,720
and of course our colleagues from from

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
from the vendor side so all together we

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,760
are we are the component of more than

98
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,480
one hundred thousand uh people

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
and we are spread all over the world we

100
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,640
are having uh more than one hundred

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200
locations in different countries

102
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,640
in krakow we have attracted more than

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,319
300 super talented experts with

104
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,920
everything feeling here in krakow from

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
writing code

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,760
we have service managers we have support

107
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,839
managers we have

108
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,759
project managers

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
we run big data we are on security

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,040
everything which enables

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
quite a modern conversation as pmis is

112
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,000
here located in krakow

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
i was especially proud of the farm that

114
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,479
we have received equal salary

115
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,479
certificate as a first big organization

116
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,720
in poland which means

117
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,479
we are paying equally based on

118
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,320
performance and capabilities to men

119
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
women regardless of

120
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,919
gender sex

121
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,240
orientation

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
ethnicity age

123
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,960
core of the scheme so we are the first

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,199
component to to have this

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,800
certificate

126
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,280
and 33 percent writing position is held

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,440
by women so we are quite interface

128
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,919
diverse or organization

129
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,720
and nine departments you can read

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,199
them from the screen and by the way

131
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,639
though those coins you can see on the

132
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,840
screen are not moderately real pmi

133
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
employees

134
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
think about a slightly different

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
perspective because that was an

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,400
introduction to the company but now i

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
would like to give you a short

138
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
introduction about the

139
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,080
um the technical ecosystem that we live

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
in because usually when you think of a

141
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
big company the first thing that you

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
will try to do this will probably go to

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the internet and search for for

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
so-called

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
to try to identify what are the publicly

146
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,039
available applications of that company

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,800
and based on that you will try to

148
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
estimate the company size and the

149
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
company digital footprint right

150
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,759
and probably you can do the same in our

151
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,240
case the thing is that if you go to

152
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,400
internet and you will try to find some

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,120
information on about us we will probably

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
find some informative pages you can find

155
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,280
some e-commerce web pages and so on

156
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,400
the thing is and our focus point as well

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,199
is that apart from this

158
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
applications which are available for

159
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,319
everyone we have literally thousands of

160
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
internal applications which needs to be

161
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,319
protected as well

162
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,880
so again from external point of view you

163
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,840
can see

164
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,479
e-commerce applications which are there

165
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,080
but what is really

166
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
interesting is what we have internally

167
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
because we have like applications for

168
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
research for operations logistics

169
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
finance applications

170
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,039
applications related to some hr

171
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,319
processes

172
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,520
so

173
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,280
there is a small zoo

174
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,960
when it comes to our internal systems

175
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,639
because obviously you have different

176
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,039
technologies different vendors

177
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,440
and different systems that you need to

178
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
to properly secure so obviously some of

179
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
them are more standardized like for

180
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,800
example sap that alex is going to tell

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
us about but some of them are

182
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,800
let's say

183
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,039
completely different introduced by a

184
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,639
large group of people

185
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
uh over the last for example 20 years

186
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,919
right so again if you've worked in some

187
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,759
global organization that's probably

188
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,280
something which is

189
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
quite familiar to you uh but if you've

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
never worked in in such a large

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
organization uh yes that's the reality

192
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
right so you have hundreds of systems

193
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
but all around the world in different

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,160
technologies and obviously they all need

195
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,800
to be secured

196
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,599
uh so

197
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,680
a bit our about our role and the

198
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
challenges that we are facing so last

199
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,759
slide when it comes to the into and then

200
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
we are jumping to the actual content

201
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,160
so

202
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,720
again talking about this devsecops thing

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,599
so

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,919
coming back to adam's question from from

205
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,919
the beginning of the presentation

206
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,720
so

207
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
again as you know we have some of the

208
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,160
passwords and some of the phrases which

209
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,800
are quite recognized across the industry

210
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
so just to name a few is devsecops

211
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,080
recently zero trust or cyber resilience

212
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,759
we are also talking a lot about pushing

213
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,120
security left

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
the problem is that these phrases are

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,520
quite inspirational but they are not

216
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,240
very well defined so again even if you

217
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,800
go to white papers of zeratus security

218
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,759
it just gives you some idea what

219
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,240
what do you want to achieve in the end

220
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,319
but it's not giving you a very detailed

221
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,160
way of how to get there

222
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,240
similarly with dextech ops right if you

223
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,919
start looking for the sec ops probably

224
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,000
you will find a lot of articles about

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,559
tools like sas and dust and other tools

226
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,159
which you can embed into your product

227
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,000
lifecycle to make it secure

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,800
the problem is that on the

229
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
other side of this equation you have a

230
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,839
lot of people who are engineers who are

231
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,600
modeling down to earth and they are

232
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,399
looking for some answers to

233
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
the problems they are facing right so

234
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
they don't want to hear about death

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
cecops anymore because it's not very

236
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,399
appealing to them

237
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,760
they would let another like to

238
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
understand what they need to do to make

239
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,600
the application secure how they should

240
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,920
configure their tools um what

241
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,200
programming language they should be

242
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,760
using i don't know are they content with

243
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
all the requirements and so on

244
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,399
so the role of myself and alec in this

245
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,120
company is trying to bridge the gap

246
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,440
between between these high-level

247
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
inspirational buzzwords or or

248
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,240
catchphrases and between these engineers

249
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
who in the end needs to secure the

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
system and make that make them complain

251
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
before the regulations however does my

252
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
comment much into what you have just

253
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,720
said uh related to to playing

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,600
development translators or maybe the

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,519
middleware interfaces

256
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,839
because uh i know it sounds obvious i

257
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,760
know it seems like a cliche but i

258
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
believe it is worth to underline again

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,240
and again so we need to find our

260
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
communication these are the

261
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,880
respective stakeholder or internal

262
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,839
cutoff for example usually when it comes

263
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
to

264
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,959
security or

265
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,880
requirements if you ask

266
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
let's say financial vp what is he

267
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
interested in what he would like to take

268
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
out of his system

269
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,279
he or she will reply i'm rather focused

270
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,839
or interested to see the integrated

271
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,360
finance reporting for the whole

272
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,800
financial group

273
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,680
however if you ask an i.t specialist or

274
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,480
security expert what he is interested in

275
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
and what he would like to explain he

276
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,680
will tell you about cross-site scripting

277
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,760
sql injections so we need to be very

278
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,880
careful

279
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
tailoring our communication for the

280
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,880
respective respective people we talked

281
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
to yeah

282
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,480
yeah and i will go for today since we

283
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,279
are in a technical conference we want to

284
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,360
to adjust the message so hopefully you

285
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,640
will be able to

286
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
uh to get some learnings out of this

287
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,800
presentation which you can also

288
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
implement in your company or at least

289
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,519
you know

290
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,920
uh think of it as some potential uh

291
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
let's say when that you would like to go

292
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
uh one important thing on the slide uh

293
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
is what are our main challenges so i

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
think that you know

295
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
if we think about the root cause of the

296
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
challenges we are having this is

297
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
probably scale so as i mentioned in the

298
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
previous slide at pmi we are talking

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,920
about hundreds of thousands of systems

300
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,120
right so again and by system we mean

301
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,959
something which runs on top of some

302
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,360
infrastructure so in reality we can we

303
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,279
are talking about thousands of servers

304
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,560
or some

305
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,880
system components which you can have in

306
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,000
place right

307
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
so again

308
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
uh what we've listed here is some

309
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,399
challenges which are a result of huge

310
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,760
scale so

311
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
robustness of technologies security

312
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
versus agility awareness visibility and

313
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,200
technical depth and what we are going to

314
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
do now we are going to deep dive in each

315
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,560
of these

316
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
challenges we are going to tell you a

317
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
bit more about why we believe they are

318
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,720
problematic

319
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,000
and we are

320
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200
going to to to tell you what are the

321
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
possible solutions

322
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
so maybe

323
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
let me revert back to this line because

324
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
a comment fell into my mind to this one

325
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
so we will try to be as open as we can

326
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
we'll try to be as specific as we can

327
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,560
but anyway you need to excuse me excuse

328
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
us the sound that we will go

329
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
not

330
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
that sometimes we will not get into the

331
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,079
into the details of the systems due to

332
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,320
well security reasons so just for fyi

333
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
yeah so when it comes how you should use

334
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
that presentation again this

335
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
presentation is definitely not a pmi

336
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,639
cyber security program it's neither pmi

337
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,560
application security program or it's

338
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
neither pmi's opinions or cyber security

339
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
or any other topic right

340
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,399
uh however

341
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,519
uh

342
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,200
we would like it not to be another

343
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,760
corporate slide deck so we still want to

344
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,240
share some technical information and

345
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,920
obviously we'll be very open to any

346
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,079
questions so what this presentation is

347
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,720
about so as i stated here we are just

348
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,519
two security guys trying to share what

349
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,040
what is going

350
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,000
well in our organization what work not

351
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,279
so well

352
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,959
what are the areas we are still

353
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,279
struggling and with and then what she

354
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,360
said is you usually like the size and

355
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,160
the complexity of the organization again

356
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,079
because it's a technical conference we

357
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,399
will try to get down to earth as much as

358
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,240
as we can and we'll share tips and

359
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
tricks that we can start using in your

360
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,839
organization just just afterwards

361
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,320
so challenge number one and no so you

362
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,000
have to know what needs to be protected

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,839
again songs of the cliche sounds like

364
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,480
the obvious part even the size of the

365
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,720
organization we are dealing with two

366
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,639
streams of this challenge visibility

367
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,480
criticality and control

368
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,720
so in the silence of visibility we are

369
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,920
asking ourselves very often do we see

370
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,800
all the systems are we aware about all

371
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
applications existing and the answer is

372
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,160
uh

373
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
yes to some extent

374
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
because we are striking heavily with

375
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
something that is called shadow ideas so

376
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,839
shadow yt is the operation project

377
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,399
of different solutions

378
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,040
without formal approval and without even

379
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,399
knowledge of

380
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,839
of i.t

381
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,399
and why is that feasible at all

382
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
because of the size of the organization

383
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,880
with having more than 100 affiliates we

384
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,279
cannot control to the full extent every

385
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,600
behavior of every business function of

386
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,120
every

387
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,240
in all those 100 countries so to fulfill

388
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
their local needs very often

389
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,959
teams decided to go with the local

390
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,519
solutions and to implement this fast and

391
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,079
hustle free they

392
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,440
they miss or work around work around it

393
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
that's one of the alignments

394
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,399
second

395
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,600
second

396
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
part of this challenge second side of

397
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,680
this challenge is

398
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,560
that

399
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,839
we in the era of uh cloud

400
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,320
systems of solutions is super easy to

401
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,720
buy the solution by yourself you find

402
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,959
something that is fit for your purpose

403
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,959
you find it as a sas

404
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,720
you pay with your credit card you

405
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
expense it and that's it and you upload

406
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,279
some very often critical or important

407
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,279
data into the cloud

408
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,600
without proper attention to security

409
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,519
sometimes to

410
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,079
also to vendors that are not uh super

411
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,399
equitable on the market so

412
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,320
what we can do about that apart from

413
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,279
bringing

414
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,600
building awareness uh we are fighting

415
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,399
against this shuttle righty with cmdb

416
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,600
sounds obvious but having this database

417
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,040
up to date

418
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,839
with the more than 1000

419
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,639
different systems is a challenge on its

420
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,120
own there's plenty dozens of people

421
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,079
who are obliged to to keep it up to date

422
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,399
but sometimes we are human sometimes we

423
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,680
fail so cmdb is the ultimate solution

424
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,360
much you will be talking about dynamic

425
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,480
cmdb that make this life a little bit

426
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
easier another element is

427
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,440
cusp solution cloud application security

428
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
broker it is a

429
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
type of the interface between the user

430
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,480
and

431
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,839
sys and cloud and cloud solutions

432
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,639
usually it applies to all type of cloud

433
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,839
services however apart from

434
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,320
the fact that cusp can help us to apply

435
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
different security policies it also

436
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,519
provides visibility about who is

437
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,800
using what

438
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,880
and also help us to prevent uncontrolled

439
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,680
usage however there is also a

440
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
bureaucratic or

441
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,480
process

442
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,839
oriented way to deal with shadow id

443
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,360
which is

444
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,440
to seal the procurement process so we

445
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,519
are trying to make sure that

446
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,160
if someone is buying a solution there's

447
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,199
always a nike person on the label

448
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,959
in part of the process

449
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,639
who is not only helping to select the

450
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,040
proper one or in line with the

451
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,480
regulations but also reminds about the

452
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,320
importance of security

453
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,040
payment process if you buy your solution

454
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,440
access to the cloud-based system with

455
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,359
your credit card and

456
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,400
we

457
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,280
might

458
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,039
we might monitor it

459
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,119
on the payment side

460
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,039
so if you spot it or someone is paying

461
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,799
for for the web app

462
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,319
then it triggers action to investigate

463
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,799
and explain why it's not happening

464
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,439
criticality is another dimension we are

465
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,039
asking ourselves again what makes

466
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,480
application critical and there are

467
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,599
different

468
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,039
different ways of assessing criticality

469
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,960
there are different dimensions and it's

470
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,080
not black black and white for some

471
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
business colleagues some systems are

472
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,559
super important even though they are

473
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,400
relatively safe because they are put

474
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,559
behind the firewalls and the surface of

475
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,679
attack is minimized for other teams even

476
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,520
if they implement super complex solution

477
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,559
internet facing they try to cut corners

478
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,840
they're trying to speed up the

479
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,559
implementation so they try to

480
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,960
persuade us that

481
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
severity and criticality of the solution

482
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,840
is lower than east because with the

483
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,720
higher criticality is the more

484
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,080
you know

485
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,840
the resources and time and controls are

486
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,320
spent to ensure the proper security when

487
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
it comes to controls machine maybe you

488
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,559
will explain to the early control

489
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,320
changes yeah i think it's also important

490
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,720
to mention regarding criticality about

491
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,280
the solution right so again

492
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,840
it's important to understand what is the

493
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
criticality of the solution let's say by

494
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
the book by having a proper criticality

495
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
classes or what however you define

496
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
uh solution criticality however what

497
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,400
worked for us pretty well

498
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,720
is that it's not the only criteria when

499
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
we are deciding on security checks which

500
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,799
needs to be performed so for example if

501
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,559
we see that there is something which

502
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,960
theoretically is not critical solution

503
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
but it's for example internet facing or

504
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,760
it has a large group of users using it

505
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,360
obviously we'll do some additional

506
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,520
checks right so i think the lessons

507
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,480
known for for us it's not to rely only

508
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
on this

509
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,320
criticality class which was defined by

510
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,520
by some colleagues because it's not

511
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,919
always black and white but also to

512
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,520
just take that extra step and understand

513
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
the entire system

514
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
when it comes to the last part so about

515
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,960
the control and about controlling the

516
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,880
changes

517
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,039
it's a bit related to visibility what i

518
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,600
have mentioned in the beginning but

519
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
when i was thinking about this point

520
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,640
what i had

521
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
specifically in mind is cloud

522
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,120
infrastructure more and more companies

523
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
are going toward cloud infrastructure so

524
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,360
again aws gcp agile or some other local

525
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
providers in a given region so obviously

526
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
when i was saying that in software as a

527
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,840
service is extremely easy to purchase a

528
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,799
solution credit card when you are having

529
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,360
infrastructure as a service obviously

530
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,480
it's easy to spin up a new server right

531
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
obviously we can discuss

532
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
what's your organization risk appetite

533
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,159
and if you would like to allow people to

534
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,480
do that or not but still the thing is

535
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
that they can probably

536
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,280
create new resources relatively easy or

537
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,520
the path is shorter than it used to be

538
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,640
before

539
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
so again

540
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
our answer to that challenge would be

541
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,720
some well established dynamics cmdb

542
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
right so with cloud resources the good

543
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
thing is they have first of all they

544
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,200
have some

545
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,640
services which are available which you

546
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
can use to get the current list of your

547
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
assets but if you have some reasonable

548
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
packing strategy you can also pretty

549
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
easily

550
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
link them so you can easily understand

551
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,159
if any new services or new servers are

552
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,159
popping up when it comes to some

553
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,720
specific uh system you have in place

554
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
obviously you can also use some other

555
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
ways to do the same thing so you can use

556
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,159
some scanning tools which will

557
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
constantly monitor

558
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,840
your systems

559
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,039
jumping directly to challenge 2 which is

560
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,000
a lack of understanding

561
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
the problem

562
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,919
because the thing is that you have a lot

563
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,480
of challenges with so-called system

564
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,880
security requirements because obviously

565
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,400
the first question is what is a

566
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
system right

567
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,480
so again and what is the system security

568
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,159
uh because if you ask me that question i

569
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,159
can come up to you with a list of

570
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,880
requirements on any given level so as

571
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,280
you can see here we have like 80 domains

572
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,360
but probably is not the full least that

573
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,640
you should take care of when you're

574
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
implementing your system so again

575
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
network security application security

576
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,039
access management just to name a few but

577
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,760
realistically speaking this list can be

578
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,080
can be way bigger than that

579
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,720
and the thing is that you know if you go

580
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,760
to colleagues in it department and if

581
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
you tell them for example that they need

582
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,559
to introduce password policy they fully

583
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,240
understand it and they fully understand

584
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,840
what is the goal of that

585
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,440
however if you are asking them a

586
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,960
different question of if you are

587
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,760
requiring them for example to use

588
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,360
one signing algorithm

589
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
other than some other one

590
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,360
they start to raise questions right

591
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,520
because they don't understand it and the

592
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,240
thing is that if you want your security

593
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,320
program to work you need to spend some

594
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,000
time to explain

595
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,679
that to your colleagues why they need to

596
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,320
do certain things why is that because

597
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
simply from our experience we can see

598
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
that engineers and architects

599
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
they like to understand

600
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,559
why they need to do certain things

601
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,679
it just allows them to think of it

602
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,760
and also to plan the implementation

603
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,080
better

604
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,320
again what is our solution i think it's

605
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,440
not a one simple answer but i think that

606
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,840
just to make your life and others life a

607
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
bit easier

608
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,760
uh

609
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,679
one important lesson for us is that you

610
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
should make people's lives easier so i

611
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,880
think it's a bit it might be a bit hard

612
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,520
for some of the organizations

613
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,640
uh but i think that you know if we are

614
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,799
already talking about devsecops so you

615
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,840
know the

616
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,960
this you know

617
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,640
wonderful place where everyone is

618
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,320
cooperating with all the other people

619
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
and we are working towards one common

620
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,640
goal

621
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
you just may need to make people's lives

622
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,679
simpler right so it's it's your job as

623
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,640
security officer to adjust your tools

624
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
and adjust your processes in such a way

625
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,360
that other people can can easily use

626
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,799
your tools right so again uh

627
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,600
just to name a few ideas maybe some some

628
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,919
technical ones if you can create some

629
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,679
libraries or if you can create some

630
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,240
templates which can be easily consumed

631
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,480
by colleagues in other teams by software

632
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
engineers by architects which they can

633
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
pretty much use right away

634
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
that will help a lot right and i'm not

635
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
talking here about

636
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,360
documents i'm not talking about

637
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,039
documentation i'm thinking more about

638
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,600
libraries about about images which are

639
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,440
ready to use about container images

640
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,200
which are ready to use

641
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,159
telephone templates whatever right so

642
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,640
in general i think it's quite important

643
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,960
to make other people live easier answer

644
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,039
to the questions right away and just

645
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,480
making security a bit more and digestive

646
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,799
for them

647
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,679
second important point represented here

648
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,520
by the lion and the sun is top

649
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
management support unfortunately it's

650
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,480
something we just usually have limited

651
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,400
influence to however this is the

652
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,000
absolutely critical uh success part of

653
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,080
for the security

654
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,559
or the devsecops concept so without the

655
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,279
strong sisa with all this

656
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,480
strong see so we can forget about having

657
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
this concept put in life there are

658
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,640
different reasons for that first of all

659
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
this is the person who helped to build a

660
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,840
role information security role for the

661
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,080
organization he is there to communicate

662
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,559
the the security practices provides

663
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,840
budgets and resources for your security

664
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,320
oriented actions however

665
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,640
also management support is required to

666
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,440
setting up the priorities and solving

667
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,200
conflict let me give the example of the

668
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,720
very known triangle of

669
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,039
security person project manager and

670
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,919
support manager so they are helping the

671
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,080
three of those guys might have

672
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,520
completely different preferences and

673
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,480
contradictory

674
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,120
expectations for example project manager

675
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,799
is usually focused to deliver the

676
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,720
solution as fast as he's able to bring

677
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,000
mvp to that of the business so he is he

678
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,720
or she is not super excited of having

679
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
additional work related to security

680
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,480
because it will impact the project

681
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,000
timeline and

682
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,320
and resource that will cost money

683
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,200
when it comes comes to support teams or

684
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,919
service manager that person is usually

685
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,960
focused on keeping the total cost of

686
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,279
ownership of the service as long as

687
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,240
feasible so for him

688
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,520
on one hand

689
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,200
it is a very tough role because on one

690
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,640
hand this person would like to have a

691
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
super secure solution with no

692
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,400
data breach on the other hand uh

693
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,840
he would like to have the tco as long as

694
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,200
as possible

695
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,000
so this person might have a different

696
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
perspective and different expectations

697
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,960
from from you so so from the security

698
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,279
guys so it happens often that

699
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,760
that some controls are not put as

700
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,559
the first priority the third element of

701
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,039
equation security guys we we all would

702
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,320
like to keep systems under umbrella have

703
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,400
them secured up to date

704
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
and bulletproof however that comes with

705
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,799
resources and money so so we need uh

706
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,240
someone a judge to help us with uh

707
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
solving those conflicts and setting up

708
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,480
the cleat path and that's where top

709
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,799
management support is essential and very

710
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,840
handy

711
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,600
yeah and on top of that i think it is

712
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
you know it's quite important as well

713
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,919
that top management can simply

714
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,559
discuss between themselves but in the

715
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,480
end we are still going for one common

716
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,440
goal

717
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,600
and so security should be obviously not

718
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,840
be treated as a

719
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,640
as something you need to add on top but

720
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,559
it just seems needs to be there

721
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,320
because it's it's one of the factor

722
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,080
which which makes your solution more

723
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,159
complete right and more resilient as

724
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,360
they call it

725
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,720
uh

726
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,600
security awareness program but just with

727
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,760
a small remark it's security awareness

728
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,200
program for it

729
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
so we are not talking anymore about the

730
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,799
situation when you are just sending

731
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,559
communication to the entire company that

732
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,480
they need to change the password because

733
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,720
it is not what we are talking about here

734
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,880
here we are talking about some very

735
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,360
specific awareness program which is

736
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,760
targeting people from the company

737
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,919
responsible for engineering and

738
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,399
architecture areas

739
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,559
why is that again coming back to my

740
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,480
previous slide

741
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,640
engineers they would like to understand

742
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,480
why they need to do some things right

743
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,320
and obviously if you can give them some

744
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,600
examples

745
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,520
why they need to do certain things it

746
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,720
will be

747
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,440
more understandable for them to

748
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,320
and

749
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
as a result they will be more keen to

750
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,559
implementing these things right so what

751
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,960
we what we did in our company what

752
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,000
worked for us pretty well uh is we did a

753
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,760
lot of this let's say awareness

754
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,919
activities so some webinars some

755
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,000
articles capture the fact competitions

756
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,240
and spamming corporate social media

757
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,520
and so basically whenever we saw that

758
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
multiple teams are having some problem

759
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,159
regarding some technology or some

760
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,320
security feature we just decided to

761
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,919
write an article on that and this

762
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,399
articles were written in such a way that

763
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,440
all our colleagues who

764
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,360
who are using for example these tools or

765
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,120
who needs to use that particular

766
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,679
technique can really understand what is

767
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,640
behind

768
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,880
so again one idea and one of common

769
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,799
problem that we see

770
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,120
that we that we've seen in the past is

771
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,600
that regarding let's say application

772
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,000
security testing so people don't really

773
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,559
understand why they need to do

774
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,480
static application security testing

775
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,200
dynamic one software component analysis

776
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,760
container security and pen test on top

777
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,440
right so if you are telling them that

778
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,360
they need to do five activities

779
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
regarding security testing obviously it

780
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,360
will raise a lot of questions why they

781
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,480
need to do it

782
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,159
but if you explain them what is the

783
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,200
difference between all of the

784
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
the the the tools or the activities and

785
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,600
if you explain them

786
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,520
what is the idea behind

787
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,360
i think again it will be more

788
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,399
understandable for them

789
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,840
so

790
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,000
the challenge number three so minor

791
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
overlooks that might bring

792
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,440
critical consequences to the

793
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,799
organization

794
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,200
uh i would this particular part i would

795
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,840
exemplify based on security of sap

796
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,159
systems so uh

797
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,000
there are few challenges the first one

798
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,720
is

799
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,840
we are lacking by we are referring to

800
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,600
the uh all employees of all big

801
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
organizations we are very often lacking

802
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
the holistic security on a specific

803
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,399
solution so either we focus on infra

804
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,120
security or we focus on the application

805
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,320
of our authorization concept but it's

806
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
not the

807
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,880
best well it's not a fully established

808
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,559
standard but we are always looking at

809
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,279
the other systems from the 360

810
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,000
perspective and giving the size and

811
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,679
scale of the organization that might

812
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,919
lead to the tragic consequences so

813
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,799
for example sap

814
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,200
so to exemplify this magnitude of that

815
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,159
problem we are having about 100 systems

816
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,559
of sap systems of pmi

817
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,399
every of those systems

818
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,159
has a full landscape which is

819
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,120
development test production report and

820
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,240
regression tests and regression uh

821
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,120
systems so we multiplied by five every

822
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,120
of those systems like products and you

823
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,760
name it resides on a lot of

824
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,159
infrastructure there is a application

825
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,080
server there's a database server there

826
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,879
are also few

827
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,519
systems for local so all in all if you

828
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,279
it by

829
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,120
if to make this equation

830
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,080
you will end up with more than 1 000

831
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,960
servers entities on which sap system

832
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,000
resides so if you make an error in your

833
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,240
if you don't apply properly your

834
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,919
security baseline then you create

835
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,640
a gap a vulnerability that is multiplied

836
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,120
thousand times and of course the surface

837
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,200
or attack is enormous

838
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,240
so for example when i have spoken to

839
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,080
many peoples about the sap security the

840
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,120
first

841
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,360
topic which came to their mind is

842
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,080
usually authorization so authorization

843
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,200
concept

844
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,440
may be checking the configuration but to

845
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,360
be honest that's it

846
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,080
and especially in the i would say era of

847
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,760
clouds and

848
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,320
internet present solutions

849
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,519
sap systems become

850
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,240
very prone to hackers for a different

851
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,679
reason we have them on the screen so

852
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,960
first of all

853
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,000
uh sap systems are

854
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,240
dealing with the top

855
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,320
business processes in the organization

856
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,559
from finance from keeping general ledger

857
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,760
through sales to up to i don't know

858
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,480
business business are analytics so for

859
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,600
example pmi stores the secret formula of

860
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,799
mobile within the sap system so highly

861
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,960
critical and very sensitive data are

862
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,480
starts there

863
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,399
the crown jewels of the organization

864
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,200
data are usually stored in the sap sap

865
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,320
systems

866
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,799
at pmi but also in majority of the

867
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,399
similar sites or organizations so for

868
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,320
the attacker

869
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,559
it's just worth to take a look at the

870
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,600
sap

871
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
system that's one element second

872
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,640
implement large attack area

873
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,760
as i have explained 1000 systems 1000

874
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,320
servers from on which you can start

875
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,559
hunting for

876
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,279
vulnerabilities

877
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,679
plus the internet presence even

878
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,960
though systems of uh own business are

879
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,399
not always exposed directly to uh to

880
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,840
internet they are very often

881
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
interconnected so for example the big

882
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,000
one of the big systems pmi more than

883
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,440
5000

884
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,960
interfaces

885
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,919
so again it's super easy maybe not super

886
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,600
easy it's tempting to to try attack the

887
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,799
sap system and the average cost of

888
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,440
security breach for sap system is

889
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,679
estimated as 5 million dollars per up

890
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,960
lack of cyber security

891
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,080
sap systems exist or in general erp

892
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,399
system exists for like 15 or 20 years

893
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,480
already on the market so they have been

894
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,840
installed very

895
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,720
you know like 15 years ago and they are

896
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,200
keeping and carrying a lot of security

897
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,120
and technical depth

898
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,039
in the again

899
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,600
before the digital revolution came into

900
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,279
the into their play

901
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,600
uh i.t systems very often were

902
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,880
considered as costs so they have been

903
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,399
a strong push to diminish to lower the

904
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,000
tco so

905
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,119
investing in

906
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,079
stop investing in security was

907
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,800
a very tempting thing to do

908
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,679
and also very often sap because of this

909
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,918
uniqueness and differences have

910
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,480
separate teams who are not necessarily

911
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,280
equipped to the exact standard with

912
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,520
the security knowledge and also the

913
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,760
security was not always the priority for

914
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,320
them so changing the mindset is created

915
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,480
up so

916
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,280
to make this story short people

917
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,918
are very often trying to bridge into the

918
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,879
sap systems and after them so what we

919
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,040
can do about that

920
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,440
we have developed a program on pmi that

921
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,320
is called sap360 that

922
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
consists of

923
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
looking at the system from different

924
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,800
perspectives so we are verifying the

925
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,119
security of the physical resources we

926
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,640
are thinking look at the on the

927
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,440
operating system and data data database

928
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,520
security we are of course putting a lot

929
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,680
of attention and focus on the

930
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,440
application layer

931
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,680
however we don't forget about it and

932
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,119
please you don't forget about the

933
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,920
element like the proper segmentation on

934
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,480
the network or securing your interfaces

935
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,640
it's absolutely essential

936
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,359
so below the on the screen you see 16

937
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,200
squares i don't want to go through them

938
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,880
one by one however i would like to

939
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,280
tell you that in order to have nowadays

940
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,839
to have this sap system secure

941
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,839
you should look at it from different

942
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,560
perspective you should maybe buy your

943
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,280
alerting monitoring system that will

944
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,240
verify uh that will give you in real

945
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,079
time or near real time others about the

946
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,839
potential

947
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,680
either with configuration or potential

948
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,599
data breach you should put a lot of

949
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,680
attention for patch management i will be

950
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,760
explaining that in a minute

951
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,800
but also you should secure your security

952
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,720
and lead access lock into the lock

953
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,599
sentiment sentinel you should conduct

954
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,640
regular penetration testing for sap you

955
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,400
should not forget about securing

956
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,599
endpoint connectivity and interfaces

957
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,040
and the security expert experts for sap

958
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,480
are very rare i would say they are very

959
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,599
available

960
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,040
they are

961
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,560
species so

962
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,240
having them

963
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,720
on board is absolutely critical and

964
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,680
challenging tasks to achieve

965
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,000
yep so giving you some other examples

966
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,440
about my number of bulls with major

967
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,359
consequences

968
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,359
for this of you who are working more

969
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,119
with let's say

970
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,440
modern systems when you have a cisd

971
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,560
pipeline

972
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,440
and where you are building or deploying

973
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,480
software

974
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,839
automatically

975
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,320
probably you are familiar with cis

976
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,480
department configuration right so it's

977
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,720
it looks more or less what you can see

978
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,079
on the screen

979
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,079
so again uh

980
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,240
in general in the company we are trying

981
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
to make things as standard as possible

982
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,400
and we'll also get to that in a minute

983
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,079
but as you can imagine if we are talking

984
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,880
about 1000 systems and we

985
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,079
mess up a bit configuration of this cisd

986
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,119
pipeline or one

987
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,320
component of it we end up with 1000

988
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,400
systems which are insecure

989
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,160
so again here on the slide you can see

990
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,720
some of the threats it's coming from a

991
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
recently introduced standard which is

992
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,240
called salsa so again if you're

993
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,960
interested just give it a look but

994
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
what i mean by that what is some common

995
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,520
overlook is for example

996
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,040
allowing people to execute some code on

997
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,480
pull request

998
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,320
so again if you are

999
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,040
running pull requests on untrusted code

1000
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,359
it can has a lot of bad consequences

1001
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,720
later on

1002
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,960
it doesn't matter if it's your ci tool

1003
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,280
or is it a tool to deploy the the

1004
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
infrastructure but recently there were

1005
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,680
some real cases where this was not

1006
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,720
properly done and as a result anonymous

1007
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,400
people were able to

1008
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,560
execute some code even on production

1009
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
environment because of the for example

1010
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,480
in improper segregation between the

1011
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,640
environments so again

1012
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,359
my door overlooks because it's a simply

1013
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,520
little checkbox in the system

1014
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,359
leading to a situation where you have a

1015
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,960
vulnerability

1016
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,680
or a risk in in thousands of systems

1017
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,320
uh next thing is security versus agility

1018
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,680
and that is

1019
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,920
super important aspect right now so

1020
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,760
basically probably you know that

1021
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,400
currently everyone wants to move fast

1022
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,680
so we are

1023
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,400
not anymore in the in the moment of the

1024
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,800
history where people were releasing a

1025
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,040
software and every six months or 12

1026
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,359
months right now for most of the

1027
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,440
applications people want to release a

1028
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,280
new version every week or even more

1029
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,040
often

1030
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,079
in time

1031
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,200
it's

1032
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,280
quite unreasonable to expect that all of

1033
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,400
these people

1034
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,599
who work in these teams will be experts

1035
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,839
in cyber security and they would like to

1036
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,680
come up come back here to the site which

1037
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
i presented before so you know if you

1038
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,480
ask engineer how many characters should

1039
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,760
be there in a

1040
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,240
in a password probably every engineer

1041
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,480
will give you the correct answer

1042
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,320
but if you ask them a question how

1043
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,800
should they protect themselves about

1044
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,280
from sql injection or post-site skipping

1045
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,680
the answer is not that clear especially

1046
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,040
because as i said they are using

1047
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,240
different frameworks they are using

1048
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,760
different technologies

1049
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,119
so

1050
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,200
it's basically super hard for them to do

1051
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,720
it

1052
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,520
so

1053
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,200
maybe you've heard about this phrase

1054
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,440
from henry ford that any customer can

1055
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,160
have

1056
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,960
painted any color as long as it's black

1057
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,599
so we took a quite a similar approach so

1058
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,440
you know any team can use whatever

1059
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,200
lightweight architecture infrastructure

1060
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,359
modules as long as they are compliant

1061
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,720
with our standards which means they are

1062
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,079
secure

1063
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,200
so the

1064
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,040
obvious question would be what does

1065
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,320
secure mean

1066
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,040
so

1067
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,359
we wanted to introduce

1068
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,599
let's say concept of secure defaults it

1069
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,079
is quite a common concept i think you

1070
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,599
know it's quite

1071
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,079
widely published or there are a lot of

1072
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,000
articles on the internet about it but

1073
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,400
for organization of our size

1074
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,079
it's even more important than for these

1075
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,520
small companies because if you're a

1076
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,280
small company and you are dealing with

1077
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,880
two of these systems you can basically

1078
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,800
review all of the money one if you are

1079
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,480
dealing with one hundred or with one

1080
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,160
thousand systems

1081
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,160
it might be very hard to do the same

1082
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,800
thing manually so coming back to initial

1083
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,440
question devsecops our answer to

1084
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,599
devsecops would be rather to rely on

1085
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,839
secure defaults than trying to go into

1086
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,079
each and every pipeline and verify how

1087
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,920
many vulnerabilities and how many false

1088
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,079
positives they do have in their pipeline

1089
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,000
so again just to give you a few examples

1090
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,720
because these examples can be literally

1091
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,359
used to everything in the organization

1092
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,599
uh for example when you have cicd

1093
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,720
pipeline

1094
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,400
uh you can

1095
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,319
make a shared library or you can make a

1096
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,640
template which each and every team can

1097
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,040
use in their pipelines and this template

1098
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,119
will have security tools be configured

1099
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,000
in them

1100
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
so basically instead of relying on

1101
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
people that they would go to their

1102
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
pipeline and properly configure security

1103
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,319
tools within them you you're giving them

1104
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,480
let's say a module and you're asking

1105
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,640
them to embed into the acid pipeline

1106
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,160
right so obviously

1107
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,119
it's a bit easier for them same for

1108
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,800
scanning tools or you'll be configuring

1109
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,160
some policies

1110
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,400
but on the and in the other areas you

1111
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,560
can basically think about different ways

1112
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,160
to achieve itself

1113
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,280
so again if you are working on languages

1114
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,520
like c or c plus plus

1115
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
probably there is no good reason anymore

1116
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,920
to i mean okay there is a good reason to

1117
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,240
use them but for most of the use cases

1118
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,400
you can replace them with rust so the

1119
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
difference between rust and cnc plus

1120
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,000
plus is that last basically the way this

1121
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,560
language is built is that it allows you

1122
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,280
to avoid some vulnerabilities related to

1123
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,400
memory so it simply becomes easier for

1124
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,440
you similarly with some modern

1125
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
js frameworks

1126
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,920
so basically it's it's way more

1127
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,319
complicated for you to introduce

1128
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,480
excesses vulnerability if you use some

1129
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
of them for example i don't know react

1130
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,359
right

1131
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,720
uh same for cryptography so again it's

1132
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,160
unreasonable

1133
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,520
for for

1134
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,440
for software engineers to expect that

1135
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,839
software engineer will understand what

1136
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,599
cryptography is about actually

1137
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,560
cryptography is a piece of let's say

1138
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,040
security which is even

1139
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,000
hard for security engineers so you know

1140
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,920
i personally i don't know a lot of

1141
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,920
people who can really understand all of

1142
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,720
the

1143
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,119
uh technical layer of cryptography right

1144
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,880
so it's same for engineers it's

1145
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,480
unrealistic to expect that they will

1146
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,520
know that however there are some

1147
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,440
secular libraries to type cryptographic

1148
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,319
libraries which you can ask them to use

1149
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,160
so basically if you use team clay

1150
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,560
library it's a library created by google

1151
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
the chances that they will make a

1152
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,280
error in cryptography is way smaller

1153
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,520
simply because this library doesn't

1154
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,440
allow you to configure

1155
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,079
these things in a in an insecure way

1156
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,680
what about sap

1157
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,760
so we what we do we use pre-hardened

1158
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,160
server images we're trying to keep them

1159
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,359
up to date as much as we can so in order

1160
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,000
to install the new uh new system you

1161
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,800
install it from the iso image and the

1162
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,640
system is already patched and configured

1163
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,480
according to the baseline and here

1164
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,079
however i would like to revert back to

1165
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,839
this to this slide with the

1166
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,160
uh configuration pipeline so uh it is

1167
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,359
quite random a real rare thing still to

1168
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,119
incorporate security into the

1169
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,599
development life cycle of the sap system

1170
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,920
automatically however please bear in

1171
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,520
mind that there are there are solutions

1172
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,800
on the market and pmi we use one of them

1173
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,839
that

1174
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,920
provides or enforce using of uh code

1175
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,200
scanning of sas into the development

1176
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,680
life socket lifecycle also into the

1177
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,200
configuration so

1178
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,440
if there are a new code to be deployed

1179
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,680
you go through the automatic codes come

1180
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,640
it's maybe obvious however for above

1181
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,200
coders it's not the everyday practice

1182
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,680
unfortunately yet also when it comes to

1183
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,680
the critical security

1184
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,839
configuration it has to be approved so

1185
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,839
system does not allow to transport the

1186
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,599
changes without the foreign approval

1187
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,880
from the

1188
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,480
respective security officer

1189
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,359
okay so that's it and now we are

1190
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,079
let's say slowly going to the last slide

1191
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,240
of this presentation which is the last

1192
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,160
challenge is the next technical security

1193
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,119
debt

1194
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,640
so again as we said at the very

1195
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,400
beginning we have hundreds of systems

1196
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,079
they were introduced by people from all

1197
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
around the world uh

1198
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,079
sometimes with a lot of different

1199
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,359
companies we are using different

1200
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,680
technologies and so on so you know

1201
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,520
speaking from the technical perspective

1202
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,880
some of the systems probably should be

1203
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,200
already replaced with systems which use

1204
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,640
new technologies

1205
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,760
however

1206
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,599
the problem is that the system works

1207
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,280
just fine so from the business

1208
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,160
perspective it's really hard to tell our

1209
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,760
colleagues that they need to invest in

1210
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,440
new systems and probably invest a lot of

1211
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,920
money in a new system if the old ones

1212
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,800
would look works just well so obviously

1213
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,560
if they're critical vulnerabilities in

1214
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,280
the old systems it's easier to do that

1215
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,599
however if this system security posture

1216
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,440
is let's say on a

1217
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,640
reasonable

1218
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,560
reasonably good level which means there

1219
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,400
are some vulnerabilities but not very

1220
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,359
high

1221
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,920
it's it might be very hard to convince

1222
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,160
our colleagues to invest in a complete

1223
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,880
new system again i'm especially talking

1224
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,880
about the scale that we have here so we

1225
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,040
are talking about hundreds of systems

1226
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,599
uh so what would be our solution i think

1227
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,520
our solution will consist of

1228
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,839
two areas one is more organizational and

1229
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,920
the other is more technical so when it

1230
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,400
comes to organizational aspect

1231
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,359
the standard path to explore and verify

1232
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,720
the security health check of the

1233
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,440
existing and well established system is

1234
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,319
assess getting stay clean the process is

1235
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,640
to use some standard tools or some

1236
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,720
available tools to verify the security

1237
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,880
posture resolution and as the result you

1238
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,359
have the report so you know what the

1239
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,079
vulnerabilities are there so this part

1240
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,280
might be automatized to some extent and

1241
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,760
and it's relatively fast so if you come

1242
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,119
by even if you put on top of the

1243
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,440
penetration testing within two months

1244
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,480
you can understand the security

1245
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,359
posture of even very complex system

1246
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,000
however getting clean removing the

1247
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,040
security depth might take

1248
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,920
maybe not ages but at least years so

1249
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,960
again example from sap world the the

1250
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,920
complex and the big sap system can have

1251
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,079
like fifty thousand plus authorized

1252
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,000
different optimization different roles

1253
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,599
and components so

1254
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,440
to verify them

1255
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,319
to make to to verify to

1256
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,440
make sure that they are still needed to

1257
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,160
check all segregation of duty might take

1258
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,920
any years up one to two years

1259
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,400
fast and clean should be always

1260
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,720
automatized to the extent it is visible

1261
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,119
so alerting and monitoring solution plus

1262
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:21,920
yeah

1263
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,119
are very handy i put deliberately an

1264
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,800
additional bullet approach management

1265
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,880
process because for some legacy systems

1266
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,640
we cannot touch them anymore they went

1267
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,960
out of the support from the from the

1268
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,520
vendors of the producer however for

1269
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,359
others

1270
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,200
we need to be very careful about

1271
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,400
applying the proper and coherent patch

1272
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,800
management processes let me give you

1273
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,839
again one example from the sap so sap is

1274
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,680
very complex systems with plenty of

1275
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,720
modules

1276
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,400
sometimes not modules are being used so

1277
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,040
there is a temptation to not to

1278
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,359
implement patches to those not used

1279
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,359
models because of lack of knowledge

1280
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,400
because to cut corners to speed it up

1281
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,880
so we have discovered some

1282
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,640
systems that have not been passed for

1283
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,920
seven or ten years uh not completely but

1284
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,760
those unused

1285
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,359
business models

1286
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,599
have not been upgraded because there

1287
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,160
were very severe

1288
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,400
vulnerabilities there so

1289
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,160
be careful about patch management

1290
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,319
process we make sure to reduce the

1291
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,040
surface of other so if you don't use a

1292
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,760
system just shut it off if you don't use

1293
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,319
a model just remove the remove the

1294
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,880
configuration and apply photo patch

1295
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,280
management process on top of that

1296
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,720
also

1297
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,480
talking about shooting down the system

1298
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,400
very often there's a plenty of system

1299
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,839
that are

1300
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,160
running only for

1301
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,400
some reporting and for legal purposes so

1302
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,000
there are no more

1303
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,200
they are no more operational no one is

1304
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,680
conducting any transactions there

1305
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,240
so instead of keeping them up and

1306
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,520
running

1307
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,280
the strong recommendations to our

1308
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,599
characters legacy system figure out the

1309
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,599
most important reports and extract those

1310
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,520
reports to your business warehouse

1311
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,160
solutions like power bi for example all

1312
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,640
to match the same set of systems for i

1313
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,520
don't know

1314
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,119
expenses

1315
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,280
for example we need one instead of

1316
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,880
having 10 10 local systems archiving

1317
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,440
data is also very important one so

1318
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,599
make sure that you understand and secure

1319
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,720
the whole

1320
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,240
process of archive data that the data

1321
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,800
are also securely stopped

1322
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,760
again very obvious but sometimes

1323
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,520
not

1324
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,839
in line with with the requirements and

1325
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,400
best practices much technical aspects

1326
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,079
yeah when it comes to technical aspects

1327
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,920
i think what is important to mention is

1328
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,160
that application security can be on

1329
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,440
multiple layers so even if you have some

1330
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,680
vulnerabilities in inside your

1331
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,559
application you can still do a lot

1332
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,000
just to protect yourself from the

1333
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,960
attacks

1334
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,280
so if for if fixing the code is not

1335
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,200
possible for whatever reason it might be

1336
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,000
i don't know licensing reason or

1337
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,119
lack of time budget skills whatever you

1338
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,920
can still put some say security overlay

1339
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,480
on top which can be relatively easily

1340
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,839
implemented

1341
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,480
so again i've listed several examples

1342
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,520
here

1343
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,599
again with application firewall a lot of

1344
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,240
people from security world will tell us

1345
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,839
that we application firewall can be

1346
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,960
bypassed and that is tool however when

1347
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,200
we are talking about a lot of internal

1348
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,000
applications usually

1349
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,359
they are not

1350
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,440
exposed in the same way as applications

1351
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,920
which are consumer facing so what

1352
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,760
would give us reasonable level of

1353
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,200
protection

1354
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,520
uh same with other things so again for

1355
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,839
example authentication you have some

1356
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,160
solutions on the market which allows you

1357
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,520
to set

1358
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,839
another level of authentication on top

1359
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,640
of what the application offers right and

1360
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,480
usually when you can set up this kind of

1361
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,720
authentication you can also add

1362
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,880
multi-factor authentication on top

1363
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,839
okay so what i'm trying to say is that

1364
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,839
if you cannot fix codes there's a lot of

1365
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,520
things that you can do and you can

1366
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,400
relatively easily implement it globally

1367
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,880
so if you have a good network setup if

1368
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,280
you have a good talk sync mechanism in

1369
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,920
place it should be relatively easy to

1370
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,480
add the application firewall encryption

1371
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,880
security headers authentication all the

1372
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,559
other things which you can think of

1373
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,359
so that's it from us

1374
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,599
for for today uh

1375
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,640
basically

1376
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,920
right now you can probably go to your

1377
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,599
inventory application to ask some

1378
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,880
question there

1379
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,839
uh

1380
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,720
if if there are any uh you can obviously

1381
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,880
also reach us

1382
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,640
directly i don't know you can reach me

1383
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,920

1384
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,359
uh or

1385
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,960
and i will also

1386
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,920
try to do to pass the message to malik

1387
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,280
uh

1388
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,440
