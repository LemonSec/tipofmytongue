1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
um so good morning again

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,279
uh i have prepared a completely new

3
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,720
presentation

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,199
about the ip about the current state of

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,080
i.t security in slovakia the name of the

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,279
presentation or title of the

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,039
presentation is for the third time

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,558
everything's wrong

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,640
and i'm going to i'm going to tell you

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,239
about like a three big fails of national

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,920
health institute

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
uh in slovakia

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,440
how uh in our company uh we were able to

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,480
reveal trivial critical vulnerabilities

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,600
and thanks to these critical

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,039
vulnerabilities we were able to uh to

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,120
download uh

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,520
all sensitive almost all sensitive copy

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
data on all citizens

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,160
of slovakia so let's start

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,760
firstly very short background uh i'm id

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
security guy i do like security for the

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,760
last 20 years i created multiple uh

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
ethical hacking security hacking

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,200
companies uh

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,280
netanyahu also have some other companies

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,320
and in the past i participated

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
and i was looking for vulnerabilities in

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,119
many

30
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,720
many different public services uh or or

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,479
massively's products

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,159
maybe i should mention that i really

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,479
like freak out vulnerabilities in athens

34
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,799
tickets like a public sms which which

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,880
are used for public transport in most

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,360
european cities also with my colleague

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,640
uh we brought the first open source the

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
first open source cracker

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
uh thanks to this corrector we were able

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,280
to create almost one billion of mile for

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,439
classic cards and these were like really

42
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,159
huge so interviews for example isaac or

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,159
euro 26 or

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
any of these uh massively used car uh

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
you were very vulnerable and it was

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,640
possible to find like keys to crack this

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,280
car and find the keys make the clone of

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,720
these cards

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,360
also i revo another vulnerability in

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,160
parking tickets in slovakia

51
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
two years ago we also did a big hack

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,840
uh we revealed

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,319
um very very serious vulnerability in

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,640
the system which is used by all slovak

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,080
entrepreneurs i mean more 100 000 people

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
to register cash operations so for

57
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,599
example in slovakia when you want to

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,599
when you go to supermarket or you go you

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,560
go to the restaurant you buy anything

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,360
uh paid by cash or you pay by card this

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,080
information is immediately sent to uh

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
slovak tax office

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
and they use like a specific hardware

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,920
where they store the sensitive

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,400
information we found a way how to how to

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
compromise uh how to how to

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
uh

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,360
completely emulate uh systems which is

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
used for recording this sensitive

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,480
information

71
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,760
one important thing uh we always follow

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,480
responsible vulnerability disclosure so

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,519
what does mean we always notify the

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,200
vendor like the given institution

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,720
responsible for the given service or

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,959
product we wait

77
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,000
a few days a few weeks a few months

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,319
uh for fix or patch for from the from

79
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,959
the given institution and after that we

80
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,879
release the information about the given

81
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,760
vulnerability uh we did it in the past

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,560
we still are we still doing uh doing

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
that just now

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
but it's

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
but unfortunately in these days that we

86
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
are facing like a

87
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,000
uh

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
they're they're trying to sue us so so

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,239
we are facing like a legal process in

90
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,879
slovakia unfortunately

91
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,159
so now i'm going to uh tell you about uh

92
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,040
like something that is related to covet

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,519
and in slovakia we have one important

94
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,239
institution which is called nh ic which

95
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,959
means national health information center

96
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,480
what does it mean

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,200
um in slovakia

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,680
like everything related to khabib or

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,120
copy data management it's highly

100
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
centralized so for example when you make

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,320
any covet test in slovakia or you are

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,798
vaccinated in slovakia you're vaccinated

103
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,199
in slovakia this information is

104
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,120
immediately uh

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,040
sent to one place so so basically the

106
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,639
national health information center is

107
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,960
responsible for gathering

108
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,240
analyzing and storing of all cover tests

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,520
of our people who are who were tested in

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
slovakia as well

111
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,759
for our coveted vaccination of all

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,639
citizens and this is like a really big

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,720
thing because it means that national

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,639
health information center is a single

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,120
point of failure which which means when

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,360
anyone compromises your application of

117
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,639
servers

118
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,560
all kobe data

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,759
about all in all citizens will can leak

120
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,080
and can be misused for example in czech

121
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
republic uh it's decentralized so in the

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
czech republic there is no one

123
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
centralized

124
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,600
centralized

125
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
place where all these information of all

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
patients are are centralized but

127
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
unfortunately uh in slovakia we have

128
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
everything centralized so just one

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,720
vulnerability can lead to uh can lead to

130
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
a leak of all covey data sensitive

131
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,520
information and this is exactly what

132
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,960
happened and i'm going to describe how

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,840
so

134
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
first fail

135
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,400
uh

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,759
in um 30 30 of march 2020

137
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,240
the map of covet positive people leaked

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,880
from this national healthcare institute

139
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,320
and

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,280
because in that time we consider covet

141
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,000
positive people infected people twist so

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
dangerous so national healthcare uh

143
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,560
institute

144
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,440
they decide to publish the the map where

145
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,919
all these people live

146
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,560
of course there was no specific names

147
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
but there was uh some crucial

148
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,800
information for each person and this

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
information was the age of the given

150
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
person

151
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
uh gender

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
if it is male or if it is female

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,800
and the street and the city so basically

154
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,720
like a approximate

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,280
uh address of the given person

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,919
and what is the goal of this probably

157
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,639
the goal was to reveal location where

158
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,199
there are mass infection or where is the

159
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,960
highest concentration of the infected

160
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,199
people hard to say

161
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,360
of course uh national health uh

162
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,639
institute

163
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,000
uh

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
argued that this information cannot be

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
misused of course it can be

166
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,599
uh so so what what was possible to do uh

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,199
it is probably it was possible to make

168
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,160
something what is called the

169
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,759
anonymization attack because uh it's

170
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,000
quite likely there are probably not many

171
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
people with a given age and generally on

172
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,199
the one street in one city

173
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,039
yeah so when you just think about how

174
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,240
many people

175
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
who are like

176
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
males or females

177
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,120
with

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,160
with a specific age live on one street

179
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,479
probably one maybe two maybe three but

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,680
not more

181
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,319
so let's de-anonymize that

182
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,360
so uh you can find a lot of sensitive

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,599
information about property owners from

184
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,680
the public slovakster

185
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,199
that uh

186
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,680
that has all information about owners

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,160
including their name including birthday

188
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
uh including birth numbers

189
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,599
so it is possible to download all this

190
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,000
information from the public institution

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,759
which is called slovakataster about the

192
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,800
owners

193
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,520
uh so it's possible to find out exactly

194
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,639
who are all owners of the given

195
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
properties on the given street

196
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,599
so then what we can do we can just

197
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,759
filter all people from this list with a

198
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,560
given h then we can filter all people

199
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
with a given gender like males or

200
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
females

201
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,599
and voila we have the name of all covet

202
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,879
19 positive uh positive person it's

203
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,039
quite likely it will be just one person

204
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,360
or maybe two person or just very few of

205
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,479
them

206
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
uh it is necessary to say that this is

207
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
the anonymization attack uh works uh

208
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,440
just for the owner's

209
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
of property so it's not possible to

210
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,479
reveal identity of renters because uh

211
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,440
information

212
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,719
renters uh it's not in these uh

213
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,039
in this public cadastr

214
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,880
[Music]

215
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,839
display that we described that this

216
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,000
ethic is definitely possible it seemed

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,720
that

218
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,399
this attack has never been publicly

219
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,760
executed

220
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,240
uh so national health crisis um uh

221
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,720
institute central they stop propagating

222
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,440
uh these saw anonymous data about

223
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
patients that can be easily

224
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,040
de-anonymized

225
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,920
and of course everything in slovakia is

226
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
connected with the politics so slavic

227
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,680
politicians they started to spread

228
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,839
rumors that these other is definitely

229
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,959
not possible and of course it was

230
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,080
okay

231
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
uh let's

232
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,880
let's let's switch to the second fail

233
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,480
uh

234
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,040
exactly one year ago

235
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,560
in our company

236
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
we were able to enumerate and download

237
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
all copy tests almost all copy tests of

238
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,519
all people

239
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,880
now you can see like a very simple very

240
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,720
funny script

241
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,480
that we used to download 100

242
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,240
130

243
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,730
000 um

244
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,040
[Music]

245
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,120
tests

246
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,720
for about 90 1900 um 1900 100 000 people

247
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
and as you can see it is

248
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,240
very simple very stupid so so using this

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,600
uh

250
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
this script is it was possible to

251
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,880
enumerate and download all copy tests of

252
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,320
all people who were tested in slovakia

253
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,360
no kidding so very simple script so

254
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,519
basically it means that using this

255
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,000
script uh we were able to to download

256
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,600
the name and true name of each tested

257
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
person first name date of birth

258
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
gender mobile number place of residence

259
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,120
half

260
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
information like for example about

261
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
clinical symptoms

262
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
also the name of laboratory where

263
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,640
the given person was tested uh his

264
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,880
medical doctor and protocol number and

265
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
of course

266
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,560
uh the result of his covered 19 19 test

267
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
so so really a lot of sensitive

268
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
information

269
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
so if i can summarize what was the fail

270
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,800
so so just this simple vulnerability uh

271
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,880
lead to the leakage of more than a

272
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
quarter of million personal data

273
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,320
uh of

274
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,279
all coitus of all slovak citizens it is

275
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,600
possible because of the following

276
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
following issues and following problems

277
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,880
uh

278
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,760
first there uh there was like a leak of

279
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,240
apf format to the public search engine

280
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,200
so we basically find out how

281
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,519
exactly this api looks like and thanks

282
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,760
to this we were able to reconstruct it

283
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,600
and and uh may make this download link

284
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,279
then uh there was possible to to uh make

285
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,839
like a direct call with no authorization

286
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,920
to this api api code

287
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,680
any authentication

288
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
so we just run this script and it

289
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
downloaded all this sensitive

290
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
information

291
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
and we were able to do that by just

292
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
simple enumerating like this number it

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
was very very easy

294
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
and another critical thing is that there

295
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,800
were no mechanism that stopped us so so

296
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,279
we could do that for 130

297
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,920
uh 30 000 recourse for ninety thousand

298
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,440
ninety thousand people

299
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
and all downloading information uh were

300
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
unencrypted so they basically it means

301
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
they were in plain text no encryption

302
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,399
was used at all

303
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,639
so um just more information uh when we

304
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,600
when we downloaded all this information

305
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,959
um it

306
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,959
uh of course this information can be

307
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,519
massively misused for example they can

308
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,920
be they can they can be misused to carry

309
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,040
out carry out sophisticated schematics

310
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,600
for example because we know like all

311
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,839
sensitive information about these people

312
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,720
uh

313
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
there they can be misused for some kind

314
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,680
of impersonification attacks so so for

315
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
example

316
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,600
someone can call you to pretend you to

317
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
be your medical doctor or your insurance

318
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
company asking you for some money or

319
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
something like that

320
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
so so

321
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,279
we can imagine a lot of scenarios that

322
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,519
can that can be used to for the

323
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,920
potential misuse of all these

324
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
of all this information

325
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,040
to be uh it is necessary to say that we

326
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,959
have never ever published this

327
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,519
information and we deleted all the all

328
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,040
this information

329
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,279
uh after the agreement with the national

330
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,079
healthcare uh health uh

331
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,639
health institute

332
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,800
so so the question is

333
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
there are many questions we should ask

334
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,639
the first the first question is uh why

335
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,279
such sensitive information about

336
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,959
covet patients

337
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,760
uh

338
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,480
were placed on the public internet

339
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
why all this information uh

340
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,399
wasn't anonymized or encrypted in any

341
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,399
way why

342
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,320
it wasn't protected in any way by

343
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
authentication

344
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,240
why they store really a lot of

345
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,720
information several months old right

346
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
away the information about several

347
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,560
months old patient records were wasn't

348
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,760
destroyed

349
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,480
so so we should ask so many questions

350
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,440
and until now we have never received any

351
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
answer to this question

352
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,639
and

353
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,639
in slovakia

354
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,279
we have a new law a new regulation

355
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,760
according to this new law which was

356
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
approved it was it was like a pandemic

357
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,160
law which was approved last year

358
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
uh slavic camera for government can

359
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,600
receive location of all like a physical

360
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,210
location

361
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,360
[Music]

362
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,480
uh gps like coordinates location from

363
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
the mobile operator

364
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,360
for each

365
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,880
uh slovak citizen from mobile for mobile

366
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,240
operators and without court order what

367
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,680
basically means

368
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
the slovak government

369
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,800
now

370
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,440
knows exactly location of all people

371
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,519
thanks to their mobile phones

372
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,639
so the question is if the state cannot

373
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,600
protect the personal information of all

374
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,639
people tested on kavit and apparently

375
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,920
it cannot

376
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,160
the thing is why do we think it can

377
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,560
protect the sensitive location data it

378
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,639
can obtain from mobile operators about

379
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,199
the location

380
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,320
so i'm very skeptical about this

381
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,360
uh

382
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,000
because this was like a really

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,839
uh this was league of a lot of sensitive

384
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
data of for a large part of slack

385
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,040
population

386
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,600
of course we uh followed the responsible

387
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
disclosure

388
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,680
of the vulnerability and we contacted

389
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,279
tiered

390
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,680
last year 13th of september and the

391
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,760
vulnerability was fixed immediately in

392
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,800
three days

393
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,160
no it wasn't immediately but it was

394
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
fixed in three days

395
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
and after this vulnerability was fixed

396
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,839
we published this information

397
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,440
we decided we decided to publish the

398
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,480
vulnerability report

399
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
and now

400
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,480
what happened last month

401
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,639
so we were able to download the eu

402
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,199
vaccination certification certificate

403
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,320
for any citizen of slovakia

404
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,639
based on their name and date of birth

405
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,079
and this was really critical

406
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,519
so another third phase

407
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,320
in slovakia we used a special

408
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,399
application which is mandatory which is

409
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,920
called iraniza which means like

410
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,759
something like e-border

411
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
and this application is mandatory and it

412
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,720
has to be used by all people who are

413
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,639
traveling to slovakia it doesn't matter

414
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,240
these people are citizens of slovakia

415
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
are not if you're traveling to slovakia

416
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040
or you are coming back to slovakia you

417
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,079
have to

418
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,240
to to to use this application and you

419
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
have to feel

420
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,600
a lot of personal data for example you

421
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,440
have to fill us your name your birth

422
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,480
number

423
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,040
uh unit or some id number assigned by

424
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
another country your email address your

425
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,000
mobile number uh the information whether

426
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
you were vaccinated or and and therefore

427
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,560
you are not going to the current team or

428
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,600
not

429
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
so uh

430
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,240
so when you're traveling to slovakia by

431
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,839
car by plane

432
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,040
by train

433
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,360
officially you should

434
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,120
use this application and you should

435
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
provide this information to the slovak

436
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,039
government

437
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,959
and we revealed one month ago revealed

438
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,799
critical vulnerability in this

439
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,000
application

440
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
we revealed that this application

441
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,400
allows really anyone to change the

442
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,959
contact details of any registered

443
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,079
citizen

444
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,959
so so so for example uh

445
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,000
when

446
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,120
you in slovakia everybody

447
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
everybody has some kind of unique

448
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
identification which is uh

449
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,440
birth number birth number is basically

450
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,240
uh

451
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
um is basically

452
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,360
uh constructed for the birth date but

453
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,679
it's not only birthday there's just some

454
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,120
another numbers

455
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,080
so for example in slovakia uh when you

456
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,919
when you went uh

457
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,480
and you you were vaccinated

458
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,880
uh during the vaccination during your

459
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,280
vaccination you filled your you provide

460
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
you provided to the government some

461
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,960
personal information so for example your

462
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,000
email

463
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
uh your mobile mobile mobile phone

464
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,640
number and what we reveal that if later

465
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,600
you use the application iranita whether

466
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,960
you be the same birth number

467
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,919
you were able to update

468
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,960
to set up the new contact details for

469
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,320
the given birth number

470
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,480
without any other question so basically

471
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,520
it means

472
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,840
if you know the birth number of any

473
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,200
politician of any person in slovakia

474
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
you can register him or her

475
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,799
um to

476
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,280
to the system and you can easily

477
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,679
you could easily change

478
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,080
contact details of the given person and

479
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,440
this was and this was critical

480
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,799
so

481
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
i tried to

482
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,559
summarize it again just to

483
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,400
to make it more clear

484
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,280
so firstly you could fill everyone in

485
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,600
its application which is mandatory for

486
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,320
anyone whose broad number you know

487
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,640
uh so when you're when you're feeling

488
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,440
this information you just set up the new

489
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
contact details for the given person

490
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
you know the first number

491
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,160
and then

492
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,039
during this uh you could trivially gain

493
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,200
full control over all communication

494
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
channel because this information is

495
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,160
updated so these new contact details you

496
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,440
could send

497
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,520
uh for example

498
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,760
uh his or her you

499
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,520
could certificate

500
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,160
or you could do you could you could do

501
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,960
any other operation on behalf of victims

502
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,200
for example you could do register for

503
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,720
vaccination

504
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
change vaccination vaccination

505
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
registration edit any personal

506
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,400
information and so on

507
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,120
so so basically this was like a really

508
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,559
simple stupid uh vulnerability just the

509
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,559
possibility to change

510
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,280
like a contact details for any person

511
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,919
you know like a birth number

512
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
so the question is how to reveal the

513
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,120
birth number because probably we know

514
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,080
the the birthday of any person

515
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,200
you can you can find like a birth date

516
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,760
of famous people for example celebrities

517
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,640
or

518
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,520
politician and wikipedia and we can if

519
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,320
you can find like a birth date of all

520
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,240
other person at facebook so it's quite

521
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,360
easy but uh the question is how it is

522
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,320
possible to reveal to find out the birth

523
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,280
number

524
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,080
uh

525
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,320
according to the information according

526
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,400
to his birth date number

527
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
or birth date and his name

528
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,799
so

529
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,520
um so i can check both numbers can be

530
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,320
expressed in the following form as we

531
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,840
can see it's basically a 10 digit number

532
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,880
so so there is like a year month day

533
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,000
and some on four random numbers but the

534
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,159
thing is that the whole

535
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,760
10 digit number

536
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,799
has to be divisible by 11.

537
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,200
so so uh you we

538
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,679
we can we can estimate there are for for

539
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,960
the each um burst date there are like a

540
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,440
ten thousand percent number but it's not

541
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,400
true

542
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,440
because if if it if it is divisible by

543
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,360
11 for the it means that for the each

544
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,120
uh birth date

545
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,559
uh we can generate a or we can find out

546
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,200
just 900 909 birth numbers and that's

547
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,080
exactly what we did so we use like a

548
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,440
trivial script to generate all male and

549
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,440
female numbers so uh it's like 15

550
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,799
millions uh birth numbers uh

551
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,640
male 1 birth numbers and about another

552
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,039
50 million female birth numbers so

553
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,360
together 30 millions

554
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,640
but the thing is

555
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,559
these birth numbers were completely

556
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
generated so the question is

557
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,600
how

558
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,400
uh how how it is possible to find out

559
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,039
which of these birth numbers are real

560
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,400
so uh the reveal we find out another

561
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
government service like a publicly

562
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,360
available government service uh which is

563
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,919
called verification of insured person

564
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,080
insurance relationship so this is the

565
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,039
link

566
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,360
and this is like a really

567
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
really uh simple form when you just get

568
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
you can put birth

569
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
number of any person

570
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,919
with a optional information like a name

571
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,200
and sure name

572
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,480
and uh this form immediately shows you

573
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
if the given person

574
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,120
uh

575
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,360
if the given personal birth number is

576
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,640
wallet valid or not so very easy so what

577
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,760
we did

578
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,360
for for example for any celebrity

579
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,159
uh we know the first birthday to be

580
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,880
generated exactly 909 uh potential

581
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,320
possible birth

582
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,640
birth numbers and we use these following

583
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,200
quartiles just to find out which of

584
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,039
these 909

585
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,559
birth uh

586
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,440
numbers are valid or not

587
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,840
and it works in one person cases so

588
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
super reliable

589
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,120
this portal had also some security

590
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,240
issues for example the captcha

591
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
verification was totally broken so we

592
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,159
could reuse captcha multiple times

593
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,280
and also uh there was another optional

594
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
uh fields like a name and true name and

595
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,679
thanks to these optional fields we were

596
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,520
able to uh specify the name and and sure

597
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,360
name of any person we are looking for

598
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,960
the first number

599
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,720
so so um

600
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,640
after um after contacting

601
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,559
um after conducted syrt

602
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,960
uh they fixed this portal so they

603
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
basically fixed this capture

604
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,600
verification and they also removed

605
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,440
these optional fields like a name and

606
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,520
shown

607
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,320
okay

608
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,039
so

609
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,640
thanks to these

610
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,320
we were able to find out birth numbers

611
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,679
of several

612
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,679
or almost all prominent slavic

613
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,720
politician with immediate minutes

614
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,440
and also we were able to download their

615
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,400
covet certificates or if they were not

616
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,720
vaccinated they usually did like an

617
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,520
antibodies test we were able to

618
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,279
download antibodies tests

619
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,400
and

620
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
we did it for prominent slavic

621
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,120
politicians but of course

622
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,799
this is possible to

623
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,360
to do for uh to identify the birth

624
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,240
number of any citizen of slavic republic

625
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,159
and download his covet

626
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,240
certificate or

627
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,720
result of his coveted antibody stress so

628
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,600
basically we find out that this possible

629
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,840
to do for basically anyone in slovakia

630
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,400
and then we analyze like multiple

631
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,520
possible scenarios because this was

632
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,159
possible to this is possible to do just

633
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,480
for the person we know

634
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,440
we know his or her birth number or birth

635
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,240
date but what about like a massively

636
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,960
download the vaccination certificate of

637
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,559
all citizens

638
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,240
uh this is

639
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,919
likely possible

640
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,360
because uh it is possible to use a land

641
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,720
registry

642
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,760
or cadastr in slovakia callister

643
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,960
where

644
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,080
the each owner has sensitive information

645
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,000
of any property

646
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,640
has information like name sure name his

647
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,000
date of birth

648
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,120
so basically uh in the past there were

649
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,640
multiple multiple tries uh to

650
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,960
completely leak this line register or

651
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,559
the caster

652
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,320
and also there is like a private

653
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,000
database which is called state

654
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,760
population register

655
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,039
only specific institution in slovakia

656
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,880
uh has um have access to uh to these uh

657
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,559
state population which is like mobile

658
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,400
operators for example

659
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,799
and all these institutions they know

660
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,720
exactly like a birth name

661
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,880
birth name of all their customers for

662
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,000
example of all people so when they uh

663
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,320
when they use the vulnerability i

664
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,400
described before

665
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
using they were definitely able to

666
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,440
download

667
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,400
to download the eu covet vaccination

668
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
certificate for

669
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
most people maybe even the whole

670
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,159
population

671
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,400
and now uh let's describe some uh nasty

672
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,840
consequences of of this attack so the

673
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,679
first thing is uh

674
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,159
what is quite nice about this adder is

675
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,120
that

676
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,440
you can download the

677
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,320
value eu vaccination certificate of your

678
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
name namesake

679
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,000
so if there is another person with a

680
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,159
for example my my name pavel looked like

681
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,880
it's quite common in slovakia in

682
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,520
slovakia there are at least like 20

683
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,919
different people with the same name like

684
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,520
like like my name

685
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,679
so the thing is uh it's quite likely

686
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,279
from this that this maybe one third or

687
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,960
maybe half of all these people are

688
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,159
vaccinated so what i can do i can just

689
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,039
can i can i can just download uh the

690
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,799
covet certificate

691
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,080
of my namesake and i can i can use this

692
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,880
uh certificate basically everywhere as

693
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,840
an unvaccinated person so i can uh i can

694
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,080
use it to interest around all places

695
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,159
where all these vaccination certificates

696
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,520
are required

697
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,440
and what is quite interesting and funny

698
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,720
is that

699
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,480
nobody assume

700
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,039
assumes that anyone can update their

701
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,279
names namesake eu vaccination

702
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,880
certificate so it means uh when you have

703
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,520
the same name like uh

704
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
like your namesake

705
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,880
nobody nobody

706
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,520
will will check your date of birth uh

707
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
when checking the eu vaccination

708
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,480
certificate so it's very likely that

709
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
this impersonation attack

710
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
will be feasible

711
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,320
another big problem is that uh

712
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,600
thanks to these uh mandatory application

713
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,240
iraniza e-border

714
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,080
it is possible to contaminate completely

715
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,840
this national health care health

716
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,320
institute uh database

717
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,799
and basically you can you you you can

718
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,600
put to granting virtually anyone and

719
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,240
this is really dangerous so for example

720
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,840
when you know like a birth number of any

721
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,159
your favorite or non-favorite politician

722
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,159
or any person

723
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,120
uh like a birthday then you can

724
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,760
then you can like generate a birth

725
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,720
number

726
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,039
you can register this given person to

727
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,799
the iraniza

728
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,200
and it's really uh and for example if

729
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,360
this person is not vaccinated and when

730
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,399
you just

731
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,760
register him that he is or she is coming

732
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,159
back from some dangerous country some

733
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,080
africa or brazil or you know some covet

734
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,480
dangerous country

735
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,399
according to our legislation in slovakia

736
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,360
this person is automatically at risk of

737
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,120
mandatory quarantine

738
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,039
and he or she

739
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,559
needs to go to quarantine and basically

740
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,000
there is like a denial of free movement

741
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
so uh

742
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,520
we didn't demonstrate

743
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,320
the the the iranis application

744
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,520
can be

745
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,440
very in a very easy way completely

746
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,760
contaminated and makes no sense and we

747
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,080
recommend it not to use this application

748
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,559
unfortunately this application

749
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,480
is it's it's still yields in slovakia

750
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,200
uh and because this is also a big thing

751
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,080
uh

752
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,000
we did like responsible disclosure of

753
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,480
the vulnerability so we contacted uh

754
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,600
syria

755
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,880
uh 30 of july 2021

756
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,760
and

757
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,799
they confirmed it three days after and

758
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,279
basically in one week

759
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,840
like 10 days they fixed uh

760
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,520
they fixed all these vulnerabilities

761
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,640
but

762
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,000
despite responsible disclosure policy

763
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,559
nation health uh institute has failed a

764
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,720
criminal complaint against unknown

765
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,760
perpetrate perpetrator and unfortunately

766
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,039
we are the only ones uh who can be

767
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,960
prosecuted

768
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,200
so uh

769
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,679
what just happened is that instead of

770
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,640
saying thank you a lot for telling us

771
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,840
about this critical vulnerable

772
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,559
vulnerability

773
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,559
national health institute they accused

774
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,000
us

775
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,960
that we

776
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,360
that we stole the birth number of

777
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,520
citizens and this is like this like a

778
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,760
lie because we have never done it

779
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,000
because we generated them from scratch

780
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,559
and they always

781
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,450
accused us that we publicly misused

782
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,640
[Music]

783
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,960
this national health institute to change

784
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,880
the context details of citizens and

785
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,200
steal their data which also we have

786
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,799
never done it because we followed

787
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,320
the black day for its security in

788
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,760
slovakia

789
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,159
because it's very dangerous president

790
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,039
uh

791
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,559
and it means that no idea security firm

792
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,279
or

793
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,480
no id security people will have any any

794
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,120
incentive to report any vulnerabilities

795
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,640
in the state in state system of slovakia

796
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,919
because

797
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,120
they will face the risk of prosecution

798
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,279
so i consider that this is really

799
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,679
dangerous what is just happening and i

800
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,799
strongly hope it will survive this legal

801
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,240
process

802
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,640
that's all oh thank you a lot for your

803
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,640
attention

804
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,039
you
