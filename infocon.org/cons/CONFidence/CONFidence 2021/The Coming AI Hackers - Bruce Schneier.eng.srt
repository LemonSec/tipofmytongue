1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,240
all right so

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,000
hey hi welcome

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,880
uh

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
i want to talk about ai hackers

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,960
and i mean right this is something else

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
i want us to worry about

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,680
i want us to think about

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,800
ai hacking systems

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,720
hacking humanity and i think it's going

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,599
to be

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,239
unlike anything that's come before

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,760
i think ais are going to find

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
vulnerabilities in all sorts of systems

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,160
not just computer systems i'm thinking

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,000
of social economic political systems and

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,840
i think they're going to exploit them at

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
an unprecedented speed scale and scope

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
i mean this isn't just a difference in

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,680
degree i think it's a difference in kind

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,840
and i think it culminates in ai systems

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
hacking other ai systems and with we

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,480
humans being

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,600
i don't know a little more than

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,199
collateral damage

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,640
all right so

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,040
maybe this is a bit of hyperbole

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,119
but nothing i'm going to talk about

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,840
requires far future science fiction

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,520
technology

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,240
i'm not postulating any singularity

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,159
i'm not assuming intelligent intelligent

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,439
androids

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,600
i'm not even assuming evil intent on the

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
part of anyone

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,799
most of the hacks i'm going to talk

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,759
about don't even require major research

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,600
breakthroughs in ai

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
and they'll improve as ai gets more

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,840
sophisticated but we can see hints of

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,079
them in operation today

41
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,880
and this hacking will come naturally as

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,040
ai's become more advanced at learning

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,920
understanding and problem solving

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,439
all right so the first thing i want to

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,320
do is generalize the term hacking this

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,439
is something i've been thinking about

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,200
for a couple of years now it's actually

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,320
a book i'm

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,880
trying to write i talked about the rsa

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,159
conference

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,799
i guess last year before the pandemic

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,600
so

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
let's think about for example the tax

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,960
code

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
right it's not computer code but it is

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,199
code

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,760
it's a series of algorithms with inputs

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,120
and outputs it's deterministic

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,120
supposedly right those are the tax rules

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,319
the tax codes has vulnerabilities

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,920
in the u.s we call them tax loopholes

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,959
the tax code has exploits

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,280
in the u.s we call them tax avoidance

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,720
strategies

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,080
and there are an entire industry

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
of black hat hackers whose job it is to

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
find and exploit

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,879
tax code vulnerabilities

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,040
those are tax accountants those are tax

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,800
attorneys

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
that's the kind of generalization i want

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
to think about

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
and so a hack what is a hack

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
a hack is something that a system

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
permits

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,120
but is unintended and unwanted and

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,760
unanticipated by the designers

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,000
it's a decent definition

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
here's another

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,480
a clever

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,599
unintended exploitation of a system

82
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,879
which one subverts the rules of a system

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,599
to at the expense of some other part of

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,280
that system

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,599
and so we know hacks when we see them

86
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,680
it's a subjective term

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
it encompasses a notion of novelty and

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,879
cleverness

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,319
it's a subversion it's an exploitation

90
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,519
it's unintended unanticipated

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,799
the hacks follow the rules of a system

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,760
but subvert its goals or intent

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,959
it takes advantage of sloppily written

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
rules

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,440
and any system of rules can be hacked

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
thinking about it broadly you can find

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,720
hacks in professional sports

98
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
in consumer reward programs like

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,879
frequent flyer plans in financial

100
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,280
systems in politics

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,920
in lots of economic political and social

102
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,840
systems against our cognitive functions

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,920
but a curved hockey stick in

104
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
professional hockey is a hack

105
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,720
and we know the name of the hacker the

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,519
player who invented it

107
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,320
mileage runs are a hack

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,720
in politics especially american politics

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
the filibuster

110
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
that was originally a hack back in roman

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
times

112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
hedge funds are full of hacks

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,360
a system is just a set of rules

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,120
or it could be norms right the rules

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
might not be always formal

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
and even the best thought out sets of

117
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
rules will be incomplete or inconsistent

118
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,440
it'll have ambiguities

119
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
there'll be things the designers haven't

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
thought of

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,639
and as long as there are people who want

122
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,120
to subvert the goals of a system there

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
will be hacks

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,600
and ais are becoming hackers

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
but in 2016 darpa held an ai capture the

126
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
flag event

127
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,039
right you all know the game

128
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,639
it's a staple at hacker conferences

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,000
around the world

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
at confidence back when it was in person

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
so this event was in 2016.

132
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
there were over a hundred teams that

133
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,240
competed

134
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
seven finalists faced off at defcon 2016

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,880
and for 10 hours the ais hacked the

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,639
other team's computers and defended

137
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,160
their own

138
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,479
and an ai called mayhem out of carnegie

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,120
mellon won

140
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,000
and ais are now doing vulnerability

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,199
finding

142
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,560
right they're not very good at it yet

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,320
there's ongoing research but really the

144
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
results are promising

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,320
and you know how this is this goes right

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,720
the ai's will get better every year and

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,560
sooner or later they'll get better at

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,639
people at finding vulnerabilities in

149
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,039
code

150
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,199
and i think the implications of this go

151
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,240
far beyond computer networks

152
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,560
vulnerabilities in the tax code

153
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
vulnerabilities and financial

154
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,560
regulations vulnerabilities in all sorts

155
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
of social economic and political systems

156
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
and there are really two different

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,160
issues here

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,240
the first is that an ai might be

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,880
instructed to hack one of these systems

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,600
you can imagine someone feeding an ai

161
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,319
the world's tax codes or the world's

162
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,720
financial regulations with the intent of

163
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
having to create a slew of profitable

164
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,639
hacks

165
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,319
and the other is that an ai might

166
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,680
naturally albeit inadvertently hack a

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,600
system

168
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,840
both are dangerous but i think the

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
second is more dangerous because we

170
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
might not ever know what happened

171
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,280
and this is because of the

172
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,080
explainability problem

173
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,520
so in the hitchhiker's guide to the

174
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,639
galaxy

175
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,479
there's a race of hyper-intelligent

176
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,800
pan-dimensional beings and they build

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,039
the universe's most powerful computer

178
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,319
deep thought

179
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,560
to answer the ultimate question to life

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
the universe and everything

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,919
and we all know the answer it was 42

182
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,400
and deep thought was unable to explain

183
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,560
its answer or even what the question was

184
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,919
so this is the explainability problem

185
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
modern ai systems are essentially black

186
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
boxes

187
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840
data goes in one end and an answer comes

188
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
out the other

189
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,440
and it can be impossible to understand

190
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,400
how the system reached its conclusion

191
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,479
even if you are a programmer even if you

192
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,360
have access to the code

193
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,880
ai's don't solve problems like humans do

194
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,639
their limitations are different than

195
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,759
ours

196
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,120
they'll consider

197
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,080
more

198
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,880
possible solutions than we might

199
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,960
more importantly they'll look at more

200
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
types of solutions

201
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
they'll go down paths that we simply

202
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,599
have not considered

203
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,599
paths more complex than the sorts of

204
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,599
things that humans generally keep in

205
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,360
mind

206
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
so also 2016

207
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,319
the ai program alphago

208
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,199
won a five game match against one of the

209
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,400
world's uh champion go players

210
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,479
now this is something that shocked both

211
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,720
the ai and the go playing worlds

212
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,360
and alphago's most famous move you can

213
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
look it up it's move 37 game two

214
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,080
and it's

215
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,919
really hard to explain without delving

216
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,800
deep into go strategy but it was a move

217
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
that no human would have ever chosen to

218
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
make

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,279
2015 a research group fed an ai system

220
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,640
medical data from about 700 000 people

221
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,880
and tested whether the system

222
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,240
was able to uh to predict diseases

223
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
the result was a success

224
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
but the program deep patient

225
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
provides no explanation for the basis of

226
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,800
its diagnostics

227
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
right the researchers have no idea how

228
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
it comes with its conclusions

229
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,519
and a doctor can either trust or ignore

230
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,080
the computer it can't query it for more

231
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,320
info

232
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,080
now researchers are working on

233
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
explainable ai and while there will be

234
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
advances in this field

235
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
there seems to be a fundamental

236
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,959
trade-off between capability and

237
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,800
explainability

238
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
explanations are a cognitive shorthand

239
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,959
used by humans

240
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
suited for the way humans make decisions

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
forcing an ai to produce explanations

242
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
might be an additional constraint that

243
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,399
can affect the quality of its decisions

244
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,959
and certainly in the near term ai is

245
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,399
becoming more opaque and less

246
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
explainable

247
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
all right now let's talk about reward

248
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
hacking

249
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,600
so ai's don't solve problems in the same

250
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,680
way that people do

251
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
they will invariably stumble on

252
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,920
solutions

253
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
that we humans might have never

254
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,680
anticipated

255
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,480
and some of those will subvert the

256
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
intent of the system

257
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,480
that's because ai's don't think of it

258
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
in terms of

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,959
implications context norms and values

260
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,360
that we humans take for granted

261
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
so this is reward hacking

262
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,920
it involves achieving a goal

263
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,399
but in a way the ai's designers neither

264
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,240
wanted nor intended

265
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
and the examples are all pretty great uh

266
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
there's a soccer simulation where an ai

267
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,480
figured out that if he kicked the ball

268
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,640
out of bounds the goalie would have to

269
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,079
throw the ball in and leave the goal

270
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,519
undefended

271
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
there's a stacking simulation where an

272
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,680
ai learned to flip a block upside down

273
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
rather than stack it

274
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
uh in an evolution simulation an ai

275
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
figured out that instead of running it

276
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,959
can make itself tall enough to cross a

277
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,240
distant finish line by falling over it

278
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
so these are all hacks

279
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
you can blame them on poorly specified

280
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,959
goals or rewards and you'd be correct

281
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,720
you can point out that they all occurred

282
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,800
in simulated environments and you would

283
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,480
also be correct

284
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
but the problem is more general ai's

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,160
will inadvertently hack systems in ways

286
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
we won't expect

287
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,519
there's a great story of a researcher

288
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,279
trying to teach a robot vacuum cleaner

289
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,279
not to bump into things

290
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,279
and instead of learning not to bump into

291
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,600
things it learned to drive backwards

292
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,480
because there were no sensors back there

293
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,040
any good ai system will naturally find

294
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,079
hacks

295
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,560
if there are problems inconsistencies or

296
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,880
loopholes in the rules and those

297
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,640
properties lead to an acceptable

298
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,959
solution as defined by the rules then

299
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,120
ai's will find them

300
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
we might look at what the ai did and say

301
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,079
well technically it followed the rules

302
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,560
and yet we humans would sense a

303
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,600
deviation a cheat a hack because we

304
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
understand the context and have

305
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,120
different explicit expectations

306
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
so many of us have learned about this

307
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,040
problem as children with the king midas

308
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,720
story

309
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,920
so this is a uh an old story

310
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,440
and the god after the god dionysus

311
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,680
grants his king midas a wish

312
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
midas asks that everything he touches

313
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
turns to turns to gold

314
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,240
and midas ends up starving and miserable

315
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,399
when his food drink and daughter all

316
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,760
turn to gold

317
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
right it's a specification problem might

318
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,639
as program the wrong goal into the

319
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,560
system

320
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
we also know that genies are very

321
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,959
precise about the wording of wishes and

322
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,639
can be maliciously pedantic when

323
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,079
granting them

324
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,720
but here's the thing there is no way to

325
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,399
outsmart the genie

326
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,880
whatever you wish for he will always be

327
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
able to grant it in a way that you wish

328
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,519
he hadn't the genie will always be able

329
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
to hack your wish

330
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,760
the problem is that in human language

331
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,240
and thought goals and desires are always

332
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,959
underspecified we never describe all the

333
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,200
options we never include all the caveats

334
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
and explanations and provisos we never

335
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
close off all the avenues we're hacking

336
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,959
we can't

337
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,920
any goal we specify will necessarily be

338
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,519
incomplete

339
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,360
now this is largely okay in human

340
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,600
interactions because people understand

341
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,120
context and act and act in good faith

342
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,760
right we are all socialized and in the

343
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,720
process of becoming so we acquire common

344
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
sense about how people in the world

345
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,519
works

346
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,360
and we fill any gaps in our

347
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,560
understanding with that context

348
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
so if i asked you to get me some coffee

349
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,399
you would probably go to the nearest

350
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,639
coffee pot and pour me a cup or maybe

351
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,560
walk to the corner coffee shop and buy

352
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,360
one

353
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,279
you would not bring me a pound of raw

354
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,600
beans you would not buy a coffee

355
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,880
plantation

356
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,800
you would also not look for the closest

357
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,880
person holding a cup of coffee and rip

358
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
it out of their hands

359
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,880
i wouldn't have to specify any of that

360
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,360
you would just know

361
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,440
similarly if i asked you to develop a

362
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,519
technology that would turn things to

363
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,000
gold untouched you wouldn't build it so

364
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,720
it starved the person using it

365
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,880
i wouldn't have to specify that you

366
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
would just know

367
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,920
we can't completely specify goals to an

368
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,040
ai

369
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,680
and an ai won't completely be able to

370
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,399
understand context

371
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,839
so in 2015 volkswagen volkswagen was

372
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,360
caught cheating on a missions control

373
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,000
test this story doesn't involve the ai

374
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
it's human programs programming a

375
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
regular computer to cheat but it

376
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,079
illustrates the problem well

377
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,800
so the engineers program the engine to

378
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,199
detect emission control testing and to

379
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,199
behave differently when being

380
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,480
tested

381
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
their cheat remained undetected for

382
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,399
years because it's hard to figure out

383
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,720
what software is doing

384
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,519
so if i asked you to design a car's

385
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,920
engine control software to maximize

386
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,399
performance while still passing control

387
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,360
tests

388
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
you wouldn't design the software to

389
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
cheat without understanding that you

390
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,639
were cheating

391
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,760
this simply isn't true for an ai

392
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,160
it will think out of the box could

393
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,000
because it won't have a conception of

394
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,199
the box

395
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,120
it won't understand

396
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,199
that the volkswagen solution harms

397
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,519
others or that it undermines the intent

398
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,360
of a mission control test or that it's

399
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,199
breaking the law

400
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,399
unless the programmers specify the goal

401
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,399
of not behaving differently when being

402
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,880
tested and ai might come up with the

403
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
same hack

404
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,480
the programmers will be satisfied the

405
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,880
accountants will be thrilled and because

406
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,120
of the explainability problem no one

407
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,759
will realize what the ai did

408
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,639
and yes now that we know the volkswagen

409
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,440
story we can explicitly set the goal to

410
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,680
avoid that particular hack

411
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,120
but there are other hacks the

412
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,680
programmers will not anticipate

413
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,279
the lesson of the genie is that there

414
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,199
will always be hacks the programs will

415
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,880
not anticipate

416
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,560
and the worry isn't limited to the

417
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,000
obvious hacks

418
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,920
the greatest worry are the hacks that

419
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,519
aren't so obvious

420
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,680
the ones whose effects are subtle like

421
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,399
the volkswagen hack

422
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,160
now we've already seen the first

423
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,079
generation of this

424
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,040
a lot has been written about

425
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,639
recommendation engines and how they push

426
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
people towards extreme content

427
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,160
they weren't programmed to do this it's

428
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,480
a property that naturally emerged

429
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
the algorithms learned to push extreme

430
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
content because that's what people

431
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,000
respond to

432
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,839
and this is important it didn't take a

433
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,560
bad actor to create this hack a pretty

434
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,720
basic automated system found it's on its

435
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,399
own

436
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,160
now nothing i'm saying here will be news

437
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,839
to ai researchers

438
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,880
and many of you are currently

439
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,959
considering ways to defend against gold

440
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,639
and reward hacking

441
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,360
one solution is to teach ai's context

442
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,800
the general term for this sort of

443
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,160
research is value alignment

444
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,959
and

445
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,959
right how to create ai that mirrors our

446
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,160
values

447
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,079
and solutions kind of have two different

448
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,199
extremes

449
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,199
versus to explicitly specify those

450
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
values the other is to create ais that

451
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,160
learn our values possibly by observing

452
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,279
humans in that in action

453
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,199
so how realistic is anything i've said

454
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,319
so far the answer is it depends

455
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,039
the feasibility of any ai hacking

456
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,039
depends on the specific system being

457
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,240
modeled

458
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,799
for an ai to even start on optimizing a

459
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,199
problem let alone hacking a completely

460
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,640
novel solution

461
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,799
all the rules of the environment must be

462
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,880
formalized in a way that a computer can

463
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,079
understand

464
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,559
goals known in ai's objective functions

465
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,039
need to be established and the a need

466
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,799
some sort of feedback on how well it's

467
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,840
doing so it can improve

468
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,520
performance sometimes this is a trivial

469
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,320
matter

470
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,960
for a game like go it's easy right the

471
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
rules objective feedback did you win or

472
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,000
lose are all precisely specified and

473
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,240
there's nothing outside of these things

474
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
to complicate the waters

475
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,320
and this is why most of the current

476
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,720
examples of goal and reward hacking come

477
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
from simulated environments

478
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,360
they're artificial and constrained with

479
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,880
all the rules specified to the ai

480
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,640
what really matters here is the

481
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
ambiguity in a system

482
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,120
we can imagine feeding the world's tax

483
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,960
laws into an ai

484
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
because the tax code consists of

485
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,000
formulas

486
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,919
but there is still some ambiguity in

487
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,200
those laws

488
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,960
and that ambiguity is difficult to

489
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,280
translate into code which means an ai

490
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,760
will have trouble dealing with it

491
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,200
most human systems are even more

492
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
ambiguous

493
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
it's hard to imagine ai coming up with a

494
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,200
real world sports hack like curving a

495
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,559
hockey stick

496
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,799
and they ai would have to understand not

497
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,799
just the rules of the game but the

498
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,640
physiology of the players the

499
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,480
aerodynamics of the stick and the puck

500
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,840
and so on

501
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,640
and this ambiguity tends to be

502
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,200
a near-term security defense against ai

503
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,880
hacking

504
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,200
it'll be a long time before ai's really

505
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,360
capable of modeling and stimulating the

506
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,440
ways that people work and before they're

507
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,600
capable of coming up with novel ways to

508
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,280
hack the legislative process

509
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,120
probably the first place to look for ai

510
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,600
hacking is in financial systems since a

511
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,280
lot of those rules are designed to be

512
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,760
algorithmically tractable

513
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,679
right we can imagine equipping an ai

514
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,080
with all the world's financial laws plus

515
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,760
all the world's news and financial

516
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,679
information and giving it the goal of

517
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,160
maximize profit

518
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
my guess isn't very far off and that the

519
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,720
result will be all sorts of novel hacks

520
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,280
but here's the thing about ai

521
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,960
advances are discontinuous and

522
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,720
counter-intuitive

523
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,799
things that seem to be easy turn out to

524
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,960
be hard and things that hard to not to

525
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,200
be easy and we don't know until the

526
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
breakthrough occurs when i was in

527
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,600
college in the early 80s we learned that

528
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,679
the game of go would never be mastered

529
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,600
by a computer because of its enormous

530
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,320
complexity not the rules but the number

531
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
of possible moves

532
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,840
and now a computer has beaten a human

533
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,679
world champion

534
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,360
some of it was advances due to this in

535
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
the science of ai but most of the

536
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,799
improvement was just by throwing more

537
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,280
computing power at the problem

538
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
so while a world filled with ai hackers

539
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,000
is still science fiction it's not stupid

540
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,760
science fiction

541
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,600
and i think we had better start thinking

542
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,520
about its implications now

543
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
so hacking is as old as humanity

544
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,799
we are creative problem solvers we are

545
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
loophole exploiters

546
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,480
we manipulate systems to serve our

547
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,520
interests

548
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,159
we strive for more influence more power

549
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,720
more wealth and hacking has forever been

550
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
a part of that

551
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,840
and still

552
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
no humans maximize their own interests

553
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,000
without constraint

554
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
even sociopaths are constrained by the

555
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,840
complexity of society

556
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,159
and their own contradictory impulses

557
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,240
they're concerned about reputation and

558
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,039
punishment they have limited time these

559
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,400
very human qualities limit hacking

560
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,480
hacking changed as everything became

561
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,919
computerized

562
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,440
because of their formalism and

563
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,919
complexity computers are uniquely

564
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,120
hackable

565
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
and today everything is a computer

566
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,799
cars appliances phones they're all

567
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,400
computers

568
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,640
all of our social systems

569
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,280
are complex socio-technical systems

570
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,320
involving computers

571
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,799
now to date hacking has exclusively been

572
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,640
a human activity

573
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
searching for new hacks requires

574
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,960
expertise creativity time and luck

575
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,679
when ai start hacking everything will

576
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,200
change again

577
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,960
they won't be constrained in the same

578
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,480
ways or have the same limits as people

579
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,120
they will think like aliens

580
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,400
they will change hacking speed scale and

581
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,159
scope

582
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,559
speed is easy computers are much faster

583
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,080
than people

584
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
a human creative process that might take

585
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,159
months or years could get compressed to

586
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,039
days hours or seconds

587
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,280
what might happen when you feed an ai

588
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,640
the entire an entire country's tax code

589
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,000
or in the case of a multinational

590
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,799
corporation the entire world's tax codes

591
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,880
will it figure out without being told

592
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,720
that it's smart to incorporate a us

593
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,039
corporation delaware or register an

594
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,360
international ship in panama

595
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,039
how many loopholes will it find that we

596
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,679
don't already know about dozens hundreds

597
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,280
thousands we actually have no idea

598
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
and it's not just speed it's scale as

599
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,720
well

600
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,280
once ai systems start discovering hacks

601
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,440
they're laid to able to exploit them at

602
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,480
a scale we're not ready for

603
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
we're already seeing shadows of this

604
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,640
with a i generated text

605
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
right a i generate an iai text

606
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,120
generation bots like gpt 3

607
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,280
they'll be replicated in the millions

608
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,880
across social media

609
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,799
they'll be engaged able to engage in the

610
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,720
issues around the clock posting billions

611
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,080
of messages

612
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,400
they will overwhelm any actual online

613
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,039
debate right what we see as boisterous

614
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,200
political debates will be bots arguing

615
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,640
with other bots

616
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,159
they will artificially influence what we

617
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,159
think is normal and what we think others

618
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,400
think

619
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,880
and the increasing scope of ai systems

620
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,120
also makes hacks more dangerous

621
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
and ais are already making important

622
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,640
decisions that affect our lives

623
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,880
decisions we used to believe were the

624
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,280
exclusive purview of human humans

625
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,000
ais make bail and parole decisions they

626
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,320
help decide who receives bank loans

627
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,960
they screen job applicants applicants

628
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,280
for college people apply for government

629
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,360
services

630
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,240
as ai systems get more capable society

631
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,799
will cede more and more important

632
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,559
decisions to them

633
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
this means that hacking of these systems

634
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,080
will become more damaging

635
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
and these hacks will be perpetrated by

636
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,200
the powerful against us

637
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,120
and while we have societal systems that

638
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
deal with hacks those systems were

639
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,240
developed

640
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,720
when hackers were human and reflect the

641
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,360
pace of human hackers

642
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
we don't have any system of governance

643
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,720
that can deal with hundreds let alone

644
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,440
thousands of newly discovered tax culls

645
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,520
we won't be able to recover from an ai

646
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,760
figuring out unanticipated but legal

647
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,640
hacks of financial systems at computer

648
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,960
speed scale and scope hacking becomes a

649
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
problem that we as society can no longer

650
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
manage

651
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,240
all right finally let's talk a bit about

652
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
defense

653
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,000
right when ai's are able to discover new

654
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,760
software vulnerabilities

655
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,840
it will be an incredible boon to hackers

656
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,880
everywhere

657
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,159
right they'll be able to use those

658
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,919
vulnerabilities to hack

659
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,360
networks around the world around the

660
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,320
clock

661
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,480
but the same technology will be useful

662
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,760
for defense

663
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,320
and imagine how a software company might

664
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,720
employ a vulnerability finding ai on its

665
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,440
own code it can identify and then patch

666
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
all or at least all the mapping

667
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
discoverable vulnerabilities into

668
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
products before releasing them

669
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
now you can even imagine this tool built

670
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
into software development tools and

671
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,520
happen automatically

672
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,000
so we can imagine a future where

673
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,760
software vulnerabilities are a thing of

674
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,279
the past

675
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
and of course the transition is period

676
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,679
is dangerous new code is secure but

677
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,840
legacy code is still vulnerable but in

678
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,279
the long run

679
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,279
ai technology defines software

680
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,720
vulnerabilities favors the defense

681
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
it's the same when we turn to hacking of

682
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,679
broader social systems sure ais might

683
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,120
find hundreds of vulnerabilities in the

684
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,159
tax code but that same technology can be

685
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,520
used to evaluate potential

686
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,000
vulnerabilities in any proposed tax law

687
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,840
or tax ruling

688
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,320
and we can imagine new tax laws being

689
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,640
tested this way

690
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,240
doesn't mean that the loopholes will get

691
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,919
fixed but it means they'll become part

692
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,279
of the public

693
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,600
and policy debate

694
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
and they can in theory be patched before

695
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
the rich and powerful exploit them

696
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,679
again the transition period is dangerous

697
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,480
but in the end this technology favors

698
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,880
the defense

699
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,960
ensuring the defense prevails also

700
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,559
requires building resilient governing

701
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,159
structures that can quickly and

702
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,880
effectively respond to hacks

703
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,480
we know how quickly companies like

704
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,440
microsoft respond to computer

705
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,200
hacks and vulnerabilities it won't do

706
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
any good if it takes years to update the

707
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,880
tax code right over legislative hack

708
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,240
becomes so entrenched that it can't

709
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,120
politically be patched modern software

710
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,919
is continually patched we need society's

711
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,960
rules to be similarly patchable

712
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,559
and this is a hard problem of modern

713
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,400
governance like well beyond the scope of

714
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,240
this talk

715
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,320
and it's really the same problem as

716
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
building governing structures that can

717
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,559
operate in the speed and complexity of

718
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,720
the information age

719
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,640
the overarching solution here is people

720
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
right what i'm describing is interlay

721
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,559
between humans and computer systems and

722
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,640
the risks inherent when computers start

723
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
doing the parts of humans

724
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,240
this too is a more general problem than

725
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,640
ai hackers and one that technologists

726
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,039
and futures futurists are writing about

727
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
and while it's easy to let technology

728
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,720
lead us into the future

729
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,360
we're a lot better off as society if we

730
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
decide what technology's role in our

731
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
future should be

732
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,080
and this is something we all need to

733
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,520
figure out now

734
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,760
before these ais come online and start

735
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,919
hacking our world

736
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,000
so that's my talk i'm happy to take

737
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,840
questions and i think there's a question

738
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
asking tool that you're supposed to use

739
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,679
then questions will be fed to me somehow

740
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,840
you
