1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,199
thank you so much for

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,960
hi everyone um thank you so much for

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,400
being here today thank you so much for

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,519
having me again at confidence i'm so

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,800
grateful to be

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
counted among such legends um at this

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,520
edition of confidence my name is

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
i am a senior threat intelligence

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,800
analyst at pwc and in my day-to-day my

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,039
main focus is on tracking advanced

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,880
persistent threats based in the

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
asia-pacific region including

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
china-based and north korea-based threat

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,719
actors

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,160
um we have quite a fact agenda today in

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,079
fact so let me just walk you through it

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,680
real quick

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,160
so we're going to have a bird's-eye view

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,039
at the start of um north korea-based

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
retractors particularly lazarus group

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,840
which pwc tracks internally as black

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,760
artemis and their pursuit of

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,399
cryptocurrency companies for the past

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
around four years

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,280
we're gonna look specifically at true

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,080
intrusion sets that we also assess

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
to be likely based in north korea that

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,960
target cryptocurrency and we call these

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,320
black alicanto and black death 2. so in

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
the talk what i'm going to do is i'm

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,640
going to give you an overview of their

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,200
intrusion chains and what you can expect

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,600
in the initial access and initial phases

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,159
of compromise by these threat actors so

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,840
you can recognize their campaigns you

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
can hunt for them and defend from them

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
should you ever encounter them and then

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
we're gonna look at how and whether at

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,759
all black alicanto and black death 2

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
have any links to black artemis that is

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
lazarus group

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,439
so without further ado since we have a

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,000
lot to be covering let's get started

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
let's get started with the timeline of

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,799
you know threat actors targeting

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
cryptocurrency

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,960
we all know that lazarus is famous for

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
uh cyber heists against financial

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
institutions whether that be bank of

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,520
bangladesh or red bank but then since

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,440
about 2017 north korea-based apts start

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,000
targeting cryptocurrency companies

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
now lazarus group for example starts by

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,000
making off with five million dollars

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
from a yapizon a south korean

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,840
cryptocurrency exchange

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
and not happy with that after yapison

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,599
rebrands to ubit

59
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,000
well in late 2017 lazarus compromises

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
ubit again and makes off with 17 of the

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,879
company's total funds which means that

62
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
actually uh ubit has to file for

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,560
bankruptcy

64
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
in the meantime lazarus has also

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,519
compromised other cryptocurrency

66
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,000
exchanges such as coinies as slovenian

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
cryptocurrency company and then this

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,160
fund spills over in 2018 when the threat

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,159
actually compromises cryptocurrency

70
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,080
exchanges across uh south korea japan

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,239
um indonesia

72
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,560
at the same time the three doctor starts

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,920
developing trojanized cryptocurrency

74
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
trading applications that you know get

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,640
installed by unknowing victims and then

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,879
they get their crypto stolen

77
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,519
but then in 2018 also there starts being

78
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
reports of an unknown intrusion set

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,159
that fishes cryptocurrency companies

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,640
with you know your documents

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,680
um and link files and specifically a

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,159
link file called

83
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,040
password.txt link

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,799
so much so that the chemistry

85
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
intelligence company that reported first

86
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,040
on this called this intrusion set

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,720
dangerous password

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,239
in 2019 f-secure releases a report about

89
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,760
lazarus group

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,440
and about a campaign targeting the

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
cryptocurrency vertical and in this

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
report there is an explicit connection

93
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,239
that is drawn between the two techniques

94
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,560
and procedures being used by lazarus and

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,280
the dangerous password intrusion set

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,879
if we skip ahead in 2020 um you know

97
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,040
lazarus continues compromising uh

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
financial entities and cryptocurrency

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,080
entities including one in new york and

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,200
then a report comes out about

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
another little known intrusion set

102
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,079
operation gold hunting

103
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,880
which also targets cryptocurrency

104
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,120
companies and investment and venture

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,880
capital firms

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
so i want you to remember these two

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,440
names dangerous password which we

108
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
internally call black alicante and

109
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
operation gold hunting which we

110
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,560
internally call a pwc black dev2 as you

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,479
can see the trend of stealing

112
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,400
cryptocurrency is significant for north

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,080
korea based reductors and later we're

114
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,280
going to touch um on why but let's with

115
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,440
further without further ado jump into

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
the you know the thick of it and let's

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
start with black alicante

118
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,400
so this right actor has actually

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
been known for quite a while

120
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
it's it's active since at least april

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,720
2018 and it is only open sourced by a

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
lot of different names and i'm gonna be

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,080
really sorry this presentation is going

124
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,520
to be full of names

125
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,080
so the aliases that black alicante goes

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,440
by are dangerous password library turtle

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,840
crypto mimic crypto core

128
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
and operations not scripted

129
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,880
there are several reports in open source

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,120
detailing this protector and you will be

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,039
able to find all of the ones that they

132
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,440
gathered in the references that are at

133
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,039
the bottom of the slide deck just in

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,639
case you want to consult them in your

135
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,639
own time later black alicante is

136
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,199
financially motivated and it's targeting

137
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,199
despite being focused on cryptocurrency

138
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,120
actually is very international it

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
doesn't necessarily matter what a

140
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,360
company space more so what it does

141
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,039
in terms of the intrusion chain that you

142
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,440
can expect to encounter when you are

143
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,039
targeted by black alicante or when

144
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,280
you're tracking this reductor well the

145
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,759
victim would receive a phishing email

146
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,919
with a compressed archive and this

147
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,160
compressed archive would contain two

148
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,199
files

149
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,880
one lear document that is password

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,160
protected

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
and one file called passwordlettext.link

152
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
so the victim would reasonably think oh

153
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
well you know i need a password to open

154
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
this file there's a file called password

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,840
here i should reasonably open it right

156
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,000
wrong because the double extension means

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,840
that this is a link file and what this

158
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
link file will do is connect through a

159
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
bitly shortened url to a first stage

160
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,479
command and control server and from

161
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,000
there will come the password used to

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
unlock the document that will be

163
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,120
displayed to the user and also cabadrat

164
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,400
kabadrat is a first stage vbscript kind

165
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
of backdoor that is dropped by a

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,120
javascript file what cabadra does is it

167
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,280
connects back to the first stage quantum

168
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,160
control server it places a link file in

169
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,720
startup to ensure that the backdoor is

170
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
persistent across system reboots

171
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,800
and will in some cases download a

172
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
further bb script backdoor known as

173
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,520
cabbage rack b which acts very much as a

174
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
profiler you know giving a more in-depth

175
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,000
view to the threat actor of who the

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,639
victim is that it compromised

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,960
and now the threat actor can choose

178
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,479
whether the victim that has been

179
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,120
infected is of interest or not

180
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,479
if it is not

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,080
well then the intrusion chain roughly

182
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,319
stops here but if the victim is of

183
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,160
interest then the threat actor will

184
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,840
start you know the kind of hands-on

185
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,479
keyboard manual exploitation and

186
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,800
manually deploy a further payload

187
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,440
another vbscript backdoor but much fully

188
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,680
featured than the other one before it

189
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
called cabadra c which even has a

190
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,240
different command and control server

191
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,360
kabaddra c then might execute commands

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,759
might you know fingerprint the system

193
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,400
and might also be used again to manually

194
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,800
deploy an even more sophisticated

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
payload that is known as mso rat please

196
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
remember that name because it's going to

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,039
come up again and again in this

198
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,639
presentation

199
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,479
so you're looking at the initial access

200
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,400
phase of baccalicante we've already

201
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,520
mentioned the use of compressed archives

202
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,319
and the combo of the password protected

203
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,160
your document and the password exceed

204
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
the link file

205
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,080
alternative types of initial infection

206
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
come when the throat actor might send a

207
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
malicious document with macros to a

208
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,039
target and ask them to enable the macros

209
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
and then the macros would reach out to

210
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,360
the bitly url shorten link and connect

211
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,639
to the first stage command control

212
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,520
server

213
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
or this protector might use double

214
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,840
extension files for example you know the

215
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,479
dot dot x dot link or dot pdf.link file

216
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,640
in terms of the themes that the viewer

217
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,880
documents have there's of course an

218
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,958
amphibian cryptocurrency the third

219
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,040
doctor might also use job descriptions

220
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
uh for specific you know roles like

221
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
cryptocurrency companies and the three

222
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,720
doctor might even use more business

223
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,399
themes such as you know here's your

224
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
salary plan for the year or you know

225
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
this is your personal development plan

226
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,040
and an employee at a company

227
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,200
might reasonably expect to receive

228
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,519
emails like that so it might be more

229
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,519
prone to opening the malicious

230
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,959
attachment

231
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,959
on the topic of job descriptions while i

232
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,360
was preparing for this presentation last

233
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,160
week my colleagues and i stumbled across

234
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
some very interesting black alicando

235
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
files you know made in september 2021

236
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,560
and

237
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
these

238
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,800
files use the job description theme and

239
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,040
double extension combo it is a technique

240
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,760
that the productor was using in 2018

241
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,279
so you can see them here on screen and

242
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,440
they reference blockchain intelligence

243
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,080
group which is an on-chain analysis

244
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,120
platform you can see salt landing which

245
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,120
is a provider of crypto backed

246
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,279
loans and then you can see jpmorgan

247
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,800
chase which is a prominent financial

248
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
institution that also

249
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
has some initiatives around

250
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,200
cryptocurrency um a few nuggets that i

251
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
wanted to point out here are that

252
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,959
first of all all three documents have

253
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,760
the same picture which says if you check

254
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,720
you know

255
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
the image it says chase like jpmorgan

256
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,440
chase but you know that doesn't really

257
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
fit in well with the fact that there are

258
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
several companies being impersonated

259
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
then you will notice that uh the

260
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
blockchain intelligence group document

261
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
actually referenced in the description

262
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
and comments real ag which is um an

263
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,279
investment and real estate uh kind of

264
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,480
firm

265
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,680
and then

266
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,560
also the description or you know when

267
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,640
you work for companies with that by

268
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,079
engineering the future well-being of

269
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,839
humanity blah blah blah

270
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,880
that is literally lifted straight out of

271
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,839
the lockheed martian careers website so

272
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,480
there's a lot of really weird things

273
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,680
going on here

274
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,640
and

275
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
black alicante is generally coherent in

276
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
its lure documents so it almost feels

277
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,160
like the thread actor had an intern and

278
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
told the intern oh you know we need some

279
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,519
lyric documents so that's going to be

280
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,800
your project and then this is the result

281
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,000
but you know jokes aside um

282
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,959
one

283
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,880
hint about finding more black alicante

284
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,480
earlier documents is to examine the

285
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,000
machine um id of the link files this is

286
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,480
because unless the threat actor

287
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,640
decides to rip off the metadata the

288
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,200
machine link the machine id will

289
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
be the same across link files that have

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
been generated on the same system and

291
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,480
that can be very useful to identify

292
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,640
further samples indicators to block or

293
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,240
also to people on to find more of the

294
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,399
campaign

295
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,920
let's talk about infrastructure because

296
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
of course no malicious campaign is

297
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,399
complete without its infrastructure and

298
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,720
the third actor has very specific ways

299
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,160
of setting that up it registers domains

300
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
mostly through portfolio and these

301
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,880
domains

302
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
mostly mimic you know google drive

303
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,519
google cloud and microsoft cloud

304
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,519
products with this whole theme of like

305
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,519
oh i'm sharing a document with you or

306
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
i'm hosting a document for you or this

307
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,880
is the cloud service for xyz

308
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,720
and then the transactor might also

309
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
decide to impersonate specific

310
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
cryptocurrency companies for example

311
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
here on screen like towards the left

312
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,560
side you see um

313
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
several um cryptocurrency companies such

314
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,800
as fidelity digital assets being spoofed

315
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
but anyways after the introductory sets

316
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
up all these domains and registers them

317
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,959
it will point them likely to a same ip

318
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,160
address and so if you run passive dns on

319
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
a first domain that you've identified

320
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
find the ip and then run passive vienna

321
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,279
you can quite easily pivot around and

322
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,639
find much more of the campaign

323
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,240
infrastructure being used by the threat

324
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,120
actor

325
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,880
and sometimes the productor might

326
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
register an ssl certificate and then

327
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,480
deploy that on multiple servers that he

328
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,800
uses which again helps us we like when

329
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
introductors make these mistakes or

330
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,519
dismiss those miscalculations

331
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,079
speaking about servers and there are

332
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,560
several technology components that are

333
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,920
found on

334
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,399
servers that black alicante has set up

335
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
we should mention that whenever the

336
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,959
threat actor is using a specific ip

337
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,399
address

338
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,440
all the domains um on there will be

339
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
black alicante for specific for that

340
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,279
specific period of time

341
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,560
and you will also be able to notice when

342
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,040
black alicante was using that specific

343
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,279
server because there will be a set of

344
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,240
specific uh technology components being

345
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,360
installed

346
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,000
for example specific versions of apache

347
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,320
open ssl and php

348
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,079
that you can see here on screen the

349
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,240
productor will also leave open only a

350
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
few quarts uh four four three three

351
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,320
three eight nine eighty eighty

352
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,399
um and sometimes

353
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
rarely uh the protector might also use

354
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,959
temporarily uh 2150p four four five for

355
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,639
smb and 1433 for ms people which you

356
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,240
know are the kind of technologies that a

357
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,040
product uses to manage the server

358
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,480
you know i could talk about

359
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,800
infrastructure fingerprinting all day

360
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,519
but taki coder has actually given a

361
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,399
brilliant brilliant talk about

362
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,920
uh you know black alicanto's

363
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
infrastructure and so i would really

364
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,279
recommend that if you're interested in

365
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,480
this you go and watch that talk and or

366
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,399
at least read the presentation i have

367
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
linked it you know at the bottom of my

368
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,320
presentation like in the slides for the

369
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,760
references so you can find me there

370
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,720
so

371
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,880
so far at a glance we've given a decent

372
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,279
overview of what to expect about you

373
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,360
know the initial access spaces of black

374
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
alicanto's intrusions

375
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
we've talked about how to give it across

376
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,160
link files across your documents

377
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
um across domains and ip addresses as

378
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,720
well as how to use ssl certificates to

379
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
find further infrastructure but there is

380
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
one item that we have not touched on and

381
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
which i promised we would mention again

382
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,000
in this presentation

383
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,480
and that is mso rat

384
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,680
now msrat was so called by entity

385
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,199
security that gave a very good

386
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,760
presentation on crypto mimic that is

387
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,199
like alicante

388
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,160
and the characteristic of msoraj is that

389
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
not just pwc but several other companies

390
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,959
in the public domain have mentioned how

391
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,920
similar it is to backdoors employed by

392
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,720
lazarus group and more specifically by

393
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,680
the lazarus group subgroup known as blue

394
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,959
norov a financially motivated subgroup

395
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,839
so

396
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,000
i have included here some hashes of mso

397
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
rat that you can you know start pivoting

398
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
on to find more samples and do your own

399
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,360
analysis but just as an overview all of

400
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,600
these samples contain matching rc4

401
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,920
encryption routines same section

402
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,079
structure of the peas and same execution

403
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,199
flow

404
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,160
despite being packed so you know you

405
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,680
would have to unpack them to see with

406
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,360
that uh their facts would be unprotected

407
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,480
or they might have uh and

408
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,320
for example there is a definite

409
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,399
correspondence between msorad that

410
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,880
entity security talks about and the back

411
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,720
door mentioned by f-secure in their

412
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
report about lazarus targeting

413
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,639
cryptocurrency it's you know highly

414
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,320
likely the same backdoor just slightly

415
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,519
modified

416
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,000
and likewise f-secure in attributing

417
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,639
this to lazarus group pointed to an

418
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,399
almost identical bacteria having already

419
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,399
been deployed in operation kill disc

420
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
while clear sky in their analysis of

421
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,079
msora pointed out that this backdoor and

422
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,040
had the same codebase as a 2016 blooner

423
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,480
of samples and

424
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
wheel that's a long pedigree for a

425
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,920
backdoor you know

426
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,839
even through all these changes to find

427
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,680
connections back to 2016 codebase is

428
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,839
a definitely interesting link

429
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,440
so you know malware is never enough for

430
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,279
attribution i would caution anyone

431
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,959
against thinking that malware alone is

432
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,040
sufficient to attribute activity so i

433
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,120
decided to look at the infrastructure

434
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,279
and what i noticed is that starting from

435
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,680
a cluster of faster latex little link

436
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,440
files um

437
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
that are dated around 2020

438
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,120
if we run passive dns on the initial

439
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,160
situ

440
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,120
servers we could basically get back

441
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,199
really quickly to domains that were

442
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,079
being used as initial access domains by

443
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,959
f secures uh you know by lazers in the

444
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,240
report published by f-secure and other

445
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,559
lasers infrastructure so you know it all

446
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,480
comes full circle it's not just amazon

447
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,000
it's also infrastructure that you can

448
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
give it across and at the same time

449
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,799
f-secure in publishing this buzzer's

450
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,720
report was also calling back the

451
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,199
activity mentioning dangerous password

452
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,760
which is an alias for black alicante so

453
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,559
you know we've come full circle if we

454
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,960
take a step back and we examine this at

455
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,880
a higher level perspective using the

456
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,799
diamond model of intrusion analysis

457
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,799
which is a great framework

458
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,600
for um performing structured clustering

459
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,000
of intrusion sets we can actually see

460
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,039
several similarities between the kind of

461
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,520
lazer subgroup lunarof at least in the

462
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,720
ways described in several reports by

463
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
like a secure for example and black

464
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,320
alicante

465
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,679
we see the use of bidly links of uh

466
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,039
several domains having the xyz top-level

467
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
domain which is not really common we

468
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,799
also see domain-speaking microsoft and

469
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,280
google and like the theme of hosting or

470
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,559
cloud

471
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,200
and cryptocurrency themes as well

472
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,600
um although black alicanto maybe focuses

473
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,840
more on the pork ban registrar while it

474
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,679
has not been seen as much in um lunarof

475
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,320
we also see the corresponding you know

476
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,240
initial access intrusion chain with the

477
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,160
password.txt

478
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,240
file and several stage of bb script

479
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,799
files the use of msoraj and of course

480
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,640
the targeting the targeting matches

481
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,840
which is the cryptocurrency and

482
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
financial sector for financially

483
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,799
motivated purposes although

484
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,039
the targeting itself is international

485
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,440
and geographically distributed

486
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,559
so we have overlaps across capabilities

487
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,520
infrastructure and victims so i would

488
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,160
say that that's enough to have at least

489
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,799
you know a fairly confident assessment

490
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,080
that what might be the case from our

491
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,480
internal visibility and collection and

492
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,880
open source evidence presented that

493
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
black alicante dangerous password

494
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,400
intrusion set

495
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,840
is highly likely a subset

496
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,799
or a spin-off subgroup

497
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,520
of blunderoff that is in itself a

498
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,840
subgroup of what is known as the lazarus

499
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,559
umbrella

500
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,960
i know i know it's a lot to take in so

501
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,240
we can take a bit of a breath and it's a

502
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
lot of information and that's why i'm

503
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,679
glad that it should be recorded so

504
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,120
hopefully you can watch it and make

505
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,039
sense of what i'm saying

506
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,960
but i also promised that we were going

507
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
to talk about black touch too so if

508
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
that's the right i'm going to move on

509
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,960
and talk to you a bit about that

510
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,000
so plactive 2 is another reactor that

511
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
targets cryptocurrency and this is the

512
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,440
kind of intrusion chain that you can

513
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,799
expect to see if you're ever targeted by

514
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,799
or if you're ever tracking black theft

515
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,600
ii now in some cases the protector might

516
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,760
send a phishing email with a compressed

517
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,720
um archive in some cases the third actor

518
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
just delivers in some way a malicious

519
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,720
document lure to the victim of interest

520
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,640
this malicious document actually is um

521
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,360
built to weaponize remote template

522
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,480
injection

523
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,640
what that means is that once the victim

524
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,280
opens the malicious document

525
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,559
and this will fetch a remote template

526
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,720
from a remote server that is the first

527
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,880
stage command and control and payload

528
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,559
staging server

529
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,320
and this remote template will have

530
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,240
malicious macros in it

531
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,640
what the macros will do is that they

532
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,440
will look for a picture inside the

533
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,520
original malicious document

534
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,640
decode it into an executable payload

535
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,159
load the dll into memory by process

536
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,280
injection

537
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,960
and then this yellow will connect back

538
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,039
to the command and control server

539
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,080
and then it's only at this point if the

540
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,159
victim is of interest because the cll

541
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,640
payload is a profiler a victim profiler

542
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,919
if the victim is of interest the

543
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,840
transactor might decide to then deploy

544
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,480
manually further capabilities including

545
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,159
yes i know you've guessed it already

546
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,400
amazon

547
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
now if we look at how black death two

548
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
fishes um targets this reductor that is

549
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,679
active since at least august 2020 and

550
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,840
that is known as operation gold counting

551
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,159
and operations last crypto as first

552
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,400
actually clusters these two threat

553
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,960
actors contemplative two together

554
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,120
the third actor um

555
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,200
has made a few mistakes over time that

556
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,559
allows us to connect its campaigns

557
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,039
one of them is using very similar word

558
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,520
templates across all the newer documents

559
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,440
minted by its operators

560
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
and one of these is insert your first

561
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,159
table of contents tutorial.x

562
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,760
so if you pivot on that you will

563
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,000
actually be able to find um malicious

564
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,159
viewer documents that perform remote

565
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,240
template injection that are the black

566
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,520
theft two ones

567
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,120
in terms of themes that the productor

568
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,280
uses the titles are generally

569
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
referencing and the contents

570
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,039
non-disclosure agreements

571
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,600
um iso

572
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,440
27001 which is really ironic because as

573
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,360
information security professionals you

574
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,679
will know that this is the standard for

575
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,440
information securities it's quite funny

576
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,080
that the product mentions that

577
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,480
a lot of documents will purport to be

578
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,039
protected protected by microsoft azure

579
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,360
protected by kaspersky as you can see on

580
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,840
the first lure from the top

581
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,559
and a lot of actual um lure documents

582
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,039
will be seen around presentations or

583
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,880
pitches as if the transactor was trying

584
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,919
to get funding um or venture capital

585
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,840
from some investors

586
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,000
there are also overlaps not just on the

587
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,679
themes but on the

588
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,919
monikers or authors that the trade

589
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,880
actors operators have left in so if we

590
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,640
look at this that's actually a very good

591
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,039
way of pivoting around your documents

592
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,520
if you peel it around an author metadata

593
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,159
of nord you will find several malicious

594
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,679
documents doing remote template

595
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
injection that are black black death

596
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,480
tools

597
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,679
if you peel around the author never you

598
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,600
will also find several malicious

599
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,120
documents doing remote temporary

600
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,200
injection that are black tools and

601
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,880
several of these actually overlapping

602
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,039
the themes that they use so there are

603
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,360
several items that you can use to pivot

604
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,080
around and find more black tattoo

605
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,159
documents and from there you can find

606
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,320
more infrastructure

607
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
if we talk a tiny bit about the macros

608
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,400
and the dll payload what the malicious

609
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,600
macros in the remote template exactly do

610
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,200
is roughly you know they locate a

611
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,600
resource in the original file then they

612
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
decode this image they basically turn it

613
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,760
into a you know pe format

614
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,720
and then they inject this payload which

615
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,080
is a dll into either a system process or

616
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,919
another process that is maybe hard coded

617
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,320
such as a notified plus plus

618
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,760
the dll payload itself is 32-bit it's

619
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
packed with the mida at least the one we

620
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,919
have observed but it might also be

621
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,640
packed with vm protect for example um

622
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,240
its name is generally the fault the rdp

623
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,840
although the protector can easily change

624
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,600
that and it is

625
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,279
roughly a victim profiler and a back

626
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,080
door and i've included um a hash for you

627
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,000
below so you can start pivoting around

628
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,919
and see naturally and find more samples

629
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
if you're interested

630
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,400
in terms of you know

631
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,840
the back door

632
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,440
that

633
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,000
the full rdp deploys there is actually

634
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
more it's always uh you know an

635
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,240
intrusion chain with several steps

636
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,240
we have seen at least two cases where um

637
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,039
mso rat was deployed um through um

638
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,240
before the rdp manually and we have

639
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,080
identified at least two samples of

640
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,840
masonry that we assess were used for

641
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,279
black f2

642
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,159
and

643
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
essentially msrat is

644
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,919
packed

645
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,320
like in the other cases we observed this

646
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,640
variant has the same exported functions

647
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,320
and as we have seen for example in black

648
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,559
alicantes and lazarus payloads it has

649
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,320
the same structure and sections same

650
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,520
visible strings not only it even hits on

651
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,000
our yara rules that we made for some

652
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,159
lazarus malicious dlls back in 2017 so

653
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,960
again quite a long pedigree here for

654
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
this code base and this backdoor so at

655
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
this point we're left with three

656
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,080
different productors

657
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,720
different maybe not so much uh using

658
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,760
msoraj and those are lunarof the subset

659
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,600
of lazarus group which we call black

660
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,640
artemis

661
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,039
black alicante which we assess to be a

662
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,679
subset or spinoff of lunarof

663
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,320
and lactep2

664
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,559
but we have to hold our horses because

665
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,480
we have said that we will not attribute

666
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,080
based on our alone because that would be

667
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
a tragic mistake so let's look at

668
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,440
something else before

669
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
let's look at the infrastructure the

670
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,720
black district uses so you can recognize

671
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,640
it fingerprint it hunt for it protect

672
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,520
from it so the product will register

673
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,840
domains that imitate a specific

674
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,679
investment or cryptocurrency entities

675
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,240
for example

676
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,640
abcbc.japan.net uh avsbc is an actual uh

677
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,520
japanese venture capital company um this

678
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,360
attractor might also register domains

679
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,600
that imitate microsoft or google or

680
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,919
cloud or file storage systems you know

681
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,520
you see here uh protect azure.com

682
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
or domains that might be a mix of the

683
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,480
two naming schemas above so you see here

684
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,480
protect.uncapital.us

685
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
again this threat actor as well

686
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,200
blackdiff 2 as well just like black

687
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
alicante register is a bunch of domains

688
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,200
although this sort actor prefers

689
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,520
namecheap and name silo instead of port

690
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,880
one and will point um several of these

691
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,279
domains to the same ip address

692
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,760
so again passive dns is your friend if

693
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,360
you want to find

694
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,440
further infrastructure and malware being

695
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,919
used in a blacked out view campaign just

696
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
rely on passing dns and that's a really

697
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,360
good start

698
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,520
in terms of the server and the

699
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,279
technology components that are deployed

700
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
in these servers we see again that

701
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,120
blackdev2 also likes to use apache

702
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,039
openssl and php on windows 64 machines

703
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,200
with specific versions

704
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,279
now you know you can tell me about you

705
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,120
know literally like everyone under the

706
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,760
sun uses apache pssl and php that's not

707
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,679
groundbreaking and i'm gonna absolutely

708
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,039
agree with you

709
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,000
um i'm just saying that it's interesting

710
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,760
to see two threat actors like black

711
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,080
alicante and black dev2

712
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,679
building infrastructure in a very

713
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,279
similar way registering their own

714
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
domains with very similar themes and

715
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,559
keywords

716
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,240
in presenting cryptocurrency companies

717
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,799
and deploying the same technologies

718
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,799
just slightly different versions on

719
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,840
their servers but i'm saying and this is

720
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,039
also useful

721
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,480
because if you identify some

722
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,039
infrastructure that might be black f2

723
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,960
and you're not quite sure looking at the

724
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,720
technology components deployed on the

725
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,039
server might actually help you give that

726
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,039
confidence that you're actually looking

727
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,399
at black vector infrastructure

728
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,159
and black dev 2 as well makes some

729
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,080
operational security mistakes when it

730
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,480
comes to certificates so for example in

731
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,080
at least one case we observe the threat

732
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,559
actor registering an ssl certificate for

733
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,039
one domain and then deploying it on a

734
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,440
whole bunch of others so that definitely

735
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,159
helps finding you know the broader scope

736
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,679
of the campaign so whenever you find

737
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,840
mistakes like this it's very useful to

738
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,159
exploit them for your own um

739
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,640
intelligence purposes

740
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,760
so at a glance if we wrap this up a bit

741
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,960
we've actually

742
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,080
also built a decent picture of what you

743
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,720
might see if black death 2 targets your

744
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
company or if you're attracting black

745
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,320
death 2 this is kind of roughly what you

746
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,240
can expect to see in the initial stages

747
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,840
of an intrusion

748
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,679
and something i forgot to mention is

749
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,039
that the ip addresses that black dev 2

750
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,360
uses to set up its command control

751
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,080
servers are mostly on host wins so

752
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,320
that's another item that you can use for

753
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,919
tracking and fingerprinting

754
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,480
in terms of the entities that blackdev2

755
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,200
has impersonated so far well there are

756
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,960
several batches of documents and each of

757
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,039
them in personally different entities

758
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,159
right but what's interesting is that all

759
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,000
of these companies operate either

760
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,240
directly in the cryptocurrency vertical

761
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,960
or in the venture capital investment or

762
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,279
financial services sectors

763
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,279
but companies that have a specific

764
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,320
interest or investment in blockchain and

765
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,159
cryptocurrency as well as other more

766
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,480
like cutting-edge technologies so that's

767
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
an element to keep in mind in terms of

768
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,520
understanding how the product operates

769
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,600
the distribution of these companies is

770
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,679
quite international the companies

771
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,720
impersonated are mainly in japan and

772
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,360
partly because japan is a heavy user and

773
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,000
adopter of cryptocurrency and the

774
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
industry is just starting now to be

775
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,600
regulated freely

776
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,919
but there is also a lot of companies

777
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,919
impersonated in the united states

778
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,600
particularly in the venture capital

779
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,320
space as well as you know all around the

780
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,159
globe really on an international scale

781
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,240
you can see a map on screen of that

782
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,640
so i have a little easter egg for you

783
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,399
you know they say that time is money so

784
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,520
i decided to spend uh my time and my

785
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,840
company's money plotting all the

786
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,399
creation and last modified times of the

787
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,760
year documents used by blackdev2

788
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
and

789
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
you know you can ask me why does that

790
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,919
really matter is it really useful

791
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,880
i would say yes that overall timeline in

792
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,520
campaigns and timelining artifacts like

793
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
the creation and last modified times of

794
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,720
your documents

795
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,120
or stuff like the compile-time sample

796
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,799
binaries can give a good picture of a

797
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,960
campaign does it operate in matches is

798
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,760
it active um every day a little bit

799
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,399
but of course it also depends on the uh

800
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,440
on the maturity of your organization if

801
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,279
you work on an organization maybe has a

802
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,519
very small security team and is really

803
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,080
setting up its security program and

804
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,880
focusing on the basics like patching a

805
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,679
securing systems that's completely fine

806
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,200
and then this might not be as relevant

807
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,240
to you

808
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,679
on the other hand if you're a more

809
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,519
mature consumer of threat intelligence

810
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,799
maybe you have your spare intelligence

811
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,279
program this will be more useful because

812
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,159
it can be an element towards attribution

813
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,679
now let's look at these compile

814
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,000
timestamps or well creation and modify

815
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
timestamps you can see um on the bottom

816
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,360
left on the screen

817
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,919
when i was plotting them in utc there

818
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,480
was a peak between um you know midnight

819
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,440
and 4 a.m then between five four and

820
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,799
five and then uh you know until 5 p.m

821
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,840
uh and then between 5 p.m and 11 p.m

822
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,640
absolutely nothing zero

823
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,039
which you know is very interesting you

824
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,760
know there can be night owls that um

825
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,080
work all night and then some part of the

826
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,480
day and then sleep in the afternoon we

827
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,919
don't judge anyone everyone has their

828
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,760
own working patterns

829
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,399
but also this kind of look like maybe if

830
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,960
i adjust the time zone it might

831
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
feel a little bit of a more

832
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,960
working pattern if you get what i mean

833
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,640
so that's what i did

834
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,320
i plotted um this time these timings in

835
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,039
very different time zones and

836
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,559
um what i landed on ultimately was gmt

837
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,200
plus nine and that is korean standard

838
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,240
time

839
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,120
the reason for that is because no near

840
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,200
neighbors of this time zone actually

841
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,720
come close to having such a neat pattern

842
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,320
what you can see on screen is that the

843
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,559
creation and last modified times of the

844
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,440
44 viewer documents by black test 2 that

845
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,640
we found

846
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,519
actually have a very similar graph

847
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,120
there is

848
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,159
you know close to no activity between um

849
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,760
roughly 11 p.m midnight and then 8 9 a.m

850
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,360
almost zero

851
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,720
and then there is a peak between like 9

852
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,799
and 12 or 9 and like 1 p.m and then in

853
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,720
both graphs between

854
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,080
12 to 2 p.m or like maybe 1 to 2 p.m

855
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,440
nothing

856
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,600
nothing i mean i wouldn't want anyone to

857
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,960
spoil my lunch break either if you know

858
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,000
what i mean

859
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
and then the activity resumes there is

860
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,279
in both graphs no uh activity recorded

861
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,519
between 8 and 9 pm in korean standard

862
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,519
time and then maybe a tiny bit of

863
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,080
activity before nothingness against the

864
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,600
next morning

865
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,120
so you know

866
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,519
of course uh timelining is not a silver

867
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,200
bullet you can't really use it for

868
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
attribution just by itself

869
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,840
but you can make two hypotheses and one

870
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,519
is that there is a threat actor black

871
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,760
tattoo somewhere in the world that has

872
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,159
operated for at least a year an entire

873
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,039
campaign in korean standard time maybe

874
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,039
purposefully as a red herring or maybe

875
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,880
its operator is just really like

876
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,559
sleeping in the afternoon

877
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,840
or the threat actor is based in korea

878
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,919
and dare i say based on the other

879
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,679
characteristics that we've seen of black

880
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,720
death 2 likely based in north korea

881
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,120
so

882
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,760
we have given an overview of black

883
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,840
alicante we've given an overview of

884
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,399
black dev2 and we highlighted several

885
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,079
connections that these products might

886
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,839
have to last group which we call black

887
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,320
artemis and specifically its subgroup

888
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,399
lunarof so let's connect the dots a bit

889
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,280
on one hand we have black alicanto the

890
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,000
subset of black artemis lunarof uh and

891
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,760
black dev two all using msrat as you

892
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,000
know an advanced payload deployed all

893
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,839
new victims of interest

894
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,520
then we have uh in terms of

895
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,879
infrastructure

896
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,239
black alicante and lunarof overlapping

897
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,320
in terms of their initial access command

898
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
and control infrastructure as we

899
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,839
mentioned there are several cases where

900
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,839
you can pivot back from blackley county

901
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,399
initial access domains to

902
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,399
lazarus initial access domains as

903
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,560
attributed by a secure

904
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,839
in terms of black dev2 we can actually

905
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,400
have an interesting connection in the

906
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,920
sense that the domain abc dot info

907
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,240
resolved roughly at the same time to the

908
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,680
same ip address that

909
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,680
pokersonic.publicvm.com

910
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,839
resolved to and this domain the

911
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,520
pokersonic was actually used as a

912
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,400
command control server for a sample of

913
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,440
the mso rat variant that we said you

914
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,000
know that actually looks like lazarus

915
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,400
but then msrat is also deployed by

916
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,599
lactif2

917
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,359
and then between black alicante and

918
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,440
black dev2 we have tooth reductors that

919
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,400
use a very similar domain naming schema

920
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
uh down to the top level domains that

921
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,560
they use they make similar mistakes with

922
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,680
ssl certificates deploy similar even

923
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,560
though not identical server components

924
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,520
both really like to just um have

925
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,240
neat chains of passive dns connections i

926
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,680
really hope they're not listening

927
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,280
because and if you do you know if you're

928
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,720
listening please do not actually you

929
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,960
don't change that we love that um and

930
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,160
also

931
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,920
you know blooner off black alicante and

932
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,240
black f2 would also all have an interest

933
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,560
in cryptocurrency

934
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,720
so if we plot that again using the

935
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,079
diamond model

936
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,839
and and i realized this is a lot of

937
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,680
information so you can absolutely go and

938
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,119
reread this in your own time if you're

939
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,240
interested we have overlaps across not

940
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,400
just capabilities but also

941
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,760
infrastructure

942
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,320
and victims and it almost seems

943
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,480
sometimes like plactive 2 might be a bit

944
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,640
of an evolution in the trade craft that

945
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,560
black alicante uses

946
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,200
so our assessment at pwc you know and

947
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,280
this is entirely dependent on our

948
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,760
internal visibility collection and the

949
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,440
evidence that is publicly available

950
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,200
other companies might have different

951
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,480
visibility

952
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,880
we assess that black death two

953
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,680
is actually likely to be the same threat

954
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,920
actor as black alicante and we have

955
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,720
already assessed that black alicanto is

956
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,320
highly likely

957
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,440
um

958
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,119
a subset or a spin-off group of

959
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,079
lunarov which is in itself a subgroup of

960
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,480
the lazarus umbrella

961
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,720
yeah i know right it's uh it's a lot to

962
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,400
take in there's there's

963
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,960
a lot of analytical work going on here

964
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,079
and let's repeat that for a moment black

965
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,880
dev two operation gold hunting

966
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,440
is likely the same third actor as black

967
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,839
alicante dangerous password

968
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,800
which we assess to be in fact

969
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,560
a subset or a spin-off of bloomer off

970
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,240
yep that's a lot

971
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,920
so i'd like to

972
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
touch on a couple things on this topic

973
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,400
and one of them is that black artemis

974
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,560
lazarus group is a productor that is

975
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,119
capable of building highly sophisticated

976
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,560
payloads

977
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,720
and you know it's possible to trace a

978
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,680
whole

979
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,000
uh pedigree in its code base and that is

980
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,920
also the threat actor is achilles heel

981
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,880
the code based reuse is what continues

982
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,160
to allow analysts to build connections

983
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,720
across newer and older black artemis

984
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,560
operations so whenever you encounter

985
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,680
payloads signature them build arrows

986
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,400
build detections and you know leave them

987
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,839
there for some time because you might

988
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,160
never know they might surprise you the

989
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,760
2017 rule hitting on 2021 payloads was

990
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,040
really interesting for us from an

991
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,960
analytic perspective

992
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,040
and in terms of the focus on

993
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,720
cryptocurrency by several north korea

994
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,040
based transactors well

995
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,240
you know

996
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,920
that's not gonna wait that's not gonna

997
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,640
go anytime soon illegal financing is an

998
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,119
existential imperative for north korea

999
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,680
and for north korea based right actors

1000
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,480
so

1001
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,640
so long as the price of cryptocurrency

1002
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
continues to rise so long as the

1003
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,560
industry is not well

1004
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,040
regulated yet so long as it's not

1005
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,440
sufficiently protected and so long as

1006
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,839
it's hard to recover the funds we can

1007
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,400
