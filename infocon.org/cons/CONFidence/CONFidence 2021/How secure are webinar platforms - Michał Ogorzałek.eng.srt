1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,960
hi everybody once again my name is

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,920
michael kojawek i work in securing as an

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,480
i.t security consultant where i mainly

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,239
perform security tests of web

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,600
applications

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,240
and last year i had an opportunity to

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,960
hack webinar platforms

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
just for you to know webinar platforms

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,760
are slightly different from standard web

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,679
conference platforms

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,000
the webinar platforms typically the

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,480
presenter speaks to the appendix and

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,960
webinar attendees do not interact with

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,800
one another

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
the popularity of webinars webinars was

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,960
already rising before the current

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,760
pademic it is hard to give you accurate

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,120
statistics now but in 2020 the number of

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,920
webinars grew

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,960
162 percent so winners are more and more

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
popular

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,520
okay i was hacking webinar platforms

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,079
but not because i'm bad and i like

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,680
breaking things

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,240
so let me start with our story

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
everybody realize that pandemic has

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,360
changed the world

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,040
most of our communication with the

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,000
client presentations and training

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
had to be transferred to the remote

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,560
world so our company started looking for

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,799
a suitable platform which would enable

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,640
us to provide knowledge to our clients

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,000
and

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
one of our colleagues prepared for us

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,439
webinar using third-party platform to

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,400
test its possibilities

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,720
he was the host and the presenter

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,119
we were attendees

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
he was talking

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,399
sharing his screen

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,880
showing us the whiteboard

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
and after five minutes of the webinar

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
strange things started to happen

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,600
firstly

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,439
somebody wrote in decent words on the

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,600
webinar's whiteboard

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,880
then

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
my colleague was the host and the

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,800
presenter was kicked out of the meeting

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
and instead of him another of my

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
colleagues became

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,040
a host

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,239
i've already knew what happened we are

55
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,120
pentesters we are hackers for hire and

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,920
during the webinar my colleagues started

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
hacking the webinar platforms

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,120
and with their platform and one of them

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
managed to find and exploit

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,319
vulnerabilities in just a few minutes

61
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,400
since the platform was not secure enough

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,280
we decided to find another one however

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,200
the problem happened again

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,040
second platform also had crucial

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,160
vulnerabilities and those company owners

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,040
asked me and my colleague

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,080
jacob correcta to press the hack button

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,640
and verify the security of other other

69
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,080
platforms

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
to get a view of how safe other label

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,159
solutions are

72
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,560
before we begin we have defined

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,400
assumptions of our research

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,840
we've selected selected the most popular

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
webinar platforms based on the majestic

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
million and spent spend about an hour

77
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,040
per platform testing

78
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,760
we are hacking real application right

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
so not to break the law

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,799
we are we're testing from only one

81
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,799
account on a platform

82
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,120
and only data related to the test

83
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,640
account was accessed

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,319
a lot of things can go wrong in the

85
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,200
context of webinar security however our

86
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,720
main goal was to

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,760
gain the host or presenter privilege

88
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
either by

89
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,799
an anonymous attacker or by an attendee

90
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,439
of a mythic

91
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
before i start let me explain how

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,120
webinar platforms work

93
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,200
generally webinar platforms are web

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
applications

95
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,640
and they use http protocol for

96
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
communication between

97
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,879
browser

98
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
and server client and server

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
a browser sends an http request to the

100
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,280
server

101
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,960
and gets an http response based on this

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
response

103
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
a user interface

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,960
of the application is created in the

105
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
browser

106
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,919
but

107
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,000
it is not enough when operations are to

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,479
be performed in real time

109
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
to keep every participant up to date

110
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,520
with the meeting data the message is

111
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,560
being sent the the user being kicked

112
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,400
out etc another protocol is used

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
namely web socket

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,919
for you youtube

115
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,600
for you to remember is that the

116
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,360
websocket protocol is bi-directional and

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
while using it we create a connection

118
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,440
between a client browser

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
and a server

120
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,840
so messages can be sent

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,960
in both

122
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,599
directions

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
for example

124
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,400
if a host sends a message or

125
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
mutes a participant websocket protocol

126
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
is used to inform

127
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,039
all participants about the change okay

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
during our test we encountered a whole

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,639
range of lunar vulnerabilities but we

130
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,840
focused mainly on three aspects

131
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,560
privilege escalation either by role

132
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
modification or by access control issues

133
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,960
or sensitive information in the browser

134
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,560
it is a sensitive data of attendees or

135
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
private conversations

136
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,319
okay

137
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,479
so let's start hacking

138
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,160
how hard is to become a host

139
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
i see this button

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,919
i click this button

141
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,680
and i join a webinar

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,479
then i intercept

143
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,759
messages between my browser

144
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,639
and the application server

145
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,680
analyzing messages i see that there is a

146
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
very interesting parameter in

147
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
communication

148
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,199
they're wrong

149
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
what do you think

150
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
what can i do with this

151
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,199
i can change the value of the parameter

152
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,759
to host or to press enter

153
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,080
depending on the platform

154
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,440
so let's change the value of the

155
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,800
parameter

156
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
now let's wait a few seconds till the

157
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
resources are loaded

158
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,080
and

159
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
i am a host

160
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
i am false

161
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,759
that's all

162
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,000
the user interface is is generated for

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,039
the host

164
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,840
i can perform all operations

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,400
i can share my screen and i can even

166
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,360
kick the former host out of the meeting

167
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
i am the owner of the mythic

168
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
all i had to do was modify the value of

169
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,360
one parameter related to the role

170
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,440
of a user easy right

171
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,479
we've tested 14 platforms overall

172
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,560
and in two of them it was possible to

173
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,039
become a host of a webinar in such a

174
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,440
trivial way

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,120
okay

176
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,680
it was in two platforms but what about

177
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
the rest

178
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,120
even if the application does not allow

179
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,840
user to modify the rows it still can

180
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,720
have access control issues

181
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,440
as we can see

182
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
some of the functions are available only

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
for administrators also presenters

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,479
for example making another user a

185
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,120
presenter

186
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
as an attendee

187
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
i cannot use this function in user

188
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
interface

189
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,879
however

190
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
by using by using the websocket

191
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,720
connection that i have between my

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,680
browser and the application server

193
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
i can send

194
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,159
this prepared web socket message and add

195
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,519
new presenter

196
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
okay i execute the function at the new

197
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,760
presenter

198
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,919
and this is my id

199
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,120
okay

200
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,640
i sent this message and

201
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
i have a presenter

202
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,760
okay i added myself as a present

203
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
what can i do now

204
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,320
i can send

205
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,880
another websocket message and execute

206
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
other function

207
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
to kick

208
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,200
kick through host out of the meeting

209
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,959
i execute other function black user

210
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,439
and this is id of john truehost

211
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,480
i send this message

212
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,959
and voila

213
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,080
post is kicked out

214
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
i couldn't modify the role just like

215
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
before however the result is exactly the

216
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
same the host is kicked out of the

217
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
meeting and i have full control over the

218
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,880
webinar all i did was send two websocket

219
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,160
messages

220
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,640
that's all

221
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,000
it all results from a complete lack of

222
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,760
access control

223
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,360
server hasn't

224
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,160
verified the privileges and i was able

225
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,279
to execute administration functions

226
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,240
during our test we we've noticed a very

227
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,920
interesting thing in most cases access

228
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,160
control in http communication was

229
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
implemented properly

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,120
however not in websocket messages

231
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,959
if we found some application and a

232
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,519
vulnerable the problem was global there

233
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,399
was no access control in any function

234
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
that uses web sockets

235
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,920
and not counting and documenting

236
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,079
application that we have simply by wrong

237
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,360
modification

238
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,760
three other head access control issues

239
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,640
which allowed us to escalate privileges

240
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
third common vulnerability that we found

241
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,040
was sensitive information in the browser

242
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
for example

243
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,680
a webinar administrator or host

244
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,640
has access to personal data of personal

245
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,800
data of attendees like full name like

246
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,160
email date the date of the birth almost

247
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,560
everything that was supplied during

248
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
registration

249
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
attendees

250
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
can see only nicknames

251
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
however

252
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
the data is sent to the browser of every

253
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,800
attendee

254
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
the client site application

255
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,279
decide whether the data should be

256
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,880
displayed

257
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,279
or not

258
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,160
so

259
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
if attendees analyze the traffic that

260
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,120
comes to their browsers

261
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,480
they will access the data

262
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,839
similar when sending private messages

263
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,760
during the webinar

264
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,720
user 2 is not able to see in the browser

265
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,839
messages

266
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,920
that are sent

267
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,200
to user

268
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
1

269
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,079
however

270
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,120
the message is sent to every single

271
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
attendee

272
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,959
and

273
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,560
by analyzing the traffic that comes to

274
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,680
the browser they can read them

275
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
they can read

276
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,839
this private message

277
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,079
got it

278
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
guess how many platforms had

279
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,360
vulnerabilities related to sensitive

280
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
information exposure

281
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
half of them

282
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
we also found other vulnerability

283
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,120
vulnerabilities which allowed for

284
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
example spooping messages or bypassing a

285
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
client site validation

286
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,399
a lot a lot of other things can go wrong

287
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,880
in the context of the webinar security

288
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,959
but we we

289
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,519
cannot cover it all during our

290
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,880
presentation

291
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,920
so let's sum up

292
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,560
we've tested 14 platforms overall and in

293
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,120
five of them we were able to escalate

294
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
our privileges

295
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
either

296
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,480
simply by role modification or

297
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,320
by exploiting access control issues

298
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,200
and half of the tested platforms head

299
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
vulnerabilities related related to

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,399
sensitive information exposure

301
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,880
the next step was to convey details of

302
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,720
vulnerabilities to appropriate people

303
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,480
responsible for security of these

304
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,000
solutions

305
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,880
as it turned out it was harder than

306
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,920
harder than finding backs

307
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,079
as since there was no dedica security

308
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,200
that dedicated contact on any website

309
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,399
our first shot was technical support

310
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,399
obviously details of security

311
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,399
vulnerabilities could not be passed to a

312
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,959
random person from support right

313
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,040
so we pushed for giving as a contact to

314
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,199
a person responsible for for the

315
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,959
security

316
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,199
it looks like that

317
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,440
so we would like to we would like to

318
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
inform that there is a serious serious

319
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,839
vulnerability in the application and an

320
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,079
attendee can become a presenter without

321
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,560
privileges could you give us a contact

322
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
to person responsible for security

323
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,839
please

324
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,440
and they respond with something like

325
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,639
okay

326
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,800
this is the security issue we are able

327
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,719
to bypass your security mechanism

328
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
maybe in some other worlds

329
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,279
this is dangerous for users of your

330
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,279
application could you give us a contact

331
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,240
to security please

332
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,079
hmm let's click the link

333
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,279
there is no contact information here

334
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,040
maybe you can escalate the problem and

335
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,719
contact me with some technical people

336
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,560
don't try to talk with support about

337
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,079
technical stuff it's completely useless

338
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,000
sometimes we weren't getting any

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,399
response and when we got it was the same

340
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,040
story over and over again

341
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,279
not technical people were not able to

342
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,320
understand the problem and there was no

343
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,480
process to handle to handle a

344
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,839
vulnerability

345
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,680
reporting because of that we started

346
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,519
looking for a person responsible for

347
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,720
security

348
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,880
or at least let's say let's say

349
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,320
a competent person in linkedin

350
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,639
it was definitely a better solution and

351
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,399
in the end we managed to report

352
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
vulnerabilities to four companies two of

353
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,639
them fixed vulnerabilities in a week

354
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,480
the third one fixed them partially in a

355
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,959
month at the last one has not fixed

356
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,639
vulnerabilities

357
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,639
yet

358
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,160
okay

359
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,519
that's it

360
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,480
i hope that our research showed that

361
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,320
sometimes it is enough for security

362
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,680
specialists like me or or like jaku to

363
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
spend an hour to find critical

364
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
vulnerabilities

365
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,720
and i would like you to remember that

366
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,680
similarly to other sas applications

367
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,839
webinar platforms also have

368
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,560
vulnerabilities

369
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
security tests should involve all

370
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,920
applications

371
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,800
including those provided by external

372
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,720
vendors

373
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,079
and

374
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,600
vulnerabilities happen in application

375
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,440
from my point of view

376
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,600
very important is

377
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
how how these vulnerabilities are

378
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,079
handled if they are handled

379
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,040
let's say

380
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,160
how much a company cares about security

381
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,959
the problems that i talked about today

382
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,199
are not limited to just webinar

383
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,759
platforms but also many other web

384
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,120
applications

385
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,720
for example for example chat for example

386
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,160
a help desk or online training generally

387
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,880
all web applications which use websocket

388
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,959
for instant two-way communication with

389
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,199
the browser

390
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,959
most of the vulnerabilities that we

391
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,359
found were caused by lack of access

392
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,240
control and like i said like i said

393
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,559
earlier during our test many

394
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,400
applications had access control

395
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
implemented properly for http

396
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,079
communication but not for websockets

397
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,640
so if you have a similar application

398
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,720
remember please to implement access

399
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,720
control also for web sockets

400
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,760
and do not send and not send excessive

401
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,559
data to users if users are privileged to

402
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,919
see only names

403
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,039
send them only names

404
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,240
a verified server side

405
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,039
server side if a user has privileges to

406
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,760
access data or perform an operation

407
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,960
do not rely on client side on clean site

408
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,320
validation and it can be easily bypassed

409
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,120
and perform security tests and do threat

410
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,679
modelling to detect vulnerabilities in

411
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,200
your applications

412
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,919
and

413
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,840
train your developers to prevent

414
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,760
vulnerabilities

415
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,480
if they understand them and know how to

416
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,840
write secure code it is less likely that

417
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,160
that they will create code with

418
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,039
vulnerabilities

419
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,360
i guess it's all

420
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
i hope that you enjoyed our story

421
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,559
and remember please if something is

422
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,440
popular and publicly available it is not

423
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,880
necessarily well tested and secure

424
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,200
thank you very much for your attention

425
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,480
and let's go back to the studio
