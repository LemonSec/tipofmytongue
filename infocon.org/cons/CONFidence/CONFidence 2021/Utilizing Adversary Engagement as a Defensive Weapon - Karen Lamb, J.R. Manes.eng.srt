1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,280
okay

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,280
uh all right i think our i think our

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,119
slides are on here so

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:17,920
um

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
we've hidden our video here uh so we can

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,560
uh just focus have everyone focus on our

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,080
content and then at the end we'll we'll

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,599
take some questions and you'll be able

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,880
to see us again

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,039
uh so i'm jr uh if you couldn't have

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,960
guessed that um karen is uh here with me

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
uh in london we're both based in london

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,920
actually here let me just jump to our

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,600
next slide here

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480
um we are from hsbc's global cyber

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,160
intelligence team so we are the team

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
that represents uh all the countries in

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,800
which hsbc operates um if anyone's

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,640
confused on where poland is i've put a

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,719
marker there which which helps me which

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,640
i realized just before this talk is not

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,039
a genuine circle it's more like an oval

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,680
so um i'll have to uh i have to work on

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,399
that on future versions

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,680
so uh the ceta team uh which is our team

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,959
um

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,400
this is our mission our objectives and i

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,840
don't this is a lot of words but the

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
things i'd like you guys to focus on

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,760
here uh is that our mission is to inform

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,200
educate and advise hsbc and the broader

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
cyber security industries so you know we

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,200
like doing these sorts of engagements uh

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
so we can you know reach out and share

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,439
our insights and our findings and then

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,200
hopefully learn from from you all out

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,600
there as well

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
ideally what we're trying to do with

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
everything we do though is empower

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,799
decision makers globally

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,799
embolden our own defenses and the

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,520
defenses of others and then ideally and

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
ultimately weaken our adversaries and

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,759
the really the key to how we do this is

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,280
by leading in the cyber sharing

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
ecosystem

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
and so we do a lot of sharing uh we want

48
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,399
to share a lot more we're going to talk

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,240
about some of the stuff that we share

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,680
and we'd like to share more with with

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
anyone interested

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,079
beyond obviously the raw topic of this

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,960
talk

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
okay so with that um

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
we'd like to uh take a step back and

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,439
talk about cyber as an economic model

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,160
so to begin with let's talk about the

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,239
supply over to you karen

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,800
thanks j.r um so yeah let's talk a

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,599
little bit about supply in terms of um

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,560
data that's accessible um and and why

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,000
it's valuable so

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
in terms of data that um might be

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,920
interesting to a criminal group or

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,280
threat actor we have things like

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
intellectual properties schematics that

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,480
sort of thing

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,120
personal information like health records

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,840
um financial data so you know for us as

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,920
a bank credit card numbers or any other

71
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
kind of account information

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
um super duper secrets which could

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
uh be a lot of different things um

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,200
certainly like government data or

75
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,519
mergers and acquisitions kind of stuff

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
and there's all this really um valuable

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,599
and data data accessible

78
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,440
um on servers that are connected to the

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,599
internet 24 7 you know everything we're

80
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,040
doing we're putting in the cloud to make

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
it convenient to access um that also

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,159
makes it more accessible to criminals if

83
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,800
you click one more time jr

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,640
um a threat actor criminal group might

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
be interested in you know what's the

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,400
cheapest and most risk-averse way to

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
steal data that's their whole operating

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
model

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
so physical break-in is an option but

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,400
obviously there the cost is really high

91
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,920
in terms of actually conducting the

92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,239
break-in the risk of getting cots really

93
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,120
high

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,799
alternatively they could recruit an

95
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,319
insider

96
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,000
that potentially takes a long time so

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
it's very expensive and again um you

98
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,159
know the risk of getting caught there is

99
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,920
fairly high as well there's another

100
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,519
alternative

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,040
which is that they can hack in and take

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
it um and that's appealing for a number

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,879
of different reasons and i'll i'll pass

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
back to jr talk about that yeah and

105
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
obviously you know we're we're probably

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,799
preaching in the choir with all this but

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,519
the demand for that supply is super high

108
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,200
um the reason being that there's little

109
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
to no risk of attribution with a lot of

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
these things um even when they are

111
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
caught you can just say nah i didn't do

112
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
it uh and uh there's really it's really

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
hard to prove

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
um it's obviously extremely cheap to

115
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
conduct um you know anyone sitting in

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
their home with connect connected to the

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
internet could get involved in a

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,080
criminal activity like this

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,720
for governments and for uh

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
you know organizations that want to

121
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
engage in criminal activity like this

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
there are strategic intelligence

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,479
benefits and then obviously the big

124
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,000
thing is that there's been massive

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,479
financial benefits to this whole thing

126
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,680
um so

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,919
you know everyone's everyone i would

128
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,520
assume has been following ransomware i

129
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
even had my mom call them and talk to me

130
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,960
about the colonial pipeline uh so uh you

131
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
know ransomware obviously has been one

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
of the big stories for the year um and

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
it has been

134
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,240
driven by not just the the ability for

135
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
threat actors to get into networks but

136
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
actually the theft of that data that

137
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
they can use

138
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,280
to uh ransom back to organizations

139
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,680
and you know and obviously uh being

140
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
pumped up by uh the growth of

141
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,280
cryptocurrency over the last year and

142
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
this is just a fun fact which actually i

143
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
think is wrong because i i didn't google

144
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,840
it this morning but last night with uh

145
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,240
el salvador adopting bitcoin bitcoin

146
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
dropped by a whole lot so i think this

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,520
is actually 11.9 million but anyway i i

148
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,400
uh

149
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
was making other changes of these slides

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
just before we started so i'll just

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,039
leave it at that

152
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,919
okay

153
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,000
so typically the way we've always

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,199
defended

155
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,440
is by employing a defense and depth

156
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,560
model

157
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,039
and defense in depth uh as many people

158
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,800
are probably aware is just the idea

159
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
about building uh different layers

160
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,880
around

161
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
your your sensitive data

162
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,880
to identify and prevent and protect that

163
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,840
data

164
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
at large it is it is a crucial element a

165
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,680
crucial thing that all organizations

166
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
need to be doing it is costly though um

167
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
and i and i hopefully i put some zloty

168
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,120
in there too because uh

169
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,759
it costs lots of money in all currencies

170
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,880
here

171
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,759
um

172
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,759
but ideally though we hope that when

173
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,759
we're spending all this this time and

174
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,080
money uh implementing our defense and

175
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
depth uh we actually have a graph that

176
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,280
looks like this we want our investments

177
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
to constantly be increasing the

178
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,600
operational time and expense of our

179
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
threat actors you know as we spend more

180
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
money we want to make it harder for them

181
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
but in reality we end up getting curves

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
like this when we start spending money

183
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,000
um because oftentimes spending can have

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
a diminishing return uh especially when

185
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
you get vendors coming in here and

186
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,080
talking about quantum blockchain and

187
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,319
selling you their latest artificial

188
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,720
machine learning uh thing that frankly

189
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,840
uh

190
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
i mean no offense to the vendors a lot

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
of it is just straight snake oil

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,960
so

193
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
what we suggest uh as a way to start

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
flattening out this curve uh and we're

195
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
getting back to that original curve is

196
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,319
to start addressing the demand side of

197
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,520
cyber so the supply is again that data

198
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,319
thereafter the demand uh is what we want

199
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
to start addressing through the use of

200
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
cyber deception

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
so cyber deception itself uh the concept

202
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
is to let the threat actor in

203
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,599
uh give them fake data show them fake

204
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
users put honey tokens all over the

205
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
network

206
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,240
literally build a whole fake rich

207
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,199
environment uh to to deceive and to

208
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,880
learn about those threats we'll talk

209
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
about how we've implemented this in our

210
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
organization but

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
before we go there let me kick it back

212
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
to karen to talk about the whole

213
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
engagement continuum here

214
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,280
thanks jared so yeah we can view um

215
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,840
cyber deception and generally defensive

216
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,400
um activities on a spectrum from that

217
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,720
range from passive activities to more

218
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
active

219
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,160
um forms of defense so on the more

220
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,919
passive side we have things like logs a

221
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
very traditional sort of classic

222
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,039
monitoring and threat detection where

223
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,800
we're collecting data in our own

224
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
organization and looking through it to

225
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,599
make sure

226
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,879
we aren't detecting anything bad

227
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,000
happening

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,680
as we move towards the more active end

229
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,759
we have things like honey pots and which

230
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,120
many of you may be familiar with it's

231
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,199
just a system that's made vulnerable so

232
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,599
it looks attractive to a threat actor

233
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,120
and so these are more reactive

234
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,639
techniques we're waiting for the threat

235
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,160
actor to come along and do something

236
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,720
that we notice um and you know if we

237
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
don't notice it then we're in trouble

238
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
as we move towards the active

239
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
end of the spectrum

240
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
um we start to look at things like

241
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
adversary engagement

242
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,039
which is making an environment for the

243
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,479
threat actor

244
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,720
that looks appealing and inviting them

245
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
in enabling their access um jared you

246
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,879
want to talk about the last sort of

247
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,879
option on this slide yeah and the last

248
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,320
option we call radioactive because it is

249
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,958
not something that anyone outside of law

250
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,360
enforcement should be engaged in um

251
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
there have been obviously there's been

252
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
some laws globally that have discussed

253
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,640
hackback um they will always

254
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,959
fall afoul of the law though because uh

255
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,800
various countries will never

256
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
uh accept the fact that you you are

257
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,120
allowed to hack back and obviously you

258
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,880
know hacking back sometimes you're

259
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
hacking back through a victim

260
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
uh that has al has also been victimized

261
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,040
by that threat actor to get back to the

262
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,120
it's it's a mess it's a complicated mess

263
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,200
it's something that law enforcement and

264
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
government uh need to manage and you

265
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,800
know obviously if you're in a situation

266
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
where you want to hack back i suggest

267
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
you reach out to your local ideally

268
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,880
public federal law enforcement uh to

269
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,279
talk with them um about how

270
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,200
they can they can perhaps engage in

271
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
something like that

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
i think obviously clearly we are here at

273
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,200
the the most active end in which we uh

274
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,360
have deemed legal uh which is adversary

275
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
engagement

276
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,320
okay so

277
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,880
how did our program uh

278
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,360
get to uh the state in which we are able

279
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,519
to do adversary engagement

280
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
uh well one is uh a lot of 1980s

281
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
references and movie references

282
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,320
um we once had a group ask us why the

283
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,360
car didn't go to 100 miles per hour uh

284
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
and clearly they've never seen back to

285
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
the future so um check your flux

286
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,480
capacitor before asking that question

287
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
okay so for um for cyber deception here

288
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
i want to talk about the things that

289
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
we've gone through to get to get here so

290
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,399
these are the steps of cyber

291
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,160
intelligence maturity and then the

292
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,760
milestones and steps that we've gone

293
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
through to get to that ability to run

294
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,000
these types of operations

295
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
so our team

296
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,720
anna in its infancy uh we started doing

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
essentially ocean regurgitation we took

298
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,200
uh cyber stories that were in the news

299
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,399
and we wrote reports for our

300
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,800
organization and told our organization

301
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,160
uh what it means for our for the company

302
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
you know oftentimes you get a lot of

303
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
vendors and consultants who start coming

304
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,640
in and telling you hey actually intel is

305
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
about the dark web you should really be

306
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,680
focused on all of these silly forums uh

307
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
and a lot of unactionable data so you're

308
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,760
out in reality you're wasting money and

309
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,279
your maturity is actually decreasing at

310
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,399
this point

311
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,720
eventually you start realizing hey um

312
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
there's bad indicators of compromise i

313
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
could be using for our organizational

314
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
defense so you can find companies that

315
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,279
provide those things

316
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,920
and figure out how to use those in your

317
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,160
organization uh to defend against uh

318
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,839
that bad activity

319
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
then you realize hey wait a minute i can

320
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,480
actually find this stuff myself before

321
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,880
uh other vendors can so i'm gonna start

322
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
doing this myself

323
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,519
now i've moved to the stage where i've

324
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,920
built my own automated intel feed and i

325
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
no longer need these vendor feeds

326
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,000
because uh i'm confident in the work

327
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,920
that i'm doing the data that i'm

328
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,760
yielding back and the way that my

329
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
organization is using it in in its

330
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,160
defense

331
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
and then really the next big step to

332
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,000
maturity is being able to proactively

333
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
identify compromises and share

334
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
intelligence with others in the

335
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
community to hopefully prevent

336
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
additional damage and i put hopefully

337
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
because you know

338
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
not everyone obviously actions uh the

339
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,760
information they receive

340
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,200
so you know everyone's trying to do

341
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,880
their best effort in this space but

342
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,120
sharing intelligence uh is really

343
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,839
crucial as a sector uh and as a

344
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,240
community uh to to try to limit the

345
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,160
damage coming from threat actors and

346
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,959
then finally here we go this is uh being

347
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,360
able to do proactive uh ttp

348
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,800
identification

349
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,240
uh through adversary engagement

350
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
so uh let's talk about why we're doing

351
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,120
this and this is this is uh the pyramid

352
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,800
of pain it's one of those things that

353
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
several years ago was in all cyber

354
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
security presentations and we're uh

355
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
we're bringing it back so the pyramid of

356
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,519
taint of pain is about the types of

357
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,600
indicators you might use to detect an

358
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
adversary's activities

359
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
compared to the amount of pain it would

360
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,839
cause an adversary when you deny them

361
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,600
those indicators

362
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,639
right so

363
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,760
the idea is that uh if you identify an

364
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
ip address and you block it it's easy

365
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
for a threat actor to just change the ip

366
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,480
address but if you are actually able to

367
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
map out their ttps it's very tough for

368
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,360
them to change their actual behavior so

369
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,839
how do we actually ascend this and and

370
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,920
and well one is through amazing

371
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
animations

372
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,000
uh like this boom and yeah so obviously

373
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,399
for us uh we found the key to this stage

374
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,680
is adversary engagement

375
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,959
and now

376
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,040
on for the main show uh adversary

377
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,600
engagement in action karen

378
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,480
thanks

379
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,920
um so we're going to sort of walk

380
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,680
through an adversary engagement

381
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,360
operation that we ran a couple of months

382
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
ago in some detail and sort of explain

383
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,160
how it works um what we got out of it

384
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
and what the value is and all that good

385
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,160
stuff we're going to start by looking at

386
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,639
an example of a full ransomware attack

387
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,360
chain just to sort of level set um so

388
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,959
this is an example of a ryuk attack

389
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,600
chain from i believe probably early this

390
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,519
year um

391
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,199
you can see that the initial axis vector

392
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,760
was a phishing email and that's followed

393
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
by a number of different techniques that

394
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
are used for things like lateral

395
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
movement

396
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,360
credential access and eventually impact

397
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
which is the deployment of the

398
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,040
ransomware if you click a couple times

399
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,000
jr

400
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,120
um

401
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,040
we receive phishing emails like this

402
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
trickbot emmette all of your sort of

403
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,560
standard commodity stuff that can lead

404
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,399
to ransomware um at hsbc um but

405
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,000
typically they're blocked by our email

406
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,199
gateway if you click yep so that's good

407
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,240
news um you know our defenses are robust

408
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,680
and effective they're working at the

409
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,240
point where we want them to work um the

410
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,399
downside of this is that we lose

411
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800
visibility of those later stages in the

412
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,600
attack chain um and so without that

413
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,240
visibility we're dependent on reports

414
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,440
from vendors and other organizations who

415
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
have been impacted to tell us about

416
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,880
those later stage techniques that are

417
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,279
used before we can defend against them

418
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
obviously i should go without saying we

419
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,160
don't want to observe a full ransomware

420
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
attack at our organization

421
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,120
[Music]

422
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,079
at hsbc what we want to do is observe an

423
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,880
attack by engaging with the adversary

424
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,600
in our own environment and that we are

425
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,399
watching so how do we do that

426
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
we start by setting up a fake company

427
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
that will act as a victim and we're very

428
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
careful here to avoid any attribution to

429
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,360
hsbc or any other organization this is

430
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,199
completely fake fictional company that

431
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,160
we come up with

432
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,560
we then curate a realistic looking

433
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,199
environment so we make a network and

434
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,880
populate it with artifacts that make it

435
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,320
look genuine to the thread actor and

436
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
we'll talk a bit more about how we do

437
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,240
that and what that looks like

438
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
we then detonate malware inside of the

439
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,399
environment and that intentionally gives

440
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,560
the threat actor access to that

441
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,199
environment um and then we monitor their

442
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,920
behavior as they sort of go through an

443
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,680
attack chain and collect all those

444
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,120
different techniques that they're using

445
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,600
okay so diving in a bit deeper what does

446
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,199
this environment actually look like so

447
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,120
as i said we start by creating a fake

448
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,959
company with a small network

449
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,160
and that basically is an active

450
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
directory server with a small number of

451
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,480
users and computers associated with it

452
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
so there's not a lot here

453
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
but it's enough to make it look

454
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,839
realistic to the thread actors so that

455
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,360
they can start to explore a bit more and

456
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,920
get a bit interested and just jumping in

457
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,000
on that point for a second because um

458
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
we did this uh we've gone through

459
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,800
various experiments on this and without

460
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,120
active directory uh we actually found

461
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
that thread actors often would give up

462
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
uh fairly quickly and just assume that

463
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,480
it's fake um and so uh you know for us

464
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,639
we found having active directory running

465
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,639
uh was was kind of crucial to make sure

466
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,480
that the deception lasted longer

467
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,160
yeah thanks chair

468
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
um

469
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,759
the next part of this is we have a

470
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,279
gateway

471
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,480
machine that basically keeps this

472
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
network isolated obviously we're going

473
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
to be running malware in this

474
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,160
environment um so we want to make sure

475
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,759
that it's protected from anything else

476
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,920
that's out there and we also use this

477
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
point this gateway point to collect data

478
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
so we're pulling off the network traffic

479
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
logs all of that stuff

480
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,639
and that data is then piped into our

481
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,040
analysis environment so this is where we

482
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,440
look through all that network traffic

483
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,599
analyze it automatically to pull out

484
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,280
techniques and and watch what the threat

485
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,839
actor is doing

486
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,799
we then detonate malware on a victim

487
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
machine that's in this network and so

488
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,319
that effectively gives the threat actor

489
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,160
access to this network where we can

490
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,919
watch them

491
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,520
and then finally the threat actor

492
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,000
controls that malware from a command and

493
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,439
control server that's hosted on the

494
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,119
internet and the attack will sort of

495
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,000
proceed as they um you know send further

496
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,240
tools down from that server and continue

497
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,799
with the attack

498
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,760
um so quick acknowledgement here a lot

499
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,919
of this work we've done in partnership

500
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,559
um with the mitre corporation

501
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,000
and specifically their engaged team

502
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,720
which is led by dr sandbarr you may be

503
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,120
familiar with the name mitre

504
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,600
if you've used mitre attack or the cbe

505
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,840
vulnerability list before

506
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
so this is another area that they

507
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,480
specialize in

508
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,720
and offer a lot of expertise

509
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
in this deception adversary engagement

510
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,320
area

511
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,720
um not to be confused with the miter

512
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,360
that makes soccer era footballs um or

513
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,679
miter saws this is a separate miter

514
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,320
yeah and just a bit more on engage and

515
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
gage has actually uh just been rolled

516
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,280
out um by mitre within the last month

517
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,880
um and it's their framework for

518
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
discussing and planning adversary

519
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,039
engagement deception uh and denial

520
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
operations uh so not to read from the

521
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
slide there but that's exactly what it

522
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,360
is

523
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,799
um check out engage engage.minor.org

524
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,280
uh you know or email the engaged team i

525
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,039
mean we work with them really closely on

526
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,520
a lot of what we do and we we uh talk

527
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
about all the operations we're running

528
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,600
with them uh to get more ideas and and

529
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,080
they they bounce ideas off us as well so

530
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
it's been a really great partnership and

531
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,840
um it's one that they're looking to grow

532
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,039
as well as us

533
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,760
uh because this this world becomes

534
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,440
better as we get more of us working

535
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,880
together on this stuff and we'll talk a

536
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,080
bit more about that in a little bit

537
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,400
awesome so going back to sort of this

538
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
operation um that we're going to talk

539
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,880
about in in more detail one of the early

540
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
steps that we need is to select malware

541
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
that we actually want to run

542
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
so like a lot of organizations we're

543
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,000
particularly interested in ransomware

544
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,520
because it's such a huge threat right

545
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,320
now

546
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,400
so we started looking at

547
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,880
initial access malwares

548
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,919
that tend to lead to ransomware so

549
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,760
particularly looking at ryuk

550
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,679
we discovered that basil loader is one

551
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
that's commonly used

552
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,440
in attack chains that lead to ryu

553
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,400
gransomware and we also discovered that

554
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,240
we'd received some

555
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,919
basil loader samples if you click a

556
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,280
couple more times

557
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,880
um

558
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
on our email gateway um that we're

559
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,200
blocked which is great um but you know

560
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,480
that's interesting because we've been

561
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
targeted by this and so we want to learn

562
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
more

563
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,360
how this attack chain would proceed if

564
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
our email gateway failed for whatever

565
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,320
reason

566
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
yeah and for the record obviously you

567
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,080
guys can see this is this is now a

568
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
several months old um

569
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,320
example and we've run many operations

570
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,480
since then but uh we have some good

571
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,000
slides for this one so that's why we're

572
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,480
going with it

573
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,440
um

574
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,679
so yeah so for the next few slides we're

575
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,280
going to have this timeline at the top

576
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,039
of the slide here and that's sort of

577
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,200
tracking where we are chronologically in

578
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,440
this operation but um starting on a

579
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,240
monday evening uh several months ago

580
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,159
um if you click a couple more times yeah

581
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,480
we detected an active sample of basil

582
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,799
loader um so this initial access malware

583
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,280
that tends to lead to ryu ransomware as

584
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,679
among other things um as just part of

585
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,520
our usual hunting activity and sort of

586
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,679
identified it as a good candidate to run

587
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,000
in this deception environment to engage

588
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
the adversary

589
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,480
so we log into gng consulting which is

590
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,960
the name of our fake company

591
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
we log into the network as one of one of

592
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
a fake uh one of our fake users um whose

593
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,720
name is addie patel again completely

594
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
fictional um and what we're gonna do is

595
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,480
run that that sample as this user and so

596
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,880
the threat actor if you go back sorry

597
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,240
um

598
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,080
to the threat actor it will look as

599
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,320
though addie's received a phishing email

600
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,559
and he's just downloaded this attachment

601
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,240
and tried to run it um and so that's

602
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,159
what we do we double click on it and the

603
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,880
operation begins

604
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,080
and about four hours in and

605
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,159
that first stage sample baseloader

606
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,880
downloaded and executed the second stage

607
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,280
which is called bazabakdoor

608
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,600
and and we start to see a lot of data

609
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,720
coming through

610
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,480
network traffic and logs and all that

611
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,720
good stuff and so to process that we

612
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,520
used uh and we still use elasticsearch

613
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
and cabana which many of you may have

614
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
heard of they're very popular data

615
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,880
analysis frameworks um and we use those

616
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,960
to to analyze the data in real time we

617
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
can build queries and visualizations to

618
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,400
start to understand

619
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
um

620
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,039
our new techniques being used by the

621
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,159
threat actor we can extract iocs as

622
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,919
they're being dropped

623
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,600
and detect anomalies in the traffic so

624
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,720
we can detect any changes in behavior

625
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,080
and actually i just realized we sort of

626
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,919
overlooked the fact that we have a whole

627
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,520
alerting environment that takes place

628
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,919
with with these operations that

629
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,440
you can use through various messenger

630
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,840
apps so we're using slack uh to alert us

631
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,280
when different activities taking place

632
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,320
so that way um you know our team when an

633
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
operation is running we can actually

634
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,919
keep an eye on it uh 24 7 and we kind of

635
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,159
spread uh the responsibilities of

636
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,159
watching an operation across our

637
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,919
different locations and where we have

638
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,280
our personnel

639
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,880
so they can just keep an eye on slack

640
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,400
and then you know see when activities

641
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
happening and then you know respond to

642
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,480
it if there's something to respond to

643
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,000
yeah that's a good point this is the

644
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,200
sort of thing that we're watching all

645
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,799
the time we don't just let

646
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,120
malware run and and then you know ignore

647
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,400
it um

648
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
part of this is analyzing that data

649
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,159
automatically but also having someone

650
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,480
look at it and one thing that we noticed

651
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,640
um is that back bazzabak door that

652
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,400
second stage malware didn't actually do

653
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
anything for over 36 hours

654
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,600
which might seem surprising um but it's

655
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,960
actually pretty common technique that

656
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,480
threat actors use it's really hard to

657
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,960
get detected if you don't do anything

658
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,480
and so it tends to be an effective

659
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
technique so at that point

660
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,760
the threat actor began to conduct some

661
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,799
reconnaissance so we start to see some

662
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,840
commands and scripts being run

663
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
to look for things like active directory

664
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
metadata

665
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,400
what av we're running public facing ip

666
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,880
time zone language settings um some

667
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,559
specifications about the machine it was

668
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,520
on

669
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,840
um and like a list of disk drives and

670
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,440
what processes we're running and this is

671
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,400
all sort of to try and understand um

672
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,039
identify what organization this is and

673
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,799
you know so is it worth looking at

674
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,760
further

675
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,799
um

676
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,559
does it look real

677
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,440
you know

678
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
and they do that by looking at

679
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,840
things like cpu disk space memory as

680
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,760
well as public-facing ip and active

681
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,440
directory if it has all that stuff and

682
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
it looks interesting um the threat actor

683
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,880
may continue down the chain um to

684
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,919
towards impact so if you click

685
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,760
about three hours after that initial

686
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,919
reconnaissance and we start to see some

687
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,919
interesting things happening so

688
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,799
um we see a file that gets dropped um in

689
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,760
the user's temp folder this uh temp.exe

690
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,279
file

691
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,080
if you click a couple times oh yeah um

692
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,240
and we also start to see some traffic to

693
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,679
a new domain this shopazer.com

694
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,440
we discover that that new file that was

695
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,600
created is actually a sample of cobalt

696
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,120
strike beacon

697
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,440
that's using shop azer.com as its

698
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,279
command and control server

699
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,240
um we as part of our sort of automated

700
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,039
hunting um and intelligent intelligence

701
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,279
gathering we track cobalt strike really

702
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,320
closely

703
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
um so we actually found that we had

704
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,679
detected cobalt strike

705
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,320
if you click yeah awesome um about two

706
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,240
weeks before this operation

707
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,600
so that's interesting for a number of

708
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,679
reasons first of all we also you know

709
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,240
shared that info when we discovered it

710
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,159
um through miss with some trusted

711
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,600
partners and if you're interested in

712
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,919
that sharing activity um we'll have a

713
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
contact email at the end if you you know

714
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,679
are interested in and becoming part of

715
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,679
that uh sharing community

716
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,919
um we actually put our impact email in

717
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,520
the upper right on every slide too oh

718
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,799
yeah yeah so that that email c hsbc.com

719
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,799
um the other interesting thing about

720
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,400
this is it's sort of an intelligence

721
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,799
point in itself um yeah we discovered

722
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,120
this cobalt strike server being set up

723
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,520
two weeks before it was actively used in

724
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,240
a uh in an attack chain so that tells us

725
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,440
something about

726
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,600
how long you see two servers are active

727
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,840
before they're used or how long they're

728
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,240
used um in their lifetime which is

729
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,600
helpful

730
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,200
yeah and if anyone is uh like a super

731
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,600
confidence follower of all talks two

732
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,000
years ago we actually spoke about how we

733
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
do a lot of this hunting for all this

734
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,880
infrastructure

735
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,159
um and that work has grown uh

736
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,720
exponentially since that time um but we

737
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
do have and now i think um at the time

738
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,080
we were talking about trying to get the

739
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,000
ability to share that information in a

740
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,080
more uh automated way with with the

741
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,640
community and that's now in place and we

742
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
um share this speed

743
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,039
uh for free obviously uh with uh

744
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,120
hundreds of organizations so if you're

745
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,559
interested in this

746
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,200
um reach out to us i mean the the key

747
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
with with all the data that we're

748
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,799
collecting and sharing is that it's just

749
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,559
not made public

750
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,600
and then ideally you know if you uh find

751
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,039
something interesting you can talk to us

752
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,799
about it because you know sharing is

753
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,200
caring uh and we want to build better

754
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,480
relationships with everyone out there

755
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,080
okay back to you karen

756
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,400
awesome um so just a little

757
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,640
while after we saw that sample drop to

758
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,559
that cobalt strike sample

759
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,400
um we start to see some more stuff

760
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,640
happening um so

761
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,760
cobalt strike used a tool called 85 to

762
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,600
do some more detailed reconnaissance on

763
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,679
our active directory setup

764
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,840
they also use some powershell scripts to

765
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,039
enumerate the file shares um so this is

766
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,799
the kind of reconnaissance that we would

767
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,200
see typically preceding lateral movement

768
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
so you can see some of the adfined

769
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,799
queries there they're trying to

770
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,480
understand what the network looks like

771
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,320
and where the valuable assets that they

772
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,400
need to go after in order to

773
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,200
either steal data or drop ransomware

774
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,000
whatever it may be

775
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,120
and yeah you can see here some um

776
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,320
examples of where they tried to

777
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,679
enumerate the file shares we didn't

778
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,440
actually have any on this environment at

779
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
the time but this is the kind of thing

780
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,640
again that we would typically see

781
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,840
um if the thread actor was looking for

782
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,600
you know data to encrypt file shares

783
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
would be a place to look as well as just

784
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,039
data to steal

785
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,679
and ransom

786
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,000
so just minutes later we got some note

787
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,159
or alerts from microsoft defender which

788
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,760
was the antivirus we were running in

789
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,320
this environment um that it had detected

790
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,640
this reconnaissance behavior um that we

791
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
just talked about as being related to

792
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,600
ryuk ransomware um which is really

793
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,399
interesting um

794
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,360
from there a defender detected and

795
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
stopped all the running samples of

796
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,919
cobalt strike um which effectively

797
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,159
stopped this operation but

798
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,399
um it was interesting to see

799
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,200
um that this activity was identified as

800
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,559
being related to rio grande somewhere

801
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,399
since initially we sort of picked basil

802
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,880
loader our initial access malware

803
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,559
because we thought it might lead to ryuk

804
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,720
ransomware so um that was a really

805
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,960
interesting point um and why this is the

806
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
end of this operation

807
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,320
um there's a few things that we should

808
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,600
consider here

809
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,640
um

810
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,720
just because microsoft defender stopped

811
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
cobalt strike doesn't necessarily mean

812
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,159
that this is over

813
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,799
um the earlier stage malware that we we

814
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,240
started we kicked this whole thing off

815
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
with um was still on the system so

816
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,320
microsoft defender didn't catch that in

817
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,720
fact bazzabak door was still running

818
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,600
when cobalt strike was halted and and

819
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,640
removed so effectively that means that

820
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,760
the threat actor

821
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
you know can still get back in through

822
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,440
bazzabak door and drop a different tool

823
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,720
drop cobalt strike again and this is why

824
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,640
threat actors conduct operations in

825
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,480
stages like this why they use multiple

826
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,240
tools because it offers them a level of

827
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,679
flexibility

828
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,440
and allows them to keep coming back when

829
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,799
something doesn't work which is often

830
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,240
the case

831
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,960
and the point here basically is that

832
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,840
when a threat actor gets a foothold into

833
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
an organization particularly one that is

834
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,480
valuable

835
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,880
they're not going to stop trying

836
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,720
different tools or different techniques

837
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,880
until they're completely their access is

838
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,520
completely revoked and that means every

839
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
single tool across the attack chain has

840
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,000
been removed and all access has been has

841
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,960
been revoked

842
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,159
so

843
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,960
how did this help hsbc why did we do

844
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
this um

845
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,279
well first of all and we were able

846
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,039
through this activity to identify a

847
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,600
number of iocs that we we hadn't known

848
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,880
about um so there were a number of tools

849
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,559
network um artifacts that we found um

850
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,039
that we immediately sent into our own

851
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,559
monitoring

852
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,399
capabilities so that we could track

853
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,240
those we also share those by a missed

854
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,919
with other organizations that we work

855
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,080
with

856
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,760
we also were able to collect more tcps

857
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,640
so

858
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,720
the fact that they use adfine to do

859
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,960
reconnaissance on active directory

860
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,600
um the powershell scripts that they use

861
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
to look at file shares these are all

862
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,799
things that we collect and send to our

863
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,000
monitoring team so they can start to

864
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,840
come up with rules about how to detect

865
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,200
that behavior

866
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
as it happens in our network

867
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,279
and just a little extra on that because

868
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,360
we so we have an internal threat hunting

869
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,159
team

870
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,960
um and we so every at the end of every

871
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,440
operation um we

872
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,679
uh talk to our threat hunting team as

873
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,520
well as our red team

874
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
about exactly how these operations took

875
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,320
place

876
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,159
to walk them through these ttps because

877
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,320
they're the ones that are trying to one

878
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,760
the red team's trying to mimic this

879
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,000
exact same behavior and the threat

880
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,840
hunting team are trying to build these

881
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,399
use cases to identify and detect the

882
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,320
actual behaviors inside our network as

883
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,039
well so uh that that collaboration

884
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,039
internally on this type of work is super

885
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,880
important for us and really anyone

886
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,159
engaging in this

887
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,799
uh to ensure that you're you're making

888
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,080
sure that the right parts of your

889
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,279
organization are receiving this

890
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,679
information

891
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,039
yeah

892
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,440
um so through this activity and and uh

893
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,960
sort of um working with the threat

894
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,799
hunting teams the way i just described

895
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,399
that makes it more painful for this

896
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,399
adversary now to operate in our

897
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,799
environment even if they change um the

898
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,279
tools you know that they're using and in

899
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,080
terms of hashes ips domains

900
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,919
even if that stuff changes they'd have

901
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,519
to completely change the way they do

902
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,519
reconnaissance and that pre-lateral

903
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,360
movement activity in order to get past

904
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
our defenses

905
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,480
which is expensive

906
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,840
yeah

907
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,039
yeah and furthermore i mean

908
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,880
most people just can't do it changing

909
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,039
your behavior is extremely hard that's

910
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,519
that's why it's tough at the very top um

911
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,360
more realistically once you're able to

912
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,720
detect someone's behavior the threat

913
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,399
actor will actually just move on to an

914
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,039
easier target

915
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,240
so future work in this area there's a

916
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,679
lot that we're doing sort of in this

917
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,919
space at the moment um one of the things

918
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,080
that we want to do is automated sharing

919
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,600
of those techniques

920
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,519
um through miss um but also

921
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,519
through other means as well

922
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,519
being able to extract those so we can

923
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,200
reduce the amount of time that it takes

924
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,080
to

925
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,320
run malware identify ttps and then

926
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,840
implement defenses

927
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
the further that we can automate that

928
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,440
and the more difficult it's going to

929
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,679
make you

930
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,279
conducting these operations for threat

931
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,880
actors is going to become

932
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,760
just too costly

933
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,519
so

934
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,799
you know what's the what's the ultimate

935
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,640
goal of this whole thing

936
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,159
ideally we're trying to work towards

937
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,399
changing our adversaries behavior

938
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,200
so if we go back to

939
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,679
to our uh skeletor here asking what's

940
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,840
the cheapest and most risk adverse way

941
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,279
to steal data

942
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,080
uh

943
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,919
what we want him to think

944
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,279
in the end after going through all these

945
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,679
these fake uh deception operations is

946
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,000
man i am wasting time to decipher back

947
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,440
from fiction

948
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,919
uh the more that i hack

949
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,760
it seems like i'm the more i'm making it

950
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,000
easier for uh everyone to detect and

951
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,600
stop me right so that's because

952
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,080
everyone's starting to map out the ttps

953
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,720
and the behaviors of these bad guys

954
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,679
um

955
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,399
every time he thinks he gets uh you know

956
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,000
schematics and he gives them to his boss

957
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,519
and he finds out they're fake he's you

958
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,799
know these guys are starting to look

959
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,080
like fools so uh

960
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,919
you know it can become incredibly

961
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,000
frustrating for these guys the more they

962
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
they start operating against fake

963
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,880
environments

964
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,919
and so

965
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,159
the utopia version though is that we get

966
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,399
threat actors to say man these cyber

967
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,559
attacks are no longer effective

968
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,000
uh you know

969
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,039
i mean

970
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,720
people have doritos worldwide for the

971
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,039
most part so hopefully oh you know i i

972
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,559
would not want to take doritos away from

973
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,720
anyone even bad guys so uh so hopefully

974
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,559
he still has his doritos

975
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,040
um but yeah i mean there's our war games

976
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,879
reference there is really the only what

977
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,119
we want front actors to ultimately

978
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,800
believe is that the only winning move is

979
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,320
just not to play in the first place

980
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,280
so on the topic of uh partnerships um we

981
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
we're working already with a couple

982
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,000
other organizations to run operations um

983
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,079
and we really like to grow

984
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,239
uh the number of companies that are

985
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,359
willing to

986
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,679
engage with us on this stuff and some of

987
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,199
the exciting things that we've been able

988
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,040
to do with with some other organizations

989
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280
is basically pick malware that we're

990
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,800
both interested in

991
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,760
and simultaneously uh detonate that

992
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,960
malware and then talk about why uh we

993
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,520
why one of us saw a specific behavior in

994
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,879
our environment versus another

995
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,440
environment um because everyone there's

996
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,719
no one is going to design their own

997
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,560
deception environment in an identical

998
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
fashion i mean i suppose you could you

999
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,960
could exactly copy uh what we're doing

1000
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,760
but

1001
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,359
everyone's got their own ideas and their

1002
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,280
own take on how to do this

1003
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,800
and i think we can all learn from each

1004
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,640
other when we're able to do these

1005
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,440
simultaneous uh cross-sector deception

1006
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,880
operations

1007

about 10 years ago

1013
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,520
it's a bit of an academic book but you

1014
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,440

1015

1023
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,560
about um

1024
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
you know what what what you'd like to do

1025
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,400
and how you'd like to get involved and

1026
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,680
um you know there are some some pitfalls

1027
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,440
uh and dangers that you need to be aware

1028
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,640
of and some of this stuff that we'll

1029
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,800
talk to anyone about anyone that would

1030
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,720
like to hear more about it because

1031
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,320
i think one of the the reason i wanted

1032
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,000
to highlight the fact that we have this

1033
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,079
monitoring that takes place

1034
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,680
24x7 is that uh we we are very careful

1035
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,440
to make sure that we don't

1036
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,240
uh

1037
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,320
get placed inside a botnet that's that's

1038
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,640
going after others so um you know

1039
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,000
there's a lot of different ways that you

1040
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,720
can um prevent that kind of activity one

1041
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,800
by monitoring two by doing specific

1042
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,200
types of throttling uh three by white

1043
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,839
listing uh bad activity and so you're

1044
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,520
you're like basically keeping an eye on

1045
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,960
the bad activity and allowing it to

1046
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,079
continue

1047
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,440
so there's a number of techniques that

1048
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,520
we've employed um in order to ensure

1049
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,240
these operations are successful and safe

1050
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,880
uh to conduct in the first place uh

1051
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,079
karen is there anything i'm missing on

1052
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,680
on any of that

1053
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,079
no i think that that basically covers it

1054
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,280
okay

1055
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,000
well then uh we are now at our uh

1056
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,240
obligatory last slide and it's not

1057
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,400
obligatory because this is hsbc is an

1058
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,560
awesome place to work obviously we work

1059
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,320
here so it's more awesome because of

1060
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,200
that

1061
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,119
uh but we do have a whole uh

1062
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,359
range of jobs um open

1063
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,280
um and so uh

1064
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,440
there is a website that i'm not gonna

1065
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,720
try to pronounce

1066
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,119
uh that has all of the open roles listed

1067
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,680
p-r-a-c-u-j.p.l

1068
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,560

1073

have been an in-person conference uh we

1074
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,119
would have all been there with you and

1075
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,480
patricia probably could have said a few

1076
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,960

1077

1080
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,720

1084
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,640
um you know we've been with hsbc a few

1085
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,599
years now uh and uh we're still here

1086
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,960
because we're still really enjoying what

1087
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,880
we're doing here and and what the

1088
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,800
organization offers

1089
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,400
okay

with that we're on to our final slide

1091
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,640
which i think means uh some sort of

1092
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,240
fancy animation takes place and then

1093
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,200
you're going to see our faces again

1094
