when i need to request something in the

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
supermarket but anyway so let me

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,760
introduce myself i'm philippe pierce

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,880
i've been working at a principal

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,439
security engineer at stock desk now it's

18
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,280
um a company from portugal and

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,880
this company is responsible to provide

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,439
some contact center as a service

21
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,560
and uh

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,439
and i am security research at san seguro

23
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,360
it's a brazilian company but they have

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,400
many customers around the world and they

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
were they they are were responsible it's

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
possible to provide some um

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,759
pen solutions a privilege access

28
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
management but

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,280
my job there is to work exclusively with

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,320
uh our research right and i'm security

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,560
uh advocate from this awesome project

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
called hack is not a crime

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
by the way i have heard some information

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,200
about that so the idea in this project

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,119
is to explain more about the hacking

36
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
concept right because for our

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
perspective hacker it's really not a

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,439
crime for example if you are if you

39
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,880
think about the lawyer for example

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,840
lawyer

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
it's a criminal lawyer or not criminal

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
lawyer of course they can you know works

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,160
with a criminal guy but no and not this

44
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,878
way

45
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,680
right so it's a it's a lawyer not a

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
criminal lawyer or a bad guy or a good

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
guy right in the hacking it's a concept

48
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,040
it's a mindset when you see some

49
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,520
applications or you know hardware or

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
another thing and you can use your

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,280
creative mind that's the idea of this

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,000
project and i'm a contributor of the

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
red team village it's a

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,959
community very uh bigger at the u.s

55
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,519
and uh i'm a very active participate

56
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,920
there and you know a speaker

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,080
and and so on and so on

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,200
and i'm part of the coordinate

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,879
coordinating of the defcon groups here

60
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,720
in sao paulo i'm talking from brazil now

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,640
here in my small office here in my

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,360
balcony as you can see and because it's

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
important right and here with this is my

64
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
website if you would like to see some

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,200
informations right uh about me if you

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,080
don't

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
if you don't like to see no words about

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,400
that uh i want you to be afraid right so

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,239
here we can find some presentations

70
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,959
about me some conference right and in

71
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,280
portuguese and spanish in in uh in

72
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,760
english of course and some articles that

73
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,400
have been published right and okay so

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,879
let me explain more about our topic

75
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,800
today so first of all i'd like to

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
explain more about this um

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,280
this idea about the developer software

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,920
the secure development software right

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,519
because um the point here is

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,840
all those threads is related with some

81
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,760
software right so of course we have

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
some

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,159
personal uh exploitation for example

84
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,640
when you need to go to the company in

85
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,360
person and you you try to explore or

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,959
using some you know

87
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,799
uh social engineering with just to

88
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,239
explore uh some guys in in a person but

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,360
the idea

90
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
usually when you talk about the threat

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
is related to a software attacks or you

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
know intellectual property death or

93
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,239
something related to this right and uh

94
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,760
today we're going to talk about this

95
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,560
talk

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,120
first of all uh about their seconds open

97
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,599
source 2 maintaining from the supernovae

98
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,200
it's my previous company by the way but

99
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,599
this is something open source

100
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,400
product

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
but the point is first of all we need to

102
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,478
understand about this different concept

103
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,478
right um

104
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,120
about the what is exactly the difference

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440
i'm going to the documentations here and

106
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
i'm clicking here in closeri just to

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
explain more about this some concepts

108
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
important thing to just to clarify to

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,120
all the

110
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,919
uh the obtaining right so first of all

111
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,680
what is sust is a statistical

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
application security test right so when

113
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,919
you run someone you perform some

114
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,440
analysis in your code before to publish

115
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
this code right so when you're

116
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,440
developing this code when you are in the

117
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
cycle the life cycle of the development

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
you need to uh to you need to have some

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
solutions related to the sas or sca

120
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
or something related to this right in

121
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,520
the other hand you have the dust and

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
dynamic application security test when

123
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
you publish this application then you

124
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
have some url and you can as they

125
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,600
perform this scanning this url to

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,560
understand

127
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,759
this code

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,520
already published of course is

129
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
vulnerable or not right and you and you

130
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
have eos it's another

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,080
kind of you know analysis when you talk

132
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,759
about the software is interactive

133
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,400
application security testing when you

134
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
combine these two statistics right so

135
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,759
what should be the best philip

136
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,759
it depends right so my recommendations

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,160
for you is to lose both of them right

138
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,880
you need to understand about your

139
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,759
sdlc your software development life

140
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,039
cycle it's pretty important to

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,520
understand that because when you see all

142
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,759
those steps when you have the

143
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,520
the developer environment you have the

144
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,759
qa the quality security steps for

145
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,600
example and you have the productions you

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,360
need to understand the

147
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
software development life cycle and you

148
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,720
know

149
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440
where exactly the place when you put the

150
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,759
uh exactly solution you can apply right

151
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,520
so here there's some concepts another

152
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
point here about the concept is about

153
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,680
the vulnerabilities how they are sec

154
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,960
works right and they works with the six

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
types of the security branch the first

156
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,600
is a critical as you can imagine right

157
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,639
so high medium low info it's it means

158
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,880
just on informations and i know because

159
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,080
probably the

160
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,280
the engine

161
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,560
don't know exactly what is the results

162
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
um it's other information important it's

163
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,720
about the false positive because

164
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,800
you know uh some cases the vulnerability

165
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,199
is a false positive but

166
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,479
you need to understand about your

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,360
environment to be clear if this

168
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
code is

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,039
false positive or not right and another

170
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,000
hand you have here they accept risk when

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,880
you know about the code and you can you

172
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,479
can decide if this risk is accepted or

173
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,199
not okay just to clarify the concept and

174
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,919
let's see how this works exactly these

175
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,080
tools first of all clicking cli and

176
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
overview

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
just to explain more about the oh of

178
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
course then i did i need to explain

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,919
about what is exactly or sec right so

180
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,680
here this explanation is open source

181
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
framework the idea is to identify to be

182
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
an identification and a vulnerabilities

183
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
the idea here is it's it's from a

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
perspective it's pretty cool because you

185
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,440
can work with a language different

186
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,680
language and the tools

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
because some when you look into their

188
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,759
aspect for example in the sas

189
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,160
tools uh about the wasp and by the way

190
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,400
orozek is there um

191
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,160
you have some limitations about the

192
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,919
programming language for example some

193
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,479
tools works with a c chart another's

194
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,400
about a java another kotlin uh item but

195
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,479
when he if it's possible you put all

196
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,360
those

197
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,000
tools in the same or all those problem

198
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,160
languages in the same tools it should be

199
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,479
nice right and here as you can see you

200
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,720
have a c-sharp java calling kotlin

201
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,440
python cooling terraform and you have by

202
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
the way here the kubernetes and it's a

203
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
you know it's a it's a tool that you can

204
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
use it's pretty cool and

205
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,960
that's how you that that you can work

206
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,319
with uh um

207
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,879
auto set right it's a pretty simple that

208
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,639
performance statistical analysis to

209
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,199
identify security flows right and let me

210
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,199
return here to the code documentations

211
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,759
and one important informations it's in

212
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,199
the end of this document this

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,280
documentation and by the way it's pretty

214
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,520
pretty nice right and you can use indian

215
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,400
locally as i will be running now here in

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,960
a cli and you can use it in a cgca cicd

217
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,080
pipeline

218
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
i mean you can put in this auto stack in

219
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,559
your pipeline and you can use it in the

220
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,120
id extensions right so if you are a

221
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,360
developer or if you know your developers

222
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,479
team you can apply this in your

223
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,279
developer environment okay and let's see

224
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,920
here another point and i think it's okay

225
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,959
so let's go to the cli let me click in

226
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,000
in a

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,399
installation process it's pretty simple

228
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,800
i'll be using locally now here i will

229
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,920
copy here

230
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,120
my

231
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
in my virtual machine i will copy this

232
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
let's check if my user has a permission

233
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,399
and although they don't have permission

234
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,360
right so

235
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
they need to have the good privilege

236
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,279
okay so it's pretty simple this is a

237
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,920
good the curl to request the binary and

238
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,240
after that i stall and as you can see

239
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,880
then move it to the bind and so the

240
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,480
local beam is slash use or sec why

241
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,040
because now i can set here the rsac and

242
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,800
i can set the hash h to see let's check

243
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
if you can see here okay it's good i'm

244
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,800
seeing here another monitor and the

245
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,680
presentation is good to see okay so here

246
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,160
you can use in the cli you can see

247
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,920
how can you use this you can accept the

248
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,000
flags or comment right so here you can

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,399
see the comments and the flags below

250
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,399
it's pretty simple to use we can use in

251
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,640
they start to what to start they are

252
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,279
sexy ally or if you if you'd like to see

253
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,880
the version or generate some

254
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,480
configurations

255
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,640
both in in our presentation just to

256
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,120
using they start okay so let's check for

257
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,600
sex start

258
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,399
year

259
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,760
or sex start and after that because of

260
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,040
you started our second click and the h

261
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,560
h again to see what to see the

262
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,079
flags or parameters parameters you can

263
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,320
what you prefer to set right so here as

264
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
you can see dash a it's authorization

265
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
string and it means the authorization

266
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,560
token for or the for the rsac api if

267
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,079
you'd like to send all those

268
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,839
vulnerabilities and this code for

269
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,160
example for some manager or and not

270
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
submarine for the auto second manager

271
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
okay and you can check here others of

272
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,720
course you have more than one and maybe

273
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,760
if you are think about for example

274
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,800
um about the sonar cube it's a pretty

275
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,680
nice uh tools and no

276
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,440
um as a tool like a um code quality

277
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,800
right and uh my point here is the order

278
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
of sonar key

279
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,120
was created with the focus in the code

280
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
quality right but they have now some

281
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
features with the security in our

282
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
circuits are open source it's a

283
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,000
complement of the solution it's pretty

284
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,200
nice why because you can set here the o

285
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,320
right to set some format json with the

286
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,079
sonar cube that you can import you can

287
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,000
send it to your sonar cube and you have

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
some of the same solutions and you can

289
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
work with both of them right so because

290
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
our second was created by the security

291
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,320
team from super innovation it's a

292
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
brazilian company by the way and and

293
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,640
this company is responsible to maintain

294
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,440
this project it's it's pretty nice and i

295
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
have the contact with the team if you'd

296
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,680
like to send by the way i request to

297
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
to go to if you like this product you

298
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
can go here in the in the

299
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,240
in the community right you can click

300
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
here in community

301
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
and you have here the forum of the dot

302
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,399
com dot pr or vr and you have here the

303
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,560
english and you can click it here and

304
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,360
you can you know made the questions

305
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
right you can

306
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,760
write something and the team works a lot

307
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,399
here and on the other hand you have here

308
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,160
the github if you'd like to subject some

309
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,839
simple requests you can write here

310
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,800
in if my internet helped me and i can

311
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
open here the art tech page and yes you

312
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
have here you can request some pull

313
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,240
requests

314
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
right then you can improve this open

315
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,360
source project okay so let's return here

316
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,600
in our uh cli okay so i have here

317
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
some um codes vulnerable like in golang

318
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,800
and java and hotly node.js and php

319
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,519
inviter and by the way if you'd like to

320
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
make the same

321
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
the same test in your environment not in

322
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,880
your environment but if you'd like to

323
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
using this in your uh

324
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,639
in your virtual machine you can click

325
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,279
here in my github philip 86 you can

326
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,519
click here in our sec demo and you can

327
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,399
check here the same code right and this

328
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,120
is my that i am using if you'd like to

329
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,399
see another

330
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,160
in the um

331
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,000
or secure page in a github by the way

332
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,240
we have here some example as you can see

333
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,120
here examples you can click here and you

334
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,760
have more than one vulnerable quotes too

335
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,560
right and uh you can check you can you

336
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,040
know like using like a dm or something

337
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,279
like that okay so let me turn here i

338
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,200
have this code i will be using now the

339
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,120
order stack it's pretty simple i just

340
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,360
set in here for sec

341
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,079
start remember that and if i don't set

342
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,160
any other parameters in click enter take

343
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,480
a look what happened uh of course i need

344
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,610
two permissions but um

345
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,000
[Music]

346
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,760
okay

347
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,680
using some permissions

348
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,240
um or sec

349
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
start and i click enter take a look at

350
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,880
this

351
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,839
uh they set the

352
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,040
exactly uh

353
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,360
folder that i am then works right in

354
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,000
this case it's uh or sec demo take a

355
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,760
look this

356
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,480
exactly path that i'm working if you

357
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,519
would like to set another directory i

358
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,440
just i click enter now i just click to

359
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,399
dash

360
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,000
um

361
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,880
h

362
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,320
h dash p

363
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,199
equals double quote and i can set the

364
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,760
exactly direct the directory that i can

365
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,440
scan right

366
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,519
perform discount but i am showing now

367
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,600
during the presentations okay so it's

368
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,399
pretty simple now i'm running this in

369
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,959
these folders as you can see

370
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,240
this is the the main folder right and if

371
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,199
you remember that i'm showing here

372
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,920
here you can check i have more than one

373
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,720
folder vulnerable in golang java kotlin

374
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,600
node.js and whatever okay

375
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,560
and let's continue to wait

376
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,600
uh

377
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
i have some question is our second able

378
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,760
to find hardcoded encrypted passwords in

379
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
the quote yes

380
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,760
hubert's i don't know is this pronounced

381
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,399
correct but yes it's possible is one of

382
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,920
those features

383
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,680
of the rsac not just only the

384
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,000
the code vulnerable but they can find if

385
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
you have some hardcoded

386
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,600
password or aws key for example in the

387
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,839
code i have this information by the way

388
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,079
here in the documentations i don't

389
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,040
remember exactly where is the place

390
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
let me check

391
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
here

392
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,480
at three ways that our sex works let's

393
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
check here overview

394
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,240
and or sec how this works here

395
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,120
it's

396
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,040
should be in the end of the start here

397
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
or sec performing three types of the

398
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,120
analysis to the inside if there are any

399
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
security flux first is assass as i

400
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
mentioned and the second is leaks the

401
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
leaks checks the source cooled for a

402
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,680
possible leaks of credentials properties

403
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,120
inherited coded password as you're uh

404
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,600
asking me okay independence check it's

405
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,399
pretty nice you announced uh you can

406
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,480
analyze the project right depends to

407
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,040
check vulnerable in a third part

408
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,519
libraries like i see as sca it's a a

409
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,199
similar feature okay

410
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,079
and

411
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,399
and the answer is yes okay so let's

412
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,440
return here in our scanning

413
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,759
and of course it's usually the time it's

414
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,880
a

415
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,000
it's a 30 or 40 seconds but i am doing

416
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
the streaming in the similar you know

417
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,160
i'm doing this streaming from the

418
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,399
conference i'm seeing another monitoring

419
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,959
for my left side here my left side in

420
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,040
the monitor seeing that the stream and

421
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
the enemy is occurring and it's cutting

422
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
in the same time so three different uh

423
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,680
execution in the same machine okay and

424
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
i'm using the virtual machine on another

425
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,800
point okay so let him turn here the log

426
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,880
about the result actually i bought our

427
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,720
sack that we could turn here in the

428
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
beginning okay

429
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,800
so has it you can check here two minutes

430
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
by the way two three minutes i think two

431
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,959
minutes and a and a half okay so as you

432
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,240
can see here take a look at the

433
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,399
questions about the

434
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,440
um the password okay so here you can see

435
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,079
the leaks is a critical and

436
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,640
you can see the same severity the line

437
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,799
the column and the security tools it's

438
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,640
our sec engine take a look at this from

439
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
us from my opinion from my perspective

440
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
it's pretty nice because you can work

441
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,880
with more than one engine inside the rsi

442
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,199
okay and here as you can see security 2

443
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,359
and i will show you another different

444
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,559
engine inside of this project okay

445
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,720
the file exactly

446
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
that you can find the vulnerability as

447
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,120
you can see here right so

448
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,559
in this case

449
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,360
and that you can have here the code

450
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
it's hard to call it password as you can

451
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,440
see and take a look for example you if

452
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,960
you are in the security if you are a

453
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,280
security guy probably you know what is

454
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,160
what that means cwe right so the common

455
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
weakness and administration but if you

456
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,880
don't know if you if you don't uh if you

457
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
don't know about the security and if you

458
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,600
don't like exactly what it is you can

459
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,160
check you can click here the information

460
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,919
and you can

461
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,600
improve your acknowledgement and secure

462
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,679
stuff okay so if you click here take a

463
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,440
look at this the use of hardcoded

464
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,320
credentials so here the description the

465
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,559
standard decrease description and and

466
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,240
another point is

467
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,679
as i mentioned you can improve your

468
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,600
knowledge and insecure stuff okay you

469
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
can check here you can read about the

470
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,880
others uh child vulnerabilities related

471
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
to this main vulnerability as you can

472
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
see here it's not a definition from the

473
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,440
felipe okay it's from i3 okay it's from

474
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
cwe

475
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
and it's a pretty cool uh

476
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,480
research to gain the knowledge okay so

477
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,080
all those informations you can check

478
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,400
here in the results let's check another

479
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,640
and a java is the same case in this in

480
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,720
this case in this case as you can see

481
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,640
take a look this is the director in the

482
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,960
exactly folder here a epidoc java okay

483
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,760
so if you have you have the a um

484
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
you can they will check all those

485
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,320
folders inside the main the main project

486
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,880
okay so the security tools is for sec

487
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,919
engine

488
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,440
here i would like to show you take a

489
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
look at this python the severities

490
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,600
medium security tools is a bandit it's

491
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
not our sec engine it's a vending it's

492
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,039
another engine right so you have more

493
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,520
than one engine inside of the same code

494
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
from my perspective it's pretty pretty

495
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,360
nice and here you can check another

496
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,919
security tool is a gold sack it's

497
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,960
another engine inside of this okay and

498
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
another question from maggie it's what

499
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
the difference between our sets and 45

500
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,760
the good questions uh i don't know i

501
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
don't work with the 45 by the way and i

502
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,080
don't have more knowledgement with the

503
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,679
fortify but for my perspective

504
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,000
when they are second it was created

505
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,400
basically it's because there's some

506
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,520
limitations of the programming language

507
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,400
and tools about the other tools

508
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
right for example maybe fortify uh

509
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
doesn't work with that a specific

510
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,400
programming language okay

511
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,200
maybe we can check what the exactly

512
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,559
language is

513
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,280
probably they works with the java or you

514
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,480
know gold pyramids is the very unknown

515
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,799
tools but for example i don't know it's

516
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,360
i'm supposed to okay uh for example who

517
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,080
works with a rugby or

518
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,880
elixir you know it's you need to check

519
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,840
exactly about

520
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,760
them that program language and tools

521
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
like kubernetes as i mentioned okay

522
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,799
tabla for me or whatever okay so as you

523
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,280
can see here we have many different logs

524
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,559
and uh

525
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,799
in different tools from my perspective

526
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,960
it was pretty nice so here take a look

527
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,679
at this the possible hard coded password

528
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,159
they can inform you and you can have

529
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,880
these informations in your cli as you

530
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,360
can see here and the total 10 possible

531
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,240
vulnerabilities were found we classify

532
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,440
them one critical two highs three medium

533
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,039
and four low right so this is the first

534
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,520
uh point another point is if you have

535
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,039
for example if you are a developer and

536
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,760
you work with uh uh some ide for example

537
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,240
like a ds code you can click here next

538
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,960
station you can set the order set here

539
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,679
click enter and you have here

540
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,080
you can click and you can install

541
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,400
in your vs code take a look at this and

542
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
now it's here and after that you can

543
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,679
click and run

544
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,559
and

545
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,559
hold on horizon starting to announce in

546
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,200
your code as you can see here below and

547
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,760
they are working in the in this midi

548
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,039
time they are

549
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,840
performing the iscani in your code in

550
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,480
this case in this code and my mainly

551
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,240
code here okay so they are works in the

552
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,360
vsc

553
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,480
code okay and um

554
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
because you can imagine in this case for

555
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,679
example it is in a cli okay so you can

556
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,480
check your code and you can improve by

557
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
the way if you see here some parameters

558
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,400
or for example like uh uh in this case

559
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,559
about the password for example it's uh

560
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,480
you know how to coded password i need to

561
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,039
change this in my code so you can go

562
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,039
there for example in the

563
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,280
in the in the python here and clicking

564
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,200
for example here you can check

565
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
okay the password because in the clear

566
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,840
text the secret using the clear test

567
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,559
okay and you can change this and and

568
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,880
after that you can perform again and see

569
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,600
the results okay so it's it's pretty

570
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,360
nice because you have the information

571
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,000
here in a cli but from my perspective if

572
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,640
you work with ide it's it's

573
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,559
it's pretty cool because you have the

574
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,960
information in your hand if you you work

575
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,600
with ide to help you

576
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,159
like if you are a programmer of course a

577
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,480
default developer right and you have

578
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,360
here more than one way to see the

579
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,240
informations okay so let's wait about

580
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,159
the

581
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,840
time to

582
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,159
analyze this is scanning and after that

583
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,400
i will show with us the last one and i

584
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,640
will finish the presentation about the

585
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,440
what is possible to use the autosac here

586
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,280
in your cli not irclot sorry in your

587
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,960
pipeline as i will show you here

588
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,039
installations so first of all i'm

589
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,679
installing using in my local environment

590
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,600
you can use in the windows platform for

591
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,720
example

592
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,000
so here's some

593
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,159
manual installations if you don't like

594
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,480
to use in in image docker you can run it

595
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,799
here and i will show you after this uh

596
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,280
scanning how you can using you how you

597
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,360
can improve your pipeline however you

598
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,559
can use in here negative actions or aws

599
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,799
code build and you can use it as your

600
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,280
sql ci for example or jenkins or azure

601
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,080
devops pipeline or each live cicd right

602
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,559
so here's some examples that you can use

603
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,039
in your pipeline i will show you here in

604
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,360
this in my github actions by the way

605
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
okay let me return here if ever i have

606
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,200
the results it's running

607
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,159
yet

608
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,240
uh i still yeah it's still running

609
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,640
actually and um

610
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,240
but i will explain to you in the time

611
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,320
okay it's pretty simple as you can see

612
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,240
here i will generate a file inside of my

613
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,720
actions i will create a job right in my

614
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,960
pipeline and as you can see here i don't

615
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,799
know it is small but

616
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,000
let me

617
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
show you better here it's just a simple

618
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,919
run right i will perform the curl again

619
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,279
as you can see

620
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,400
right and then we install the bash the

621
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
the binder and i will call the or sec

622
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,240
start and i set set dash p has

623
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
information about the path okay i will

624
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,860
put here the the

625
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,120
[Applause]

626
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,679
the slash it's a it's uh the main

627
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,400
director that we execute and after that

628
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,919
i use dash

629
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,840
um e okay

630
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,760
why because i will shut the flag through

631
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,679
because if they

632
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,400
find some vulnerability they can broke

633
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,360
the pipeline okay in this case if they

634
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,760
receive some error one in this case

635
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,960
because they found some vulnerabilities

636
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,240
they i can broke my pipeline and i can

637
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,799
return to the developer and i can i can

638
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,679
uh

639
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,919
make some adjustment and the code okay

640
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,320
so let me turn here it's running it's

641
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,039
okay let's check it's okay it's okay

642
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,600
let's return here in there or sack where

643
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,639
is there sec here

644
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,440
our sec

645
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,840
take a look this the results as you can

646
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,360
see here so you can click here and licks

647
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,200
you can put the mouse

648
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,080
above the the line as you can see here

649
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,159
the informations about the

650
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,200
um

651
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
the whole elevated right so in this case

652
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,120
it's a leak as i mentioned you have here

653
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,400
the hash reference about this log

654
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,919
the python it's another um

655
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,000
engine from the same vulnerability in

656
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,919
this case because you can execute some

657
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,120
uh

658
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,760
execution command command and take a

659
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
look this below here in the javascript

660
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
it's another vulnerability it's uh if

661
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
you click here and as you can see here

662
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,600
it's another

663
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,520
it's a different reference as you can

664
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,320
see it's another cwe difference it's a

665
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,640
78 here and if you see here

666
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,559
you can check here it's that it's a cwe

667
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,000
7 9 8 is a another reference because

668
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,720
obviously it's a different tuna right so

669
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,200
that's my point here and you can see

670
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
here the warning in this case for

671
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,559
example uh

672
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,080
like uh that you have here the

673
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,799
explanation about use a weak

674
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,279
uh cryptography primitive so

675
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,919
it's a suggestion to change okay and you

676
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,240
can find here they all called

677
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,559
vulnerability vulnerable vulnerable

678
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,440
actually

679
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,760
aimed exactly called in id from my

680
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,320
perspective it's pretty pretty nice okay

681
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,720
and let me hit that in the code and i

682
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,320
will execute this to finish my

683
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,520
presentation

684
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,799
and i will

685
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,520
click here in my actions

686
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,360
as you can see i don't have any actions

687
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,520
to running now and i need to set some

688
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,960
workflow in my youtube actions

689
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,840
yeah you create here the folder in my

690
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,520
github

691
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,159
i will create here there are sec eml i

692
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,880
need to create this of this file here

693
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,799
first

694
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,279
let me close here i will simple like

695
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,520
this i will cop this reference here in

696
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,919
the installation process as i mentioned

697
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,960
i will cop this

698
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,320
it's here

699
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,279
i will pass here

700
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,760
and again this is i'm setting the job

701
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,320
here in my github actions are you

702
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,480
requesting a curl i use setting the

703
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,799
command in 85 i find some little bit

704
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,720
that we have we have 10 vulnerabilities

705
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,880
here and after that i will broke my

706
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,600
pipeline okay so it's pretty simple let

707
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,719
me turn here in my

708
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,919
i need to add

709
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,679
this new file in my github okay

710
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,640
i will commit this

711
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,659
[Music]

712
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,279
very creative

713
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,760
okay i have here the new folder and the

714
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,240
logs right and uh

715
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,600
push right push

716
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,158
and uh

717
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,600
in my case i'm using mastery

718
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,240
okay

719
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,240
set my password because i use

720
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,960
two factor authorization and after that

721
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,600
i will move this document to my

722
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,520
environment let's check here in my

723
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,080
and my actions here let me click here in

724
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,919
action again and take a look at this i'm

725
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,440
running the rsac demo in my pipeline now

726
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
i'm executing my actions to see

727
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,120
about the jobs executing as you can see

728
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,399
here right

729
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,880
and i'm setting the virtual environment

730
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,440
and let's do i'm checking the code as

731
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,000
you can see and running our second and

732
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,919
as you can see the log it's

733
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,760
you know and almost the same that i will

734
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,840
show you in the cli

735
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,679
and uh and how it works okay it's let me

736
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,880
check here

737
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,080
okay they will be using here in this

738
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,799
uh

739
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,720
path in this directory okay

740
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,600
running a job

741
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,679
let's check here

742
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,840
some information they are running in the

743
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,960
pipeline

744
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,600
so you can integrate this with your

745
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
pipeline you can you know develop

746
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
something and take a look at this

747
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
running running rsac

748
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,240
security here is the common the command

749
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,159
again as i mentioned right so the

750
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,000
installation process

751
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,919
you know it's a small one let me show

752
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,480
you

753
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,039
it's better

754
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,880
not too much

755
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,440
so here the installation process the set

756
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,000
of the execution of the or sec okay

757
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,720
setting download the binary and all

758
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,600
those steps okay and the log and as you

759
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,320
can see here the airport the same lock

760
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,720
the same information as you can see here

761
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
the scanning the leaks all those

762
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,159
information have here and at the end

763
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,840
as you can see all those logs and take a

764
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,960
look at this

765
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,360
the process of import process completed

766
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,960
exit code one why because we found a

767
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,320
vulnerability so because of this i set

768
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,799
dash a equals

769
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,720
double quote through

770
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,080
i can't go to the productions uh of the

771
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,600
apk authentication can go to the

772
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,960
productions okay

773
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,039
so here as you can see

774
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,679
we have the information and by the way i

775
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,520
think

776
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,600
yes and by the way

777
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
if you see here

778
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,880
i don't know if you can see but i

779
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,039
received here the information of my cell

780
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,159
phone about the rsac of the year

781
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,279
okay so yes that is it that is it i

782
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,039
finished my presentation of course we

783
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,279
have here another possibility if you

784
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,039
click here in web applications an

785
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,200
overview i don't have a time to explain

786
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
more about that i think i think i passed

787
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,679
at the time and you can install in your

788
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,480
environment you can have the manager to

789
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,960
manage the vulnerabilities for example

790
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,559
you can find a different vulnerability

791
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,080
by developer or by language by project

792
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,360
it's a pretty pretty nice

793
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,559
manager i fully recommend you install

794
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,480
you prove you can

795
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,799
you can works you can improve your

796
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,840
developer team and after that right so

797
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,600
that's my point here

798
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
to you okay i don't know if having

799
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,799
questions

800
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,679
and thank you so much for this time and

801
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,679
sorry for this

802
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,440
time to know if i passed the time but

803
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,840
sorry for that

804
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,720
you
