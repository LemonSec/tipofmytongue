1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,519
hi everyone my name is luke ogawski and

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,440
i will be talking in english today about

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,960
the dark network's wars and

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,680
communication as discussed with uh adam

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,920
previously and typically we do deliver

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
those sessions in polish but you know

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,800
it's a config confidence legends and

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,160
conference so

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,080
english is kind of almost like a

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
mandatory at least that's what i thought

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,800
uh initially so anyway uh i will be

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,440
talking or focusing mostly on the two

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,200
topics one is the

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,520
internet transport and if you know me

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
i'm typically the routing guy not so

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,399
much security guy but i will be i would

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,480
like to share with you some of the ideas

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,520
about securing uh well first of all

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,760
problems within the internet transport

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,480
and then some ideas how to secure that

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,320
and then we will look at

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,000
scaling out the protection for

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
applications

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,480
traveling over this transport right and

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,920
during this

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,600
confidence edition you have a lot of

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,840
sessions about applications and malware

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
and stuff like that

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,119
and i don't want to touch this because

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,360
this is kind of a fluffy topic for me at

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
least but let's let's focus on those

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
things that i'm i believe i'm i have

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,600
something to say

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
and uh why

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,439
trafficking or inspection of the traffic

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,600
without encryption because this is

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,040
hardly scalable

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,880
nowadays and i will talk about this

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,600
later during the session and at the same

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,759
time obviously as matthew green said at

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,600
some point in time

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,400
we

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,240
we are dealing with security because

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,560
it's hard right some of the things we we

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,119
have to think about before the attackers

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,240
will be

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
willing to think about them so this is

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,240
why we are talking about stuff that

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,640
typically doesn't matter for for all

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
kind of different id and security

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,560
departments right they like to decrypt

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,119
the traffic and then make a decision uh

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,159
if they should drop or allow it

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,200
so

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280
if you don't know me i'm i'm the routing

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,399
guy

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,399
i moved recently i was leading the

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,239
technical organization at cisco and here

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,479
in poland i moved two years ago to

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,920
security business unit which is

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
essentially the team that is building

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,959
the security products

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,080
uh from cisco and if you would like to

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,760
poke around

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,360
go ahead and you know target my site

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680
hopefully you will not break anything

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
that's not already broken if you have

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
any comments or whatever else just go

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,040
ahead and i'm linking here the the

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
presentation director because i was

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
already a guest at confidence and

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
typically i was talking about network

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,280
segmentation the best practices for

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,239
service providers virtualization stuff

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,120
like

76
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,000
that that actually helps to secure the

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,120
basic platform level uh

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
traffic that goes throughout your

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,000
network and then goes into the into the

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,319
applications i was also delivering a

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,480
couple of sessions that

82
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,720
did demonstrate how to actually attack

83
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
the network and what kind of information

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,560
defenders can get it from that obviously

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,879
the world move on because as you can see

86
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,400
i was

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
last present at confidence in 2010 right

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,920
now we are 2021 but some of the topics

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,879
actually haven't changed that

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,760
much so obviously everybody is talking

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
about the impact of the of the of the

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,120
kovi tried and kovitz just demonstrated

93
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,799
that everything can be moved to the

94
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,480
internet base almost everything can be

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,720
moved to internet-based connectivity the

96
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,080
problem with the internet-based

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,159
connectivity or problem with moving that

98
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,879
in a kind of quick pace in a situation

99
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,280
where for example you have like 24 hours

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,599
to move your entire workforce to work

101
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,599
remotely without access to the office is

102
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,120
that actually some of the companies

103
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
decided to implement something we call

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
security biosecurity right and i do

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
agree to some extent that it works in

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,159
some of the cases and there are a couple

107
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,720
of interesting blocks around that that

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
showcase that this approach was

109
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,120
effective in terms of slowing down the

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,599
attackers and i can agree with that but

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,480
then

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,920
it doesn't really matter from the

113
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,439
perspective of the big picture because

114
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,159
this is exactly the exercise i did like

115
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,238
a year ago and i just repeated this two

116
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,358
days ago

117
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,358
setting up a couple of honeypots or

118
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,959
virtual machines essentially listening

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,520
to the ips around the world some of the

120
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
ip address space was never used or

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,240
not used for the last couple of months

122
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
some of the ip address space was used

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
pretty frequently and as you can see

124
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
just playing with the ports that ssh is

125
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,600
actually listening to doesn't give you

126
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,639
much in terms of the defensive posture

127
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,560
so if you want to implement something

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
fast and your id department or security

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
department was not actually ready to to

130
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
start doing that kind of things it seems

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000
that you may not have a

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
big chances of the uh you know surviving

133
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
any kind of attacks by just

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
implementing security by obscurity or

135
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
not implementing anything at all right

136
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,440
so

137
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,600
right now if you are after two years if

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,199
you are still thinking in that kind of

139
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,320
terms in terms of your main strategy for

140
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,880
companies survival just stop and start

141
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
to really

142
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
work on some of the uh

143
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,080
big questions with regards to how you

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,600
should approach the security at least

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,240
that's my that's my approach right and

146
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,120
the other thing is that um scanning and

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
gathering information about your

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
potential target company or whatever

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,680
else today it takes literally

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
you know seconds in some of the cases

151
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,039
obviously if you want to be extra

152
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,520
careful you can take hours or days even

153
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
but at the end of the day i just did a

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,639
test

155
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
mass scanning the entire polish ip

156
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,440
address space takes over 15 minutes if

157
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,039
you have a pretty lousy internet

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,960
connection like 50 000 packets per

159
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,160
second

160
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
is essentially each and every within the

161
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,000
reach of the dsl line dsl in connected

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,160
internet line if you have access to some

163
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,319
cloud-based services the entire internet

164
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
can be scanned within around that kind

165
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
of time if you really want to

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,639
and that's a actually completely

167
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,479
different discussion we will follow up

168
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,520
on that

169
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,160
later on maybe not during this this um

170
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
presentation unless there there will be

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,759
questions but anyway this is something

172
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,880
that needs to be taken into

173
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,400
consideration if you are organizing

174
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,319
anything ad hoc with regards to security

175
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,440
architecture

176
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
and at the same time if you believe that

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
you don't have actually anything worth

178
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,319
abusing just remember that everything is

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,960
essentially open or potentially a vector

180
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,440
for for abusing the recent

181
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,240
attacks on uh pro bond with sterling

182
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
when we're stealing the the

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,360
the

184
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,039
internet connectivity are kind of

185
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,120
amazing from the perspective of trying

186
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,199
to do anything with that but at the end

187
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,960
of the day if you think about it it's

188
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
just the value that somebody is willing

189
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
to use and somebody else is willing to

190
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
to pay for right so if you are doing

191
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,039
that kind of thing you are

192
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
banned with sharing

193
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
with the rest of the internet somebody

194
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
may at the end of the day start to abuse

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,599
this

196
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
so let's focus on the transport right

197
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,680
let's go back to the to the agenda and

198
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,840
let's focus on how we can tackle and

199
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
protect the

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,039
the transport what's kind of what's the

201
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,639
first problem the first problem is that

202
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,240
if you are thinking about

203
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,440
internet worldwide internet connectivity

204
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
you will likely see that

205
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
there is a very

206
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
thin line between the outage and the

207
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,680
attack

208
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,919
actually in most of the cases initially

209
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,319
the attacks on some kind of

210
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,599
infrastructure or services are typically

211
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,639
uh interpreted as simply in an outage if

212
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,720
it lasts for extended period of time

213
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,479
somebody will start to look or talk

214
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,160
about and i may have may may find that

215
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,479
actually you are thinking about or you

216
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,240
are dealing with some kind of attack

217
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
right that you cannot contain or cannot

218
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,280
unfortunately

219
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
sustain and then it's maybe an outage

220
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
because suddenly you not only are

221
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,199
dealing with attack you just lost your

222
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,360
data center or whatever else right and

223
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
this is just an example of the of the

224
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
latest statistics from 2021 and you you

225
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
can see that this is not something the

226
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
outage within the internet and outage

227
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
here is defined as some

228
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,599
service provider

229
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,840
autonomous system or some kind of bigger

230
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,000
company as you can see either the

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,599
network which is a service provider or

232
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,440
public cloud which is obviously the

233
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,000
public cloud provider is experiencing

234
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
extended loss of service with regards to

235
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,240
whatever they are they are

236
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
offering it's pretty common topic

237
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,240
almost like

238
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,639
in every every given moment somebody

239
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,640
somewhere around the world is having

240
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
some uh internet uh connectivity

241
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,799
problems and in some of the cases

242
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,880
obviously this is just an uh the outage

243
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
right somebody cut the fire if i were

244
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,919
somebody

245
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,919
data center is on fire or things like

246
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
that but at the end of the day some of

247
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,720
the incidents uh end up being classified

248
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,560
as a tax right

249
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,800
and the problem here that at least the

250
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,320
problem we are dealing with today during

251
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
this presentation

252
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
is the is the fact that in some of the

253
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,560
cases

254
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,880
uh those will be

255
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,519
those will be true attacks right and let

256
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,480
us consider one of the examples of those

257
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,519
those attacks uh and this is the

258
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,640
this is the uh some kind of topology uh

259
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,200
that shows a couple of uh autonomous

260
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,279
systems connected together typically

261
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,760
autonomous systems belongs to the

262
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,640
it's a kind of logical concept tied to

263
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
the how internet works and

264
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,800
typically autonomous system belongs to

265
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
company some of the companies obviously

266
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,720
have number of autonomous systems

267
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
because they are using this for for for

268
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,680
different functions and as you can see

269
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,080
in this example we are autonomous system

270
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,320
451. of course the numbers are just

271
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
examples please

272
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,279
don't use them unless you are dealing

273
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,600
with a a lab that is not connected to

274
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
the internet

275
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,320
and we have a

276
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
pretty nice drawing of couple of

277
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,080
autonomous systems connected together

278
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
and they are exchanging the traffic

279
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,640
essentially

280
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,279
bgpa protocol is the protocol that ties

281
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
everything together and is used to

282
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,560
advertise uh availability of uh of

283
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,120
access to a specific prefix

284
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,640
so if i'm

285
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,959
owning 45.1

286
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,240
16 i can advertise using bgp hey folks

287
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,079
if you want to reach anything within

288
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,160
this address space please connect to me

289
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,959
or send your traffic towards my routers

290
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,560
and you see on the right side of the

291
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,279
screen that we have free services right

292
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,959
we have www service which is located

293
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,600
under

294
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,200
45.105.06 and zero nine couple of

295
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,399
different services

296
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,519
uh and also obviously users connecting

297
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,720
to that so unfortunately

298
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
the way the internet is built or the way

299
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
that the bgp was initially fought uh

300
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,079
moved the trust directly to the people

301
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,839
that are operating those routers so if

302
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,399
you are thinking about saying okay this

303
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,000
is the the

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,160
the internet it's it is working but i

305
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,560
want to abuse some of the services it's

306
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
pretty easy or until recently it was

307
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
very easy to to abuse the trust

308
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,279
relationship between the faults that are

309
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,600
handling those routers and how

310
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,160
by using crowding right by using bgp and

311
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
by using the fact that if you are a

312
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,320
router and you are

313
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,839
peering with

314
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,079
someone else using the bjp protocol you

315
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,480
can actually start to advertise prefixes

316
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
that are not belonging to you right so

317
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
let's assume we have this malicious

318
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,680
actor here in i-666

319
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
and those folks typically do have their

320
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
own address space or maybe they already

321
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
stole it from from someone else that

322
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,839
this is not the most important part of

323
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,320
the story but at some point in time they

324
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,839
will decide okay folks and right now we

325
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,880
will start to advertise more accurate

326
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,800
prefix or longer prefix to the

327
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
destination that is of special interest

328
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,839
for us right and as you can see while we

329
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,800
as a victim in uh autonomous system 451

330
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,839
are essentially

331
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,040
uh advertising uh a pretty broad space

332
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,160
right slash 16 for ipv4

333
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,120
and those guys are actually announcing a

334
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,000
more specific prefix which means that

335
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,399
when each and every router will make a

336
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,279
decision about routing this this traffic

337
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,920
they will decide okay the more accurate

338
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,760
or more specific prefix will be more

339
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,839
important for us or more

340
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,480
attractive than any other prefix that we

341
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,880
see and obviously the traffic will be or

342
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,920
the advertisement will then be flew that

343
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
across the bgp ecosystem with the

344
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,839
autonomous system 666 suddenly as the

345
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,880
owner of the slash 24 and this leads to

346
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,360
a pretty interesting situation you as a

347
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,279
victim will still be able to initiate

348
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,360
the traffic to any kind of services that

349
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,200
you have somewhere in the internet or

350
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,120
maybe somewhere within the network of

351
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,240
your partner

352
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,639
but the returning traffic if it will be

353
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,440
uh if it will be if it will belong to

354
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
the other space that was recently

355
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,240
advertised by the malicious partner will

356
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,639
actually get back in most of the cases

357
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,560
because obviously that's kind of not

358
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,519
zero one decision almost like thanks to

359
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,920
the bgp protocol but we don't have too

360
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,440
much time to discuss the specific

361
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
details of that most of the traffic will

362
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
actually return to the to the malicious

363
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,920
act right because he is advertising this

364
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,320
this address space and in most of the

365
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,920
cases that kind of advertisement will

366
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,560
also be widely accepted so you have

367
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
right now a situation when the malicious

368
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,920
actor can actually intercept your

369
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
communication unfortunately or

370
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,600
fortunately internet-based connectivity

371
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
is usually both ways right so you have

372
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,519
to establish two-way communication to be

373
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,880
able to

374
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,959
exchange any kind of data apart from

375
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,040
just saying high and high back and

376
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
that's about it because you cannot

377
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,480
sustain the flow right

378
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,320
so what is uh what are what are those

379
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
malicious actors doing is that actually

380
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
they are also redirecting the traffic

381
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,399
right so apart from just sniffing the

382
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,320
traffic and being able to record it or

383
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,880
maybe intercept and modify the traffic

384
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,360
on the fly they will also redirect the

385
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,519
traffic and inject it back to the

386
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,040
original destination so the victim can

387
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,600
actually think that he or she is talking

388
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,800
to the service and it may have a bit

389
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
more latency than typically but at the

390
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,040
end of the day it works right so why

391
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,680
work now the problem that we right now

392
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,079
describe is so-called bgp hijacking and

393
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,720
this is uh almost like a common uh

394
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,199
common technique used to use today

395
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,519
and uh we were talking about that 10

396
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,360
years ago 15 years ago as a kind of

397
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,959
you know interesting technique for

398
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
people that are dealing with bgp right

399
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,440
now if you look into any kind of monitor

400
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,360
or bgp monitoring there are a couple of

401
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,160
such

402
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,800
services pretty popular around the world

403
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
provided by by a couple of different

404
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,279
vendors and some of the communities as

405
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,160
well this is essentially happening daily

406
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,440
uh for uh

407
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
in a number of uh instances right you

408
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,560
can

409
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,160
read through a couple of couple of

410
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,480
examples here some of the bgp hijacking

411
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
is happening indeed because somebody

412
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,440
just make them made a mistake right and

413
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,839
they pick typically those are titles if

414
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
this is a mistake that suddenly covers

415
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,000
completely different graphics that you

416
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,880
were

417
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,360
you were you you are using daily it's

418
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
hardly a mistake somebody was trying to

419
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,800
do something with your prefix and

420
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,959
unfortunately they failed or maybe the

421
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,160
automation engine failed and actually

422
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,079
advertised this prefix towards the

423
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,240
internet which is considered obviously a

424
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,480
bad practice along among the service

425
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,880
provider community

426
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,440
so this is happening daily right now and

427
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
the problem is that the

428
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
the issue got hot right

429
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,600
and one of the big or or pretty

430
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,720
interesting examples if china china owns

431
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
to be very big service providers the

432
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,680
only ones that are able to operate fully

433
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,399
china unicom and china telecom china

434
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,440
unicom entered the u.s ecosystem trying

435
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,920
to get some more uh traffic towards the

436
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,240
network they established routing routers

437
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,440
in the in the

438
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
points of pressure presence across the

439
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,959
united states throughout the 2000 2010

440
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,519
and then they started to pretty

441
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,920
aggressively redirect or hijack the

442
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,800
traffic

443
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
and i was

444
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,279
always

445
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,880
almost like okay

446
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,199
because that kind of incidents happen

447
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,839
but at some point in time in 2018 china

448
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,240
unicom started to aggressively target

449
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,959
not only u.s enterprises but they also

450
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,040
started to target department of defense

451
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,880
networks and some other networks that

452
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
were pretty critical to whatever us was

453
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,800
doing right and you may have heard about

454
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,759
some of the attacks on the on the um us

455
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,839
critical infrastructure stuff like that

456
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,800
that was almost like uh connected or the

457
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,639
end effect of hijacking some of the

458
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,720
address space why because if you can

459
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,399
sniff the traffic and you can actually

460
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,160
look what's going on how the people are

461
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,320
logging in what kind of information they

462
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
are exchanging attacking such network or

463
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,279
attacking such victims is easier then

464
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,000
and in a kind of unprecedented uh

465
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,120
situation fcc us fcc at some point in

466
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,679
time in 2018 decided that's enough is

467
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,880
enough right

468
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,599
and uh they decided to completely remove

469
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,319
china unicom from u.s and they they

470
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
forbid the company to operate and

471
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
advertise

472
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,799
any prefixes and essentially provide any

473
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,160
kind of operation

474
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,119
for the

475
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,319
on the u.s soil and what the china is

476
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,160
trying right now to do is actually they

477
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,919
are using proxy networks and i will show

478
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
you some examples later but you can see

479
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
that in 2019 after the the action was

480
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
executed they started to actually move

481
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,520
some of the operation to proxy network

482
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,000
so-called proxy networks right so any

483
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
countries that are operating close to

484
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,360
america or u.s and like mexico

485
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,280
barbados antigua

486
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,520
any kind of european service providers

487
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,799
that can also

488
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,440
uh do tricks with inter intercepting

489
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
traffic and then redirecting it at least

490
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,880
for the for short periods of uh time so

491
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
we see this uh daily even in poland

492
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
which is kind of interesting because on

493
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,480
one side some of the folks never learn

494
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,320
recently pakistani telecom this is just

495
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,360
the data from from august so last last

496
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,679
month right

497
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,919
telecom again intercepted some of the

498
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,320
t-mobile traffic that that time this

499
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,880
time it wasn't youtube but still a

500
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,440
pretty interesting uh target for for

501
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,600
hijacking the traffic russia is

502
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
constantly hijacking some ukraine

503
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,120
traffic which is kind of obvious given

504
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
what's happening right now

505
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
and specifically the prefixes belong to

506
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,919
i.t companies within the ukraine

507
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
and right now we are also being targeted

508
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,520
or poland is being targeted some of the

509
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,760
polish companies are being targeted by

510
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,080
the proxy so-called proxy networks and

511
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,640
again those are typically south of south

512
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,080
america and sometimes within if you go

513
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,720
through the history of different uh bgp

514
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,039
monitoring services you can also find

515
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,520
some european autonomous system numbers

516
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,760
hijacking polish prefixes which is

517
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,919
likely a sign of times to come right

518
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,760
this is this is something that we have

519
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,600
to right now live with the problem

520
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
obviously is that we would like to stop

521
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,520
that right and there is work on going on

522
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,600
about that with the

523
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,720
with the new concept of uh standardizing

524
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,440
the

525
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
standardizing so-called secure internal

526
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
domain routing

527
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
we already have a

528
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
solution to most of the problems with

529
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
the pgp hijacking we can verify the

530
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
prefixes and we can verify the origin

531
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
autonomous system that is advertising

532
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
those prefixes and the only problem

533
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,320
right now is just uh you know deploying

534
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,600
that right

535
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,320
as i will show you in a moment this got

536
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,200
accelerated in 2018 after those attacks

537
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,840
in in us when it become obvious that

538
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,000
actually uh you know any kind of

539
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,559
critical network within u.s uh big

540
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
network providers or big network address

541
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,720
blocks like amazon azure or google cloud

542
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,400
will also be prone to that kind of

543
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,720
attacks and everybody started to deploy

544
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,600
uh

545
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,840
with regards to verifying those prefixes

546
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,280
and actually verifying the peering

547
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,960
relationships right

548
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,440
you claim to be my partner that's great

549
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,320
but are you are you advertising the

550
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,799
prefixes that you can advertise right

551
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,480
this is obviously a

552
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,919
big challenge for if you are dealing

553
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
with transit service providers but for

554
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,440
uh and

555
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,080
and stations and autonomous systems

556
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,120
endpoint

557
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
uh handling some endpoint services

558
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
within their own and actually just

559
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,799
multi-home to number of service

560
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,799
providers within the internet this is

561
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,960
easier right and it almost like can be

562
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,240
executed

563
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,880
automatically so one of the things you

564
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
would like to probably think about if

565
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,480
you own an ip address space either v4 or

566
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,559
v6 is to go to your favorite uh

567
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,600
original internet registry and certify

568
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
your prefixes and then they can be

569
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,919
validated and if they can be validated

570
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,440
anybody in the internet can make a

571
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
decision if they want to accept

572
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,960
potentially spoofed

573
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,760
advertisement

574
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,720
of your prefixes or they will drop this

575
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
on the floor right and the more service

576
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
providers are joining this this kind of

577
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,559
movement right or deployment of the new

578
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,960
technique actually the better the

579
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,480
chances are that you will pre your

580
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
prefix will not be uh hijacked in the in

581
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,360
the internet and this is just one of the

582
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,440
examples you will see more in the

583
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,880
offline version of the of the

584
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,159
presentation this is for ios 6c

585
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,159
we are still is 459 we still have a

586
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,679
connection to 300 and s400 and this you

587
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,480
if you can see on the routing table we

588
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,720
see a prefix and again this is just an

589
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,360
example right i i'm making this up on

590
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,280
the fly you see that we have a prefix

591
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,840
2.58 that

592
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,799
24 and it's actually advertised by both

593
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,760
of the

594
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,280
upstreams from us right so is 300 which

595
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,280
is typically or for example 3.6 and then

596
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,400
we have the same advertisement from 4.6

597
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,200
because we are running this rpkii

598
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,919
subsystem we see the letter here on the

599
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,559
on the first column which is says v

600
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,679
which is verified or i which is invalid

601
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,760
right there are essentially three states

602
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
that their prefix can be validated too

603
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,080
either valid invalid or simply not found

604
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,799
so not certified yet right so if this is

605
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,039
not found we can still accept it because

606
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,440
something somebody or people responsible

607
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,000
for the prefix were simply careless and

608
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,840
and they they didn't certify the prefix

609
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
uh yet but if something is invalid

610
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,000
somebody is playing games right the

611
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,480
prefix was signed it is in the

612
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,280
uh

613
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,600
regional internet registry cache but

614
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,360
actually it doesn't mean that the

615
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,120
version that you are receiving doesn't

616
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,000
mean meet one of the requirements either

617
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,480
the prefixes are wrong or the origin

618
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,640
autonomous system is wrong right so if

619
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
you implement that kind of policy that i

620
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,520
just

621
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,919
sketched here right depending on the

622
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,760
state of validation do something with

623
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,799
the prefix once you do execute that on a

624
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,480
routing table

625
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,880
the prefix that is invalid should simply

626
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,559
vanish from the routing table shouldn't

627
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,039
be actually you don't consider it as a

628
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,360
valid route within your routing space

629
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,480
which again

630
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,559
from the perspective of stub network

631
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,320
like connected multi-home customer

632
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
doesn't make much more sense because you

633
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,480
have to send the traffic anyway unless

634
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,240
you want to go the hardware and actually

635
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
drop the traffic proactively which is

636
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,559
also a possibility but for transit

637
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,200
providers and big content providers this

638
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
starts to make a difference right and

639
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,960
again just a a a small ask for all of

640
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,360
you try to to

641
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
certify your prefixes this is the

642
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,840
current situation in ripe almost like

643
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,080
half of the prefixes are signed already

644
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,039
we are still looking for 125 000 to be

645
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,520
certified but this is is progressing

646
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,080
pretty pretty nicely and as you can see

647
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,520
in 2018 it started in 2018 and then it

648
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,760
went up right now there is a massive

649
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,520
number of events and massive number of

650
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
trainings that show how easy it is to go

651
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
through the certification of your profit

652
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,480
prefix essentially using ripe ripe

653
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,720
website it takes like maximum five

654
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,480
minutes to go through certification of

655
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,120
your own prefixes right and again

656
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,960
by all means try to try to do that

657
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,799
because you are doing a great service

658
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,039
today to the worldwide

659
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,080
internet

660
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,039
now

661
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,440
this will of course extend right uh

662
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,960
we've heard recently that not only you

663
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,720
you will have more and more satellite

664
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
bound communication some of the

665
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,159
companies will use the satellite

666
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,080
communication as a typical lines because

667
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,279
they are

668
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,720
the the places when where they are

669
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,400
operating are typically not well

670
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,240
connected to the landline uh internet or

671
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
the connectivity is so poor that they

672
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,039
have to use couple of connections at the

673
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,520
same time trying to use the the

674
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,000
bandwidth of aggregate of those those

675
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,120
links right

676
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,799
so one of the things that will likely

677
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,480
happen is that we will have more and

678
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,960
more companies operating protocols like

679
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,120
bgp protocols essentially for dynamic

680
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
routing over the satellite links and

681
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,200
because you can easily spoof the traffic

682
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,640
and can listen to the traffic and

683
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,200
using less and less investment in your

684
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,000
own

685
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,640
resources or devices you can start to

686
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,799
send the traffic if you know how to do

687
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,159
that

688
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,720
chances are we will see things like one

689
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,559
in space and the same time

690
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,039
hijacking prefixes coming in from space

691
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,720
which obviously

692
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,799
already is happening or will start to

693
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,919
happen shortly because for the last 10

694
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,919
15 years i know at least about three

695
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,240
different companies that are using the

696
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,480
the satellite connections and upstream

697
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
connection to satellite as something

698
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,200
that is a typical wide access uh

699
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
network connection right so you can you

700
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,320
can just you know think when you will

701
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,000
hear in the news that that kind of

702
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,400
connectivity was hijacked and then

703
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
something was was operating in this

704
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,520
space

705
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,120
now obviously

706
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,640
all of that

707
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,000
is just

708
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,840
emanating the information in the

709
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,520
internet and we can think about this

710
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
from the multiple

711
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,080
multiple directions we are talking about

712
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,240
securing the transport securing the

713
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
transport means that you don't want

714
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,159
others to listen to your communication

715
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,080
and at the end of the day you also want

716
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
to have a control about what kind of

717
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,559
communication goes where right and the

718
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,559
problem with the signals is again the

719
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,279
fact that uh

720
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,440
a lot of devices essentially all of the

721
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,039
devices are right now sending a lot of

722
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,880
telemetry uh

723
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,960
in the into the internet to some of the

724
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,440
services and it's uh pretty

725
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
popular to deploy solutions like buy

726
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,919
hole or anything like that just to try

727
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,320
to stop all of that right you cannot do

728
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,960
this uh anymore if you block some of the

729
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
critical services your devices or

730
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,200
software will simply stop to operate or

731
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,919
will operate in a kind of you know uh

732
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,159
problematic manner with regards to your

733
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,400
full full feature set but at the end of

734
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,640
the day this is nothing new right first

735
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,600
of all we had already situations when we

736
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,159
were deploying new protocols like ipv6

737
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,320
some of you were not deploying the ipv6

738
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
but the operating system defaults change

739
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,919
and suddenly your device was

740
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,320
automatically trying to set up ipv6

741
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,520
communication

742
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,320
so we did set up a lot of again best

743
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,480
practice scenarios and and thought about

744
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,559
how we can

745
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,039
how we can train how we can inform

746
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,600
customers and then users uh how to

747
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,399
operate this technology securely right

748
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,559
it's a bit of different discussion if

749
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,720
you are dealing with end user devices

750
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,480
it's a bit the different discussion if

751
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,799
you are dealing with uh devices and

752
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,720
software that should be operated by the

753
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
integrators or companies that are

754
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,760
actually

755
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,360
professionally doing that kind of

756
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,440
deployments but at the end of the day

757
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,880
it's about the

758
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,039
user or the owner of the address space

759
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,880
and the service to make sure that

760
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,600
whatever he or she is doing will be

761
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,520
will be done in a most secure manner

762
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,840
right and one of the best practice uh

763
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,000
services that we did deploy on our in

764
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,480
this this example i did deploy was the

765
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,799
copy of the isl 1110 112 sorry

766
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,200
autonomous system which is a curiosity

767
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,559
by its own because in poland if you know

768
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,080
we have a

769
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,720
number 112 and this is emergency number

770
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,120
and there is no connection between those

771
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,440
two that was established way way uh

772
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,080
before and the thinking here is that uh

773
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
because your root servers or your

774
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,960
forwarding servers dns servers will be

775
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,760
uh

776
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,880
likely

777
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,279
sending some reverse queries towards the

778
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,559
root servers

779
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,799
and if the root or reverse query is

780
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,880
about private others ipr space it

781
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,399
doesn't make any sense to actually send

782
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,880
it anywhere because it cannot be cannot

783
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,799
be answered you should be trying to keep

784
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,320
this traffic locker right you shouldn't

785
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,000
be sending this to the towards the

786
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,159
internet unfortunately in most of the

787
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,000
cases the default configurations from

788
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,080
most of the microsoft based systems for

789
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,120
example do that and this is potentially

790
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,640
also one of the

791
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
uh interesting uh

792
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,720
information gathering exercises when you

793
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
can enter in intercept that kind of

794
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,200
communication and see what kind of

795
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,520
queries are being searched for for this

796
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,080
company or by this company but by dns

797
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,039
servers of this company uh dns for the

798
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,960
last couple of years became a very

799
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,360
interesting intelligence gathering um

800
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,919
protocol so right now we are also trying

801
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,720
to do something on a community-based

802
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,279
basis to to actually stop it first of

803
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,919
all and obviously also to

804
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,559
contain to some extent the number of

805
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,640
queries that are being targeted to the

806
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,880
to the root servers right essentially

807
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,919
is112 is any casted service run by the

808
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,279
volunteers and you can think about this

809
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,039
service as a kind of sinkhole right we

810
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,960
are not responding to the queries we are

811
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
just uh

812
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,880
advertising the address space and try to

813
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,600
to

814
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,799
contain this fluid of fluid of packets

815
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,720
and this is the statistics from the the

816
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,039
servers i'm running there is a instance

817
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,399
for is one one ten one and two sorry and

818
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,559
established a long time ago by applying

819
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,880
folks and a shout out to them with

820
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
regards to running the service

821
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
i did set up four instances and i would

822
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
like to thank admon and epics for

823
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,480
providing the free ecolocation

824
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,720
facilities to doing so but anyway you

825
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,120
can see that there is a lot of queries

826
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,159
uh happening in a normal day in some of

827
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,919
the cases when we see

828
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,480
some some additional traffic for example

829
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
during the attacks or ddos attacks stuff

830
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,840
like that the amount of traffic being

831
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,880
being

832
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,960
sent towards those servers is a bit

833
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,039
bigger but typically they don't cross

834
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,080
about to 250 queries per second each and

835
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,559
every server out of the four right so

836
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,440
you can see something about the scale

837
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
and this is just a capture

838
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,840
from from august 15 when i was observing

839
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
what is going on on one of those servers

840
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,080
so you can see an example of some of the

841
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
requests that are coming from

842
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,360
potentially also your address space

843
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,519
right so watch out for that because

844
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,200
obviously at the end of the day

845
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,360
there is no easy way i could potentially

846
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,840
use this information but i know this is

847
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,880
not a

848
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
best practice right sending the

849
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,200
information about your internal queries

850
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,799
to the internet

851
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,799
just because your dns servers are

852
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,679
misconfigured right and potentially you

853
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,200
could start to map in

854
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,880
internal address space obviously this

855
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,600
will be time consuming and likely just

856
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,960
attacking the application would be

857
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,399
faster but anyway

858
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,720
this is considered a bad practice in

859
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,039
some of the cases you can see two places

860
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,039
here when i did use

861
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,480
blue blocking

862
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,720
square this is the situation when the

863
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,000
name of the

864
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,399
request is actually coming out somebody

865
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,480
is looking for a very specific

866
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,720
company-like name

867
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,120
that again shouldn't uh likely hit

868
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,200
anything outside of your internal

869
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,159
network and uh you know us service

870
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,360
providers are doing that kind of

871
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,919
exercises from time to time and again

872
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,760
kudos to them but they are you know

873
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,919
willing to to spend time on stuff like

874
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,960
that but i will be also trying to uh

875
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,440
reach slowly to some of the companies

876
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,039
with the example of the of the

877
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,960
communication asking them to you know

878
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,640
implement the best practices along with

879
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,440
the short links to how to do that on a

880
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,279
different dns servers

881
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,080
and i'm happy to say that in most of the

882
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
open source servers like unbound for

883
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,440
example that kind of result that kind of

884
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,919
requests are handled internally and they

885
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,519
are not forwarded by default to the

886
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,679
internet so in most of the cases unless

887
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,760
you did misconfigure something seriously

888
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,519
wrong

889
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,600
you should be you should be fine and you

890
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,360
shouldn't be worried about the telemetry

891
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,039
coming from your network

892
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,480
now

893
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,559
the last thing i would want to tackle is

894
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,880
this dark communication that we discuss

895
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,279
initially with adam and this is the new

896
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,799
trend that uh

897
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,120
is actually you know spending most of

898
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,039
the time of folks dealing with network

899
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,240
security for or taking most of the time

900
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,000
for for folks dealing with network

901
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
security during the last i would say

902
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,480
decade in terms of uh how we we should

903
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,559
tackle that the problem is that uh

904
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,799
obviously old version of ssl or

905
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,919
essentially all versions of ssl and the

906
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,000
old versions of tls were already

907
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,799
depreciated but if you look into your

908
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,360
traffic first of all the some of your

909
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,760
devices and services will still use it

910
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
which is unsafe

911
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,039
second of all

912
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,519
your malware or your malware malware

913
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,120
that is attacking you or operating

914
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,039
within your address space or

915
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,200
trying to horizontally spread across

916
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,440
your entire infrastructure is likely

917
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,519
also using encryption why because if you

918
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,760
are using encryption there is a

919
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,080
additional cost of decrypting the

920
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,240
traffic and then inspecting it in some

921
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,919
of the cases you simply cannot decrypt

922
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,279
the traffic because you don't have the

923
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,640
any keys right uh to to do so so there

924
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,320
are a couple of strategies here i don't

925
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,640
want to go into into details how to deal

926
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
with that in terms of you know defining

927
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,120
a strategy or defining a policy just

928
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,279
wanted to make couple of points and then

929
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,279
offer some some guidance right so first

930
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,320
of all

931
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,120
a lot of devices will use depreciated

932
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,200
tls versions and this is as i said

933
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,320
unsafe

934
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,560
and what's funny is that a lot of

935
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,399
different devices that can be connected

936
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,440
over wi-fi uh

937
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,639
surprisingly are also using tls for

938
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,800
communication i haven't seen recently

939
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,839
anything using ssl but some of the uh

940
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,000
for example philips beamers are using

941
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,399
tls 1.0 to contact

942
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,879
the the mothership right

943
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,399
which is interesting because if you can

944
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,000
intercept that kind of communication it

945
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,918
happens over wi-fi so it happens over

946
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,040
radio you can do likely some interesting

947
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,399
stuff this is not my domain of of work

948
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,040
but that kind of protocols can be easily

949
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,918
attacked they are vulnerable to a lot of

950
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,159
different interesting interesting

951
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,320
attacks with regards to the logic behind

952
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,918
how the sessions are established and how

953
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,000
the ciphers are being

954
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,119
negotiated and then you can likely just

955
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,640
you know be the mothership for this

956
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,960
phillips beamer and then start to do

957
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,480
funny things during the corporate

958
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,640
presentations the same happens with the

959
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,880
equipment we are using at home right

960
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
some of the samsung tvs and this is for

961
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,960
example not the the only of course the

962
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,359
vendor that has that kind of problems

963
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,359
but uh what's interesting at least for

964
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,599
me is those are the tvs that were both

965
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,079
like a year ago this is not a tv that

966
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,720
was both ten years ago and uh it has the

967
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
first internet connectivity ethernet

968
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,880
jack or something like that no no no

969
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,599
those are pretty pretty new tvs with uh

970
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,839
upgraded firmware and stuff like that

971
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,359
and sometimes those

972
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,119
sorry those devices will be talking

973
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,079
using depreciated

974
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,480
standards so watch out for that because

975
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,240
obviously you can be owned in a number

976
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,400
of ways um almost like unlimited numbers

977
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,480
of ways one of the things is just you

978
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,880
know entering your whole network or your

979
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,599
uh

980
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,599
branch network and then

981
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,440
propagating laterally

982
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,400
within that infrastructure jumping to

983
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,040
more and more important

984
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,960
devices across your network and the

985
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,200
funny thing is uh

986
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,359
we are going through the way that we

987
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,160
were already in right because initially

988
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,960
when we were talking about my endpoint

989
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,280
will connect to your service we were not

990
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,200
encrypting the traffic at all

991
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,079
then we decided okay this becomes a

992
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,240
really bad word for the clear text

993
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,079
communication let's try to encrypt the

994
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,680
traffic and authenticate the traffic

995
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,720
right

996
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,520
then

997
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,079
obviously the the vendors like cisco for

998
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,640
example i'm working for came saying that

999
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,520
folks this is uh the network as it is

1000
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,079
can bring some important services to the

1001
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,400
traffic that you are you are sending

1002
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,240
so let's inspect this in a kind of

1003
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,160
man-in-the-middle type of uh

1004
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,880
interception and then do all kind of

1005
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,800
policy stuff right let's apply firewall

1006
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,960
policy let's apply ips policy let's

1007
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,119
apply anti-malware stuff like that and

1008
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,359
this is actually the situation where

1009
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,599
right now because at some point in time

1010
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,760
it was decided okay let's push all of

1011
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,839
the traffic through those middle boxes

1012
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,320
because they will provide us with some

1013
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,240
some specific policy enforcement

1014
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,160
capabilities but the problem is

1015
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,280
obviously right now with tls 1.3 that in

1016
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,119
some cases when you are doing things

1017
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,359
like certificate pinning and stuff like

1018
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,800
that there is

1019
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,880
it is no longer possible if the end

1020
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
point is properly managed to do that

1021
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,800
kind of interception and more and more

1022
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,119
applications are actually embedding the

1023
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,880
certificates and um enforcing mutual

1024
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,119
authentication of the sessions right so

1025
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,760
the problem is becoming that the the

1026
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,480
problem is starting to

1027
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,480
to be the fact that you cannot actually

1028
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,320
rely on the middle box to inspect the

1029
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,800
traffic because in some of the cases

1030
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,880
the the application will be truly

1031
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,119
end-to-end encrypted and you can break

1032
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,760
this but you cannot intercept this in

1033
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,480
any meaningful way the problem here is

1034
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,320
that in some of the cases you have to

1035
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,240
write in some of the places where you

1036
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,920
are working like a banking sector or

1037
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,720
energy sector any kind of interest in

1038
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,800
sorry critical infrastructure you will

1039
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,040
be looking for ways to enforce some

1040
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,000
specific traffic policy uh scenarios and

1041
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
in such cases that kind of connections

1042
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,560
has to be downgraded or

1043
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,720
by managing the certificate centrally

1044
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,280
and controlling who can access what uh

1045
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,359
they will be essentially kind of you

1046
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,480
know downgrading the overall uh security

1047
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,400
posture from end-to-end encryption to

1048
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,240
end to middle box to

1049
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,960
uh and service point encryption but if

1050
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,680
you look from the the problem from the

1051
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,200
from the last i would say 20 25 years of

1052
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,359
time you can see that essentially we

1053
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,000
bounced around right we moved some of

1054
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,880
the

1055
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
some of the effort to the end point then

1056
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,560
we moved some of the effort to network

1057
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,800
to scale the effort because obviously we

1058
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,760
moved from one megabit to 10 megabits to

1059
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,640
100 megabits then to 1 gigs of traffic

1060
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,320
right now we are talking about 10

1061
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,160
gigabytes of traffic 40 gigabits of

1062
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,440
traffic 100 gigabits of traffic and in

1063
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,079
some cases 400 or 800 gigabits of

1064
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,839
traffic right which is kind of

1065
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,079
problematic for to handle even for a

1066
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,720
network dedicated accelerators so this

1067
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,480
is the situation where we're in we are

1068
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
bouncing between the middle boxes doing

1069
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,119
stuff and endpoints doing stuff right

1070
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,839
now in 2021 it seems that the end point

1071
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,240
is is the focus point this is where the

1072
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
session starts and in some of the

1073
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,160
some of the situations it will be the

1074
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,079
session it will be the place where

1075
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,720
actually we only have the the the only

1076
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,560
place where we have full visibility in

1077
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,640
what is going on on the process side and

1078
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,160
that is generating the traffic the

1079
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,000
network itself before or the network

1080
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,760
traffic itself because before it is

1081
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,800
encrypted and then when it's uh sent

1082
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,119
over to the to the service so it has to

1083
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,760
be acted upon right uh there are a

1084
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,160
couple of interesting proposals how to

1085
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,040
offload the the encryption to the

1086
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,200
network or to some kind of accelerator

1087
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,920
or to some kind of function that will be

1088
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,160
allowed to intercept the traffic or

1089
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,880
inspect the traffic but again if we are

1090
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,000
thinking about privacy

1091
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
that's almost like an end goal right you

1092
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
don't want any middle box to intercept

1093
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
your traffic if we are thinking about

1094
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,079
enforcing the traffic in the enterprise

1095
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,760
that's kind of nightmare scenario right

1096
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
because at some point in time you can

1097
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,839
become blind and this is exactly what i

1098
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,000
what i thought about when i said dark

1099
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,680
networks right

1100
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,520
first of all the middle boxes obviously

1101
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,680
can be attacked as well there is a great

1102
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,960
recent

1103
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,760
study done by folks from from university

1104
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,520
of maryland and boulder

1105
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,920
that actually shows that some of the dpi

1106
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,319
ips and loadable answers can be actually

1107
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,079
attacked and they can be used to

1108
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,800
amplificate or to to reflect uh

1109
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,040
amplificator attacks as well right which

1110
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,240
is a

1111
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,720
scary story by though by its own right

1112
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,040
but it's kind of obvious for any anybody

1113
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,560
that is dealing with security that if

1114
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,000
something is doing something with the

1115
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
traffic likely it's also an attack

1116
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,960
vector at the same time if you are uh if

1117
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,880
you are good enough to try to to attack

1118
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,280
it the other problem

1119
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,040
sorry for that because it seems

1120
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,400
something is wrong with the with the

1121
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,200
switching the other problem is that uh

1122
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
unfortunately immediately after the

1123
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
problem was identified that we have a

1124
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,040
lot of encrypted traffic

1125
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,920
and we cannot deal with that at scale

1126
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,839
malware started to use encrypted traffic

1127
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,319
right one of the interesting ideas was

1128
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,119
to try to then apply some fingerprinting

1129
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,520
on the encrypted traffic and say okay

1130
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,160
this also we cannot decrypt the traffic

1131
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,720
but we can fingerprint it and once we

1132
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,560
did fingerprint the traffic or the

1133
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,160
initial setup of the session we can say

1134
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,800
with pretty high confidence that

1135
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
actually this is a malware right because

1136
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,000
it looks like a specific strain of uh

1137
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,839
some malware that was used in an attack

1138
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,599
that we know already about and it was

1139
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,400
also using for example tls 1.1 or

1140
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,920
whatever else right

1141
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,200
so

1142
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,440
the there is a interesting

1143
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,040
development therefore there was an

1144
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,960
interesting development effort done by

1145
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,040
the engineering team at salesforce they

1146
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,119
built a

1147
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,880
j3j3s for the server side of of the

1148
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,599
library part they built an interesting

1149
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,200
library that is actually doing the

1150
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,920
fingerprinting on the fly they even did

1151
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
publish online the fingerprinting

1152
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,599
database because again the data is

1153
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,599
usually the most important or

1154
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,760
stuff that we can offer but

1155
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,359
unfortunately if you are just using

1156
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,079
single single metric to measure if this

1157
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,560
is a malware or not you may be easily

1158
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,400
misled this is just an example of that

1159
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,560
and the quality of the data that you are

1160
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,359
gathering in the databases will be very

1161
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,599
very important right as you can see this

1162
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,720
is a online test done yesterday on this

1163
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,040
site with the fingerprint but this is uh

1164
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,960
i was using the brave browser right you

1165
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,440
can see that the fingerprint was

1166
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,880
identified as a firefox across different

1167
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
operating systems again none of which

1168
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,720
matches what i was using at the time

1169
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,680
which was a mac os so unfortunately the

1170
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,720
only

1171
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,480
only doing

1172
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,480
fingerprinting using single

1173
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,680
set of data may not be enough that's why

1174
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,760
for example at cisco and some other

1175
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,000
vendors are obviously doing this as well

1176
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,160
we not only do the fingerprinting of the

1177
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,480
traffic we also do analyze some of the

1178
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,200
behavioral data and then we match the

1179
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,280
traffic for other services with other

1180
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,520
services like for example our dns

1181
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,119
intelligence solution which is cisco

1182
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,000
umbrella and this gives us much better

1183
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,720
information about okay seems like this

1184
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,280
is a host that is using uh encrypted

1185
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,119
connection and on the first side it

1186
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,359
would look like it's a malware but

1187
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,280
actually if we correlate all kind of

1188
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,599
different um data we have all kind of

1189
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,200
different metrics that we have about the

1190
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,440
traffic doesn't seem so right it looks

1191
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,119
like almost like a malware but at the

1192
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,040
end of the day it seems that it's just a

1193
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
for example a point of sale

1194
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,119
application behaving in a kind of

1195
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,079
unusual but still controllable uh

1196
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,880
controllable way and this is the example

1197
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,040
of the open source so obviously you

1198
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,119
don't need to use uh at this moment

1199
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,640
cisco solution but at the end of the day

1200
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,720
you can play with that kind of things

1201
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,520
and we as cisco also published two open

1202
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,319
source projects first one was joy

1203
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,040
in 2018 i believe right now recently we

1204
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,680
also released mercury and those are the

1205
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,680
parts of the story right so if you want

1206
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,640
to do a collection at scale you have to

1207
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,800
do this in the access and that's why we

1208
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,040
are using our switches access points and

1209
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,680
routers to actually collect uh some of

1210
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,599
the data and the same data you can

1211
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,079
collect yourself by using joy or mercury

1212
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,520
right this is just an example from

1213
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,920
mercury package when we are generating

1214
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,000
those fingerprints from the from the

1215
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
encrypted traffic obviously you have to

1216
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,599
have the back end that will store this

1217
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,839
data and then analyze this data using

1218
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,079
any kind of machine learning or unicorn

1219
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,560
specific uh artificial intelligence that

1220
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,240
adam was referring to at the beginning

1221
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,319
of the session but still it's a it's a

1222
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,720
good start right at least you can see

1223
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,240
what kind of traffic goes through

1224
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,920
through your network and start analyzing

1225
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,240
this uh later on there are a couple of

1226
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,800
interesting industry examples of

1227
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,960
of trying to deal with the with the

1228
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,880
problem now

1229
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,800
this is just a show

1230
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,520
this is just just a picture of

1231
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,040
information

1232
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,760
or correlation advantage that you get

1233
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,280
when you start to correlate different

1234
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,240
sources of information http headers dns

1235
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,760
intelligence and at the end of the day

1236
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,520
everything together along with the tls

1237
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,599
fingerprint and you can come up with

1238
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,839
with pretty interesting confidence like

1239
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,440
99.8 percent typically when you read

1240
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,599
through the white papers available all

1241
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,440
around and this is just a selection of

1242
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,800
them again you will have links in the

1243
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
pdf file you will see that the

1244
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,400
confidence grows

1245
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,319
if you are using multiple sources of

1246
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,160
information at the same time

1247
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,480
if the outer of the white purple is just

1248
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,119
using a single metric or set of metrics

1249
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,599
on a given traffic uh when the traffic

1250
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,880
data set is changing usually the the the

1251
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,680
confidence uh again goes back to like 50

1252
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,160
60 percent which is almost like you know

1253
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,640
usable from from any kind of uh

1254
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,960
practical uh things

1255
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,599
so in summary uh

1256
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,920
where are where are we going and

1257
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,400
what are we looking forward to so first

1258
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,520
of all

1259
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,200
uh right now it seems that we are

1260
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,359
fighting a big battle about privacy and

1261
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,760
obviously tls encryption and searching

1262
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,520
for malware and tls encryption will be

1263
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,800
part of it

1264
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,960
as you've heard recently in the news

1265
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,800
april decided to roll out actually they

1266
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,960
did roll out this years ago but we

1267
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,800
didn't know that but right now they

1268
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,599
wanted to implement this full scale

1269
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,560
they stopped this effort because the the

1270
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,400
both the cryptologic

1271
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,319
community and some of the folks that are

1272
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,480
pretty active in the space started to

1273
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,319
ask hard questions how the information

1274
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,839
will be used but this is a kind of

1275
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,160
problematic in terms of living in a

1276
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,240
country when that kind of hush can

1277
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,960
actually decide if if you will be in

1278
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,400
prison or not

1279
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,319
and

1280
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,640
we are working in internet space right

1281
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,560
we consider ourselves

1282
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,480
folks that are building the internet

1283
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,800
solutions so if there is something that

1284
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,359
we cannot really solve we should just

1285
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,560
try harder

1286
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
and look for other ways to achieve the

1287
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,160
same right the same

1288
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,680
and this is exactly what is happening

1289
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,359
right now in both of the topics i was

1290
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,720
talking about so

1291
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,280
one was transparent uh transport

1292
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,599
security when we need to find the ways

1293
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,160
to actually validate who is advertising

1294
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,599
the address space and

1295
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,160
from where they are advertising this and

1296
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,960
also looking for uh signs of malware in

1297
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,200
the encrypted traffic and to be scalable

1298
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,760
we cannot really rely on being able to

1299
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,480
decrypt everything right it will be more

1300
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,160
uh or it will be less and less actually

1301
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,240
feasible going forward because the

1302
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,319
encryption will grow stronger and at the

1303
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,559
end of the day some of their companies

1304
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,079
are already experimenting with their

1305
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,480
proprietary encryption and big content

1306
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,240
providers i will not name names right

1307
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,240
now but you can think about who is

1308
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,839
trying to control your smartphone if

1309
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,280
this is not just a vendor of the

1310
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,319
smartphone

1311
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,200
so

1312
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
we should be looking to implement uh

1313
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,359
stuff that is already known and that's

1314
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,520
one kind of key problem because in most

1315
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,680
of the cases that kind of best practices

1316
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,920
are not implemented and then we should

1317
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,040
try to follow the the the

1318
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,319
principle of uh of least uh privileges

1319
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,119
right

1320
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,040
uh some folks call it zero trust

1321
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,440
architecture when you simply uh assume

1322
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
that there is no communication alone

1323
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,720
until you

1324
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,559
are able to to

1325
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,800
define a policy then use

1326
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,720
multi-factor authentication or strong

1327
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,800
authentication to authenticate all kind

1328
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,079
of sessions

1329
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,839
but at the same time things that did

1330
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,920
work for 20 years and are still working

1331
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,400
today things like layered defense and

1332
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,079
deploying that kind of services should

1333
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:52,800
be

1334
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,240
should be uh

1335
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,319
you know on top of your list of things

1336
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,319
that i need to implement immediately my

1337
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,720
network to avoid being owned by

1338
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,640
ransomware or simply being known by

1339
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,359
somebody out there in the internet and

1340
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,599
last but not least there is a growing

1341
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,760
amount of publications about polish

1342
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,839
internet and the security space within

1343
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,559
the security space so i i encourage you

1344
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,400
to look through those

1345
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,319
and read through them because they all

1346
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,839
often contain a

1347
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,680
number of important or at least

1348
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,520
interesting information

1349
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,960
at the end of a typical vendor

1350
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,640
presentation you will see a lot of white

1351
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,480
papers sponsored by the vendor so i'm

1352
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,800
not going to do that right now but i

1353
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,200
would like to ask you uh to go through

1354
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,800
those reports and see what is happening

1355
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,720
in the polish internet and just you know

1356
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
subscribe to whatever is happening in

1357
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,960
this space to be aware of uh

1358
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,200
what is happening in the space right

1359
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,280
and with that thank you very much sorry

1360
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,359
for keeping it a bit longer than than it

1361
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,680
was planned i hope that was at least

1362
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,880
interesting

1363
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,160
uh opening uh session for stuff related

1364
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,359
