00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,880
that conference and i really like it uh

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,160
that's the first time i'm doing it

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,640
remotely and not actually in poland but

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,400
i hope that next year

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,039
um it will happen in poland again

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
so thank you for uh for joining me

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,640
uh to my presentation

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
and i would like to uh

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,280
say a little bit more about myself so

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
i've been dealing with the hacking as a

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,079
pen tester security researcher and a

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,719
hacker for many years

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,120
i saw a lot of organizations from the

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,839
inside

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
and while doing penetration testing i

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,039
saw vulnerabilities and issues either

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,039
with the companies themselves or with

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,920
certain

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
cyber security tools that they're using

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,600
um

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,360
in addition to that i have multiple

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,680
certifications one of them is cso which

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,439
is chief information security officer

26
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,840
from the israeli institute of technology

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,439
and multiple other

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,560
cyber security certifications

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,240
speaking in different conferences i

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,040
really like to share knowledge about

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,600
new things

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
in cyber in hacking

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
i have multiple zero days and exploits

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,479
that i found and wrote in the past i'm

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,000
really hands on

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
uh even though i'm i'm building my own

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,439
company now

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,040
and the last part is actually i'm an

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,520
entrepreneur i have my second startup

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,640
right now

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,159
and i think that

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,079
that really helped me

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,479
get the relevant information

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,640
for uh for those slides that i'm going

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
to share with you because i had the

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,520
angle of the hacker i had the angle of

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
the penetration tester

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,680
and now i have the angle of talking with

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
the with security managers and venture

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,439
capitals vcs uh which are the people

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,920
that actually fund those cyber security

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,318
companies from the start so i think with

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,800
all that knowledge together

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
i was able to build that presentation

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,400
and share uh share it with you guys

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,319
so what are we going to talk about um

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,160
basically i have four interesting cases

58
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,920
real life cases from the last years so

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,560
not like three five ten years ago it's

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
actually happening right now those

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
vendors are actually active right now

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,519
and i'm gonna share with you four cases

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,800
about things about bad things that cyber

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,959
security vendors those are the companies

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,440
that actually sell security products you

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,160
know

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
firewalls ids's

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,879
endpoint protection whatever

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,080
um

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
and they're kind of cheating the

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,400
customers so i've met too many slicky

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,440
sales people that uh try to fool those

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
cso the chief information security

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,879
officers that actually

75
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
needs to buy those solutions

76
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,080
i found

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
a lot of non-working cyber solutions

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,200
either by getting

79
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
by testing them

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,159
or by

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,720
inside information that i got from those

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,519
companies uh of course i got it in in a

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,599
legal way i'm not sure about those who

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,560
who are giving that information to me

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,519
um

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,400
and i want to share it to stop uh stop

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,200
those

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,599
you know behaviors stop that way of

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,920
thinking that cyber security vendors

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,239
could fool customers

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,319
uh and on the other side from a hacker's

92
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,080
perspective i would say

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,760
you know if there is a really crappy

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
cyber security product it should get

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
hacked

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
it should get bypassed and the

97
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
information should uh should be revealed

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,920
and shared with the community

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,599
to to

100
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,400
cut that fluff

101
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
so the first uh first case actually

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,200
um that was uh while i was doing a

103
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,840
project in a large cyber security

104
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
company and when i'm saying large it

105
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
means they are top-notch uh in their

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
industry they have hundreds of uh

107
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,759
employees working for them a huge

108
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,918
development team huge cyber security

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,720
team

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
uh so it's not like a small startup

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
trying to build itself it's a huge

112
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,759
company

113
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,440
now

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,919
there was one customer uh

115
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,840
that was sending the feedback that some

116
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,120
features are not working so he tested

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,160
specific features and he was able to

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,280
bypass

119
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,600
the solution like they were never there

120
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,520
and he contacted the company

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,479
and they followed it to me as a project

122
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,280
and i started looking at the company

123
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,199
source code they gave me the source code

124
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,320
i was there their offices looking at it

125
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
and i was reading the code and i know to

126
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,479
read and write in multiple languages but

127
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,120
there was one specific function that i

128
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,320
couldn't understand i couldn't

129
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
understand the purpose of that specific

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,880
function what does it do

131
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
and then after two or three days looking

132
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
at it i approached the development team

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and i told them you know do you know who

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,680
wrote that specific

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,960
function

136
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
um

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,000
and they they looked for that and there

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,479
was a one of the their uh

139
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,560
senior guy and he said i wrote it you

140
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
know like two years ago

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,960
uh and nobody was complaining about it

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,320
i'm not sure what what do you want to do

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,759
with that function

144
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,600
and then there was something something

145
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
something equals three in that function

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
and i couldn't understand what was that

147
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
three in there and i asked him why did

148
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,759
he place three in that function

149
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,639
and he he told me i need to you know

150
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,560
think about it and the next day he

151
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,320
approached me and he told me

152
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,759
i don't know

153
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,400
why

154
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,720
uh we have three in there but you're the

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
cyber expert you know we can put any

156
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
other number we can put five we can put

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,560
10

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
we could put 50.

159
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,600
so the thing is they are selling a

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
product

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
uh they don't know what's going on in

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
their code

163
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
uh even the guy that wrote that function

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
doesn't know what's going on that's

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
that's the function that didn't work

166
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,319
for the customer so he was when he was

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,720
actually testing the product he was able

168
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,600
to

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,919
bypass it with um

170
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,520
with exploits because that function

171
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
didn't work because nobody knew what was

172
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,560
that three

173
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,160
and just to

174
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
understand the average deal size of

175
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
those products are five to six million

176
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,680
dollars per installation so you're

177
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,840
selling something to your customer the

178
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,240
guy that actually wrote that specific

179
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
function in that specific cyber part uh

180
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,960
in the product does not know uh

181
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,120
what is that number there uh the

182
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,039
function is not working and he's asking

183
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,400
me he's telling me well you're the

184
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,560
expert just give me another number so

185
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,479
nobody was thinking that that entire

186
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,400
thing is not working

187
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,960
so that's that's the first case of of uh

188
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
that's the easiest case i'm gonna go

189
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,520
from easy to hard but that's uh just

190
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
shows that we have a cyber security

191
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,919
vendor that sells average deal size of

192
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,000
million dollars per deal

193
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,160
it's not working they don't know what's

194
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
working they don't want to fix it uh

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,479
they're just wanna want someone to give

196
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,400
them another number which is crazy

197
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,160
okay next case

198
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,919
next case i was actually approaching um

199
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,560
a bank because i'm currently currently

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,440
founded uh cyriact uh in the past i

201
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,120
founded another cyber security company

202
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
called phenor7 that was a lateral

203
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,440
movement detection uh cyber security

204
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
company

205
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
and i was approaching potential

206
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,039
customers some of them are security

207
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
managers of banks

208
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,840
so

209
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,160
this uh cso

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,759
guy this chief information security

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,360
officer that met me

212
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
showed me a tool that they're using um

213
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,240
and he told me uh the sentence that that

214
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
drive me a little bit crazy he told me

215
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
the solution gui is really nice it must

216
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
be a great product

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,120
so what he's saying is that if the gui

218
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,240
of that cyber security product is nice

219
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,639
that means that that product is working

220
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
perfectly fine and it must be a good

221
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,319
product

222
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,240
now when i looked at that product

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
i saw i was able to look at the source

224
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
code of that product that product

225
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,639
specifically was also million dollars

226
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,320
per deal of uh

227
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
uh of a sale

228
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,839
i saw that

229
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,760
either everything or most of the things

230
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,679
are actually hard coded

231
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,640
so

232
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,880
the cool gui that he says with all the

233
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,760
statistics and numbers

234
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,640
and

235
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,200
so-called alerts everything was actually

236
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,920
hard coded in the product that product

237
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,440
was not doing

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,560
anything

239
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
so that was a total fake gui

240
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,000
that i agree i looked at the gui it's

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,320
nice from a design perspective

242
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
but everything was hard coded in that

243
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
solution so that cso of that bank thinks

244
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
that that solution protects him and

245
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,200
helps him and because it has a nice gui

246
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,920
it's fine but the reality is everything

247
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,399
is hardcoded inside so nothing happens

248
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
in that solution now it happens to be

249
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,680
that because i was raising funds to my

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,279
previous startup

251
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,760
i met with a lot of venture capitals

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,839
and it happens to be that i met that

253
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
specific venture capital that invested

254
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,440
in that tool they invested initially

255
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
five million dollars

256
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,279
uh in that tool that was years ago and

257
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,040
then they invested some more and then

258
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,880
other vcs joined them so there was a lot

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,959
of money being invested

260
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,560
uh in that solution

261
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,440
and the vc told me uh he told me you

262
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
know just between us and again i'm not

263
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
going to reveal the vc name or the tool

264
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,800
name so that's fine just between us

265
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,920
we know

266
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,760
as a venture capital that there is

267
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,320
nothing behind but we trust the team

268
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,480
that they will build it

269
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,279
so

270
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,040
that's totally crazy

271
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,680
those people that company they took all

272
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,120
the money that was invested spend it on

273
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
really nice gui i agree it was really

274
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,240
nice

275
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,959
build nothing behind that tool spend

276
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
some money on marketing and sales and

277
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,440
they're selling that tool to banks and

278
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,279
banks thinks that they're protected by

279
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,320
that tool everybody knows so the team

280
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
knows that there's everything hard coded

281
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,800
because they wrote it the guy behind you

282
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,480
know the venture capital that actually

283
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
funded it in millions of dollars they

284
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
know that there's nothing behind it and

285
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
they don't care they just sell it to

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,560
banks that some banks can't really test

287
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
it properly they think that the gui is

288
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,560
nice so it's working and that's what

289
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,000
happened and then you can hear about

290
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,560
banks being hacked uh and then the cso

291
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,320
said well we bought all the security

292
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,560
tools needed yes you bought they needed

293
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
tools but they're not working there's

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
nothing there you just bought a nice gui

295
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,399
so that's

296
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,120
that's the second case

297
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,640
a third case that's actually uh

298
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,760
going up in the scale

299
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,240
so this is also a well funded company

300
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,279
and what happens there is that they are

301
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,279
doing um

302
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,839
cyber security analytics on your

303
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,079
internal network

304
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,800
uh which means that they have their own

305
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
appliance of either a physical or

306
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,519
virtual appliance that the customer

307
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,480
needs to install within their network

308
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,040
let's say it's a an insurance company

309
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,079
they need to

310
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,560
either put a server in there or just

311
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,800
install a virtual machine

312
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,160
then they need to connect something

313
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,560
called port mirror which means that

314
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,360
that company's device will get a copy of

315
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
each and every packet that travels the

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,720
network

317
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,079
um of uh of that customer so get they

318
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,959
get a copy of the transfer of the um

319
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,720
the packets

320
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
they need to process the packets and

321
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
what they're promising to their

322
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,639
customers is look we have a top-notch

323
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,240
crazy ai and machine learning engine

324
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,040
that engine will know to analyze your

325
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,519
problems your cyber problems

326
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,560
and then

327
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,360
suggest a solution a potential solution

328
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,079
that you can do so for example uh you

329
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,200
know somebody is scanning your firewall

330
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
i will understand that there is a scan

331
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,279
that happens

332
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,000
and then we will suggest you to for

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
example close port one two three four

334
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,399
five just as an example and then you can

335
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,040
go ahead as the customer and execute

336
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
that specific suggestion

337
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
now what actually happened in that

338
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,680
company they haven't built any engine

339
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,440
behind the scenes what they were doing

340
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
and they are still doing this is an

341
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,040
active company

342
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,440
uh again worth millions of dollars what

343
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,079
they're doing is they're actually

344
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,519
collect the information with port mirror

345
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
they send it to the cloud

346
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,279
they have a specific guide or two guys

347
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,160
sitting there manually going through the

348
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
packets

349
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,399
understanding what happens manually

350
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,480
and then sending writing manually the

351
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,399
result and sending it back to the

352
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,839
customer

353
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,399
so the customer thinks that the the what

354
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,240
what is being synchronized with the

355
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,279
cloud

356
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,440
is things like uh licensing of the

357
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,519
product and updates and things like that

358
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,440
but what actually being synchronized

359
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,800
with the cloud

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,839
is

361
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,920
they have a team of one or two people

362
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,560
they get the information they process it

363
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,120
manually they write a solution manually

364
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,959
send it back to the customer and that's

365
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,279
how it works so as a customer you're

366
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,560
paying

367
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
again a lot of money per year

368
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
to actually

369
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,360
deal

370
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,839
with uh to actually get us a top-notch

371
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,839
cyber security engine and what you're

372
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,079
actually getting is two people

373
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
sitting somewhere going through your

374
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,399
information giving you

375
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,199
half-assed results um and that's what

376
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,880
you get from that product

377
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,839
and again nobody knows because

378
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,399
you know it seems that it's working but

379
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,320
there's no engine uh in there

380
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,519
now

381
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,880
uh another case uh and that's a really

382
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
uh crazy case

383
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
uh but before i'm going to that i have

384
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,240
another small case uh to share with you

385
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,199
guys

386
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,240
um

387
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,519
and that's

388
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,680
that's not really actively fooling the

389
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,519
customer that's more of a marketing

390
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,000
fluff but that's something that um

391
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,839
it's not in the presentation because

392
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,120
it's something that is not an actual uh

393
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,160
thing so while i had my previous company

394
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,800
fenrir 7

395
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,199
we were also processing

396
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,600
internal information for customers so we

397
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,839
had a limitation of x gigabytes per

398
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,480
second to process so we had our data

399
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720
sheets and in there we explained what

400
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
type of server or what type of solution

401
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,519
could process what type of uh

402
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,320
what are what amount of traffic so in

403
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,959
our documentation it says we can process

404
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,040
let's say just as an example

405
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,199
one gigabit per second

406
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,680
now our direct competitors

407
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,399
said in their marketing materials that

408
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,440
their machine processed 24 gigabit per

409
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,839
second which means 24 more than us 24 by

410
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,959
us

411
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,760
so

412
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
you know i gathered the team and i told

413
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,519
him look you know it can be that our

414
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,920
competitors process 24 and we process

415
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
one gigabit per second when i approach

416
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
customers they tell me look janie you

417
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,399
know your competitors are 24 times

418
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,839
faster than you

419
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,240
we're not going to buy the solution

420
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,440
so

421
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,759
we went to the code tried to upgrade it

422
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
try to change it

423
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,079
and we were able to change it to 10

424
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,079
gigabit per second but that's it we

425
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,480
couldn't get to those 24 per second we

426
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,920
could get to 10

427
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,000
after a month of working and upgrading

428
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,560
and solving bottlenecks and all that

429
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,959
and then when i spoke with one of the uh

430
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,000
vc uh vps and that competitor i met him

431
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,440
in a conference

432
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
uh he told me i asked him how come you

433
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,759
can process 24 you know we can process

434
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,759
only 10. and he said what we can't

435
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,240
process 24 and then i told him well it's

436
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
on your documentation when you're

437
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,160
selling it to customers and then he said

438
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,040
well

439
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,000
the actual physical machine

440
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,320
that we are selling to the customer

441
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,240
contains four ports uh sorry two ports

442
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,079
of 10 gigabit

443
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,560
and four ports of one gigabit

444
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,440
in total you can feed 24 gigabit per

445
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
second to our machine you can fit it we

446
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,279
can process it we can process only two

447
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,399
gigabit per second but you can feed 24.

448
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,360
so

449
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
they were actually kind of fooling the

450
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
customer to believe because that's what

451
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
the customers that i've met believe and

452
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
i also believe in that they could

453
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,040
process 24 gigabits per second

454
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,720
they can they can process two gigabit

455
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,040
per second and their machine you could

456
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,280
send the information it will get nowhere

457
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,199
but you know you have the proper

458
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,000
uh

459
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,720
proper way to send it but that's it they

460
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,559
will not process the data

461
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,679
so

462
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,199
that's another way to fool a customer

463
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,599
by kind of half line you know because

464
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,160
they do they can collect that inform

465
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,039
they can

466
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,480
get that information they can't do

467
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,640
anything with it

468
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,320
so uh we're getting to our uh last case

469
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,400
and that's a really really crazy case

470
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,919
so in one of the conferences before uh

471
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,160
corona and all that when we all met in

472
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
physical conferences

473
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,480
there was a guy approaching a booth that

474
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,080
i had there so i had a booth with my

475
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,600
team you know trying to sell our

476
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,679
solution and that guy told me uh luciani

477
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,080
i actually work at one of your

478
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,919
competitors

479
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,760
i had a really big fight with my boss

480
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,679
and i'm looking on other ventures and

481
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,120
you know can you explain me a little bit

482
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,720
about your solution

483
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
and he asked very very detailed

484
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,760
questions about very uh

485
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,799
very uh complex things that we do

486
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,640
and then i told him you know let's meet

487
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
in my office later on uh we're now in a

488
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,640
conference you know we can't

489
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
speak all day about that so let's meet

490
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,640
in my office and we met uh the next day

491
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,679
actually

492
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
and then he told me look anniv i have to

493
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,440
share uh

494
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,160
some internal information with you

495
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
i have a way to show you uh uh

496
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
to validate it so you you don't need

497
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
just to trust my word

498
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
and the thing is they

499
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,880
produce

500
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
that's an american company actually so

501
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,480
they produce a cyber security solution

502
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,080
that detects hackers within your network

503
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,320
which means that the concept that

504
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,919
they're claiming is that you know if you

505
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,440
have a firewall

506
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,039
or in

507
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,120
any other perimeter control hackers will

508
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,039
bypass it and that's fine i agree with

509
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,600
that hackers will eventually bypass it

510
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
now they're inside the network

511
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,240
uh moving inside your network so that's

512
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
the that's the time that we will detect

513
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,799
them

514
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,400
so that's their claim that's a valid

515
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,840
claim there's a lot of companies with

516
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,039
that claim

517
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,840
but

518
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
what he told me is that they always

519
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,880
succeed in their poc in their proof of

520
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,400
proof of concept

521
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,160
and just to get you in context with

522
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
those guys who doesn't uh understand how

523
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
the selling process of the cyber

524
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,200
security tool works is that you as a

525
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,919
cyber vendor approach a customer

526
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,480
and then you offer that customer uh to

527
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,880
do a poc or a proof of concept which

528
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,840
means you will install your solution

529
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,640
either for for free or for a very low

530
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,120
fee for a limited amount of time let's

531
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,600
say two weeks or a month

532
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,400
um that customer could review and use

533
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
your product and see the results in that

534
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,840
period over two weeks or a month and

535
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,480
then if he's happy with it uh if the

536
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
solution worked well

537
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
or if we got good results then the

538
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,440
customer have to buy that solution they

539
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
have to buy it if it works if you've

540
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,679
proven that it works

541
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,679
so that company always got 100 percent

542
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,360
uh success in each and every customer

543
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,480
which means

544
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,000
that they always found hackers actively

545
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,520
within their customers networks now i

546
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,919
agree with the concept uh that says that

547
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,559
every network is hackable i agree with

548
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,720
the concept that says that um

549
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,000
every network probably contains hackers

550
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
uh inside

551
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,200
um

552
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,520
and i agree that those solutions are

553
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,159
needed but what those guys did and that

554
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,640
was crazy is that their engine that was

555
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,600
actually a real solution so no fuss here

556
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,440
with with without building anything or

557
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,280
just a nice gui they have a proper

558
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,679
working solution the thing is that their

559
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,679
solution was uh

560
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,760
kind of a scoring solution which means

561
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,080
that they scored multiple things and if

562
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,280
you were out of order in that scoring

563
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,320
that will

564
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,159
generate an alert and then the customer

565
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,760
could understand that there is a hacker

566
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,280
in there

567
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,400
so

568
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,520
they had one thing that they insisted

569
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,919
while installing this proof of concept

570
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
for a month to the customer they

571
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,960
insisted

572
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,520
that they will have a remote connection

573
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,200
24 7 with access to that solution

574
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,159
and usually it's not very common because

575
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,559
with you guys that deals with cyber

576
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,400
security tools if you're a bank or

577
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
insurance company or a credit card

578
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,840
company

579
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
it's not always easy to get those

580
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,720
companies give you a full remote access

581
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
to something that is installed within

582
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,159
their network in some countries in

583
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,159
europe it's even illegal to those uh

584
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,000
banks for example to give that

585
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
connection

586
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,400
so they insisted on it in each and every

587
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,280
uh customer they even they were even

588
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,159
willing to uh uh give them a lower fee

589
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,080
if they insisted not giving them remote

590
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
connection so they did everything

591
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
possible to get a remote connection that

592
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,480
that to the

593
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,360
tool

594
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,320
installed on the customer now what they

595
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
were doing and that's how they got the

596
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,360
hundred percent

597
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,480
they were forging the results

598
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,159
to generate alerts

599
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,080
which means that when they install the

600
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,039
tool

601
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,440
if magically it happens to be that there

602
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,840
was a hacker on that specific segment

603
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,480
and the two generated alerts that's fine

604
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,600
but in 95 percent of the cases uh that

605
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,799
didn't happen

606
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,280
so what they were doing is that they had

607
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,080
a specific uh cyber expert

608
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,840
and a

609
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,679
specific uh technician assigned to each

610
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,480
and every customer and they were forging

611
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,960
results through the entire month

612
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,320
to generate

613
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,360
fake

614
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,640
attacks

615
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,080
fake things that happens in their

616
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,280
network

617
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,679
so the end result would look like they

618
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,400
found a lot of things in that customer

619
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,200
network so the customer will have to buy

620
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
the tool because in that contract when

621
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,679
you're being installed with a poc one of

622
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,679
the claims there is that if the tool is

623
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,120
actually working you have to buy the

624
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,320
solution

625
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,400
so they were actually forging

626
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
that information

627
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,679
and then

628
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,760
they had a guy forging

629
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,880
report

630
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,440
a pdf report because the end result was

631
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,360
to generate the pdf results with the

632
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,720
results

633
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,440
he was manually forging that pdf report

634
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,559
with graphs with uh uh with technical

635
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,400
details with everything

636
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,720
so just imagine we have and they're

637
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
still acting today in the market we have

638
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,200
a cyber security company these days

639
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,080
instead of helping you protecting you

640
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,000
uh securing you

641
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
what they are doing

642
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
all the time with every customer and

643
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,159
that's how they get 100 success

644
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,760
so-called success

645
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,440
is by forging

646
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,320
uh

647
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,440
incidents and forging reports for those

648
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,240
customers so again the customers are not

649
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,120
safe

650
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,080
uh with that tool they get a false sense

651
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,960
of security by using those tools

652
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,080
um

653
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,400
and that's what happens with the uh with

654
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
those uh companies and then they get

655
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,440
hacked

656
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,880
so

657
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,320
that's basically

658
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,960
it those are four cases uh about um

659
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,679
about things four or five cases about

660
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,400
things that are actually happening at

661
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,760
the moment

662
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,840
with cyber security companies

663
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,320
uh what i suggest is that um if you are

664
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,159
uh csos

665
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,919
or if you are in the security teams of

666
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,279
company you should really investigate uh

667
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,320
the tools uh that you have you should

668
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,960
probably invite a pen test to try and

669
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
bypass those tools or try to challenge

670
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
those tools to see that they're actually

671
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,600
happening and not just have a tick in

672
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,880
the box

673
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,159
by buying them

674
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,880
and on the other side if you're hackers

675
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,279
i also suggest you to to test those

676
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,320
tools so

677
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,039
you know if you're trying those tools uh

678
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,360
and you get those results i can't reveal

679
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,159
the company's names but i would be happy

680
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,840
if other hackers

681
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,000
that are not related to those tools

682
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,039
we'll try to play with them we'll try to

683
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,440
hack them and we'll publish the results

684
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,360
with the company name because i think

685
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,400
that those methods should be stopped

686
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
i don't have the power to do it at the

687
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,440
moment because i would probably if i'm

688
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,960
going to reveal the company's names i'm

689
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,840
going to get sued probably but if you

690
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,200
guys

691
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
want to challenge those tools i would be

692
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,240
happy to see uh to see you guys uh

693
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,840

694
