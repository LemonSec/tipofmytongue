1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,279
okay so today i'm going to show you guys

2
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,240
the log bit ransomware as a service uh

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,880
cnc server from inside out okay so i'm

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,160
going to reveal

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,880
a water team at the product which is i'm

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,560
also a a

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
in advisory board of the of of the

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,800
fractionality's company

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,960
so uh it's really really interesting

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,239
because it's really

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,120
uh

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,920
powerful to see how much effort money

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
they put in this kind of in this kind of

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,960
back-end

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,120
cnc backhands about the doing and

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,200
delivering their bad things

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,640
so first a little bit about my agenda

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,879
today so i'm going to introduce myself

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,760
uh then i'm going to speak about the uh

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,719
the

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,399
uh

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,280
yeah my actually my my title is here uh

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,879
slightly different but it's not silver

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,520
fresh but never mind so is i

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,319
yeah

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,159
so and then uh i'm going to show you

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,920
guys the executive summary because i by

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,400
the way this is my previous uh research

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,240
so i i was also presenting them in other

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,720
conferences so i'm going to

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,320
show you guys an executive summary then

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,159
i will go on the on the technical

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,240
analysis of the puppet itself and then

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,759
we're going to romp up with some kind of

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,960
statistics

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,119
uh and then i'm going to guys show you a

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,960
little peek about the usta platform

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,320
which is a threat intelligence platform

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,079
built by our guys at

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,000
that product and then we're going to

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,520
conclude with something

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,759
uh with uh with some best practices

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,759
and yeah i have some news at the end but

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,119
let's keep it for them okay now about

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,520
myself i'm from macedonia originally i'm

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,119
born and grew up in the small city

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,560
called dostoeva

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
currently living in working in amsterdam

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,399
uh i'm holding a lead architectural for

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,200
advanced at cisco covering uh

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
europe middle east and africa and same

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,040
time i'm also in a board of advisor at

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,200
product which is a very old

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,079
pure

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,600
let's say targeted right intelligence

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,639
company which is uh uh which is uh out

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,160
there and doing a really really great

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,599
stuff

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,640
yeah uh i started with the commodore 64.

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
yeah 2007

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,400
my first iphone hack using sim clone

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,560
that that conveyor that gone while that

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
time and that's how i end up actually

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,720
today speaking to you guys about this

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,319
kind of stuff so that's that's actually

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,840
the spark that takes to the cyber

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,280
security

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,319
uh yeah let's start so let's go for a

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,920
log bit transformer ransomware as a

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,599
service first of all

71
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,440
we all know run somewhere right i mean

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,840
we know uh that how they do it we know

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,400
why they do it we know the the benefit

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
behind a bit and stuff like that but

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
honestly when i'm thinking about the

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,480
ransomware a lot of time i'm always

77
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
thinking about how easy is to deliver

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,879
around something okay in the past when i

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,280
used to live and work in milan italy uh

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,720
i was working also for another threat

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,159
intelligence company

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,360
part of the service master of

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,440
intelligence where we were also chasing

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
and and trying to figure out and taking

85
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,480
down

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,840
our bad guys who were stealing our

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
credit card information and doing the

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,280
middle browser attack to store credit

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,879
card information and to transfer the

90
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,920
money right

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
and we know how complex is to build that

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,879
kind of attack right where you need to

93
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,480
steal the credit card information to

94
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
bypass second factor doing man in the

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,239
middle brusher attack to still steal a

96
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,480
couple of a couple of uh a couple of

97
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
dollars or a couple of euros right and

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
then ransomware came in uh and you

99
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,959
didn't need to do nothing of this right

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,640
any of these so you don't need to do any

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,239
any stuff right you just need to land

102
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,159
the encrypter or run some ransomware

103
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,159
application and then you just start

104
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,840
to encrypt the files and you are asking

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
up my money right so

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
one of the reasons why ransomware is

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,959
also very very popular it's really easy

108
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,040
easy doable i mean you don't need to

109
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,799
have multiple people to do something

110
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,280
like that if if you are a skillful bad

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
guy of course

112
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
so log bit is relatively a new

113
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,120
ransomware uh it became popular in

114
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,799
couple of months it was formerly known

115
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,680
by about like abcd rounds

116
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
and it was growing you know uh in some

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
couple of in last couple of months like

118
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
it's really so because right now we also

119
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
have a top list of the ransomware so we

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
are living on an age where we are

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,239
actually ranking which bad guys are

122
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,238
better than other bad guys right

123
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,320
so how we came up to this since the

124
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,120
server how we managed to break inside it

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
was that our team uh got contacted by

126
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,840
one of the customers they asked for uh

127
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,880
help and then yeah our team step in they

128
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,040
done the forensic they reveal the uh the

129
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,440
the compromises uh the indication of the

130
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,280
compromises the artifacts and stuff like

131
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
that and then how do we end up actually

132
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,919
on the cnc server so

133
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,199
so yeah

134
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,040
getting inside encrypting the private

135
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
case we also save the customer files

136
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,199
without paying any run somewhere and

137
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,199
with a lot of other customers not all of

138
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,680
them we we didn't have the you know the

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,080
ultimate luck to save everybody but we

140
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
saved a lot of customers which were

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,919
under that affiliate on the time of the

142
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,280
attack

143
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,039
uh yeah now i'm going to present the

144
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,039
report by the way this report is also

145
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,759
more longer and more widely explained

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,680
but i just made a shorter version for

147
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,759
the powerpoint and to be able to keep it

148
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,000
the time within uh within our

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,840
presentation today

150
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
now

151
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
speaking about executive summary

152
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,320
uh so lockpit is also is a malicious

153
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,759
program that prevents users from

154
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,320
accessing their files okay so when he's

155
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
penetrating himself he's scanning your

156
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,400
network he's checking for useful targets

157
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
he's spreading the infection he's

158
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,720
stealing and encrypting the files

159
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,479
okay so that's the main risk so he's

160
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,160
doing two things right he's stealing the

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,280
files

162
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,160
and he's encrypting them right

163
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,680
that's the main purpose of the lock bit

164
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,199
but what's this

165
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,479
what's the very interesting thing here

166
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,880
is that according to the cover

167
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,639
which is some kind of

168
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,880
ransomware or analytic platform i

169
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
actually i'm not very familiar with this

170
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,400
with this specific statistics but it was

171
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
one of our guys put it on the report

172
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,840
which was really cool it shows the log

173
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,720
bit is number three right now in a top

174
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,840
list

175
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,759
in worldwide about the ransomware attack

176
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,440
so they own a market share of 7.5

177
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
okay so again we are living on the age

178
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,440
where covert is everywhere and

179
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
ransomware is everywhere and we have a

180
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,800
top list about around somewhere and

181
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
markets

182
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,639
i hope that this will not going to end

183
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,639
up in the nasdaq so where the people can

184
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,560
buy you know stocks from these bad guys

185
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
okay that's that's the worst case

186
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,240
scenario that can happen with this with

187
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
this nightmare okay

188
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
now coming about the

189
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,479
ransomware as a service so this is

190
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,639
actually the same software as a service

191
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,400
that we use every day in our day by day

192
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,960
life okay so everything that we use from

193
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,199
the cloud based on some subscription we

194
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,319
call software as a service right so we

195
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,800
use uh youtube uh services of youtube

196
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
it's free right if we pay the five

197
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,720
dollar per month to avoid the

198
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
advertisement then we actually take some

199
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,319
kind of software as a service from the

200
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,759
from the youtube right

201
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,639
this system is similar or exactly the

202
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,280
same so what they done is actually they

203
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,800
built a sas platform with multi-tenancy

204
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
multi-tenancy auto provisioning and

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
payment system in one system in one

206
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,639
platform where they can

207
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,919
resell

208
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,360
or rent the platform for the affiliates

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
where they can take carry on where they

210
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,400
can carry on uh run somewhere attacks

211
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
so it's interesting right so they built

212
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,960
many mssp portal actually let's call

213
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,080
this way

214
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,440
for a ransomware attacks

215
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,160
uh here the affiliates the users right

216
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,000
the guys who wants to use this platform

217
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,240
to deliver around some attacks so they

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
can create a new run

219
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,759
run somewhere samples so they they have

220
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,360
a click create they're going to have a

221
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,240
unique piece of uh malware or piece of

222
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
ransomware whatever you call it we've uh

223
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,639
never seen shadow synthesis before right

224
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,400
so it's unknown chapter 56 and then they

225
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,440
can drop this uh unique shuttle fit this

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,960
is and then they can start

227
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,400
uh let's say

228
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
encrypt or in fact the victim machines

229
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
let's see how it's inside

230
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,080
so the structure itself is that uh the

231
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,720
the ransomware owners employ more people

232
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,919
affiliates to to bridge into the victims

233
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
so you okay let's put this way you don't

234
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,240
know nothing about hacking

235
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
but you came to this platform you

236
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
managed to rent them

237
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,039
the consumer as a service and then you

238
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,839
going in the underground and you rent

239
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,399
hackers to hack the companies in behalf

240
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,440
of you or you buy a hacked

241
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,839
compromise

242
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,399
endpoints to deliver you around

243
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,360
somewhere

244
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
so basically again you don't need to do

245
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,279
you don't need to have any hacking or or

246
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,320
or

247
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
penetration test or whatever we call

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,920
that you know you know knowledge to be

249
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
able to deliver this kind of attack so

250
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,959
basically you run this run somewhere as

251
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,760
a service you hire a hackers or you buy

252
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
a compromise machines and then you

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
deploy your your let's say you're on

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,480
somewhere

255
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,120
uh another thing here is that uh yeah

256
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,279
it's also they share the commission the

257
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,000
from 10 to 30 from each round some

258
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,959
payments so basically you know

259
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,200
these uh ransomware as a service owners

260
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,839
they also can give access to you for

261
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,720
free

262
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
okay so they say okay here is the

263
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519
platform for free use it wherever you're

264
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,640
going to have a victim we're going to

265
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,279
speak with between 10 and 30

266
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,680
uh margins between the for the for the

267
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,640
service that we that we deliver for you

268
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,560
and also they provide a virtual machine

269
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,800
exploits and tools and everything so

270
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,640
they prepare the

271
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,800
the guys to deliver run server attacks

272
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,160
which are not you know educated or uh

273
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,080
which don't have any knowledge about how

274
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
to do this kind of stuff

275
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
here on the on the right side you can

276
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,560
see a example of a threat actor using

277
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,880
extortion method right so they extor

278
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,279
people to to pay them ransom otherwise

279
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,640
they're going to release their files

280
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,880
how is the structure of this of this

281
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
business okay

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,760
so there is a the the affiliate panel is

283
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,040
it has a

284
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
capacities like creating building around

285
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,959
trading and building around somewhere

286
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,640
executables okay so this is really

287
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,240
really important

288
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,680
why is this important because uh

289
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,519
again you don't need to build the

290
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,279
payload itself to be able to encrypt the

291
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,720
files they're going to provide for you

292
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
so you don't need to be a smaller author

293
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,160
uh they're going to preview provide you

294
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
the decrypter program okay so you don't

295
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,279
need to deal with all these kind of

296
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,440
encryptions and and keys and stuff like

297
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,279
that they're going to provide you a

298
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,360
payment gateway for cryptocurrencies so

299
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,560
you don't need to

300
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
think about how you're going to get paid

301
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
uh

302
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,079
the system it's not going to calculate

303
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,760
the commission rates between yourself

304
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,800
and them

305
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
uh you can monitor your your lovely

306
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
victims and the statistically you can

307
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,000
see which which one is better to uh to

308
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,680
to extort or not

309
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
and of course they're going to give you

310
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
a chat functionality okay

311
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,399
uh where you can speak and where you can

312
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
interact with your with your victims

313
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,640
uh here as you can see uh on the right

314
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
side this is a text taken from the from

315
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,760
the actual victim right so they give

316
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
them for 10 to 15 minutes

317
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,560
uh for the to accept the to accept the

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
agreement between them then that you're

319
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
going to pay the ransom and then they're

320
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,519
going to decrypt your files

321
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,200
another thing here is that the affiliate

322
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,240
itself

323
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
uh because they give you the platform

324
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,720
for free so they expect from you

325
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,680
to

326
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,240
bring victims to bring money okay so

327
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
they put a lot of effort on you they

328
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
they say okay if you don't bring a new

329
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,200
victims you're going to close your

330
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
account you will never ever have another

331
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,320
another chance with us etc etc so

332
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,040
they're pushing they're making a target

333
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,600
on target earnings kind of things to

334
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,040
this to these guys okay so it's

335
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,519
interesting

336
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,040
now

337
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
jump into a technical analysis uh so

338
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,519
this section going to going to contain

339
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
uh going to contain the management

340
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,160
portal of the of the ransomware service

341
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
uh we're going to also also

342
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
contain a ransomware samples you can you

343
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
can find them you know in our portal and

344
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
you can find them also in virustop

345
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
everywhere he also at the encryption

346
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,839
software and step-by-step analysis of

347
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
the lock bit attack kill chain because

348
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,760
the wall attack kill chain is

349
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
interesting it's really how they start

350
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
and how the wall situation is evolving

351
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,639
to that point where you are forced to

352
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,120
pay the ransom let's start with the kill

353
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,839
chain okay so here the first thing

354
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,160
is the target selection

355
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
so lock bit affiliates they use mass

356
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,480
vulnerability scanners phishing and

357
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
traditional stuffing right to find the

358
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,760
new victims okay they also

359
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,200
as you can see here as you can see in

360
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,839
our reports they also buy a compromise

361
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,320
remote desktop removes desktop mdp

362
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
servers they buy a compromise servers

363
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,040
from the underground et cetera et cetera

364
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
most important thing that we've found

365
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,120
here is that they also use affordable

366
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,600
vpn exploitation uh it was one of the

367
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,399
methods used uh that we detected within

368
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,800
this cnc server inside right so they use

369
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,240
this kind of vulnerabilities from the

370
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,320
vendors in this case fortinet can be

371
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
anybody else right

372
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
nothing is perfect nobody is perfect

373
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,760
right we all know that so uh for that

374
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
reason uh yeah they use this kind of

375
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,240
this kind of things here here you can

376
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
see how the user attack vector starts

377
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,760
okay

378
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,440
still in the preparation phase when

379
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
they're gaining access to the target so

380
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
it doesn't matter did they if they

381
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,279
purchase the compromised server or they

382
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,600
use hackers to compromise it or they

383
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,160
compromise by their self and now lately

384
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,240
i was also reading on the news that they

385
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,839
also try to uh to bribe a company users

386
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,519
to deliver a ransomware that's really

387
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,079
interesting right they pick a company a

388
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,639
big one they reach out to some people

389
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,839
hey you know

390
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,440
do you want to deploy around smarter

391
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,800
company so we're going to split the

392
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
money i we have seen this kind of things

393
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,839
happening lately right now

394
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,920
so they own the machine they start the

395
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,000
enumeration process they check if there

396
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
is any controllers that they check for

397
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,839
domain controller they check for backup

398
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,320
servers bus servers so everything that

399
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,480
can store data everything that can be

400
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
encrypted right

401
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
uh after that they start the data

402
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
exploitation so before the encryption

403
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,240
they extract the data

404
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
they store data in the safe place

405
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,959
they evaluate the inside of the data to

406
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,440
determinate if they are going to do

407
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
extortion for for the for the right for

408
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
the for the for the victim itself or

409
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
they only just going to end it and

410
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,000
they're going to ask money for them they

411
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,519
push everything on the mega upload

412
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,160
server and then they are ready to go

413
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
then the next thing is

414
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,639
after the data is exploitation

415
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,160
they

416
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
can go back to the run server as a

417
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,000
service web page as you can see here and

418
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,399
they can generate a

419
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,600
unique ransomware sample for that victim

420
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,320
okay so now they have the data

421
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
the data is cool

422
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,279
it's valuable

423
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,920
they proceed here so you log into your

424
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,480
control panel you download your unique

425
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,519
malware sample only for this victim okay

426
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,240
and then you deploy

427
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
the ransomware in your victim to start

428
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,279
encryption process

429
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,120
transformer is certainly executed

430
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
manually when i say manually this is

431
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
what we have seen like a delivery method

432
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,040
but if there is some idea in place some

433
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
i don't know ransomware protection in

434
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,959
place some next av in place of course

435
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,880
they can leverage also the exploitation

436
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,959
they can leverage some zero day it's

437
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,720
it's up to them right it's deep it's up

438
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,959
to the protection of the end point how

439
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,880
hard on it is the endpoint itself and

440
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,399
what kind of methods they're going to

441
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,959
use to bypass these hardening techniques

442
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,240
so

443
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,320
ransomware is executed right

444
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,440
uh

445
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,240
when

446
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,959
everything is uh so so again so

447
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,560
execution is happening recognizing

448
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
spaces is trying to animate all

449
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,079
accessible directories and network

450
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,079
shares so this is where the run server

451
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
itself is deleting the shadow copies

452
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,399
using vss admin and then he is searching

453
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,240
everything that can be encryptable and

454
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
he's starting to encrypt each file with

455
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
random isc okay

456
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
so i sk this is very important

457
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,680
uh and then

458
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,440
with the static public key inside the

459
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,800
log bit sample is again so they encrypt

460
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,360
also the k inside of it and they use a

461
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,639
specific offset inside of the file here

462
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,120
and this shows and this is making them

463
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,360
like a unique k for every single file

464
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
that is encrypted on the endpoint so

465
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,639
this is again

466
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,120
you know that this is very is

467
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,720
interesting to to

468
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,639
you know to avoid uh

469
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,560
somebody to reverse engineer around

470
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
somewhere and to find some flow in the

471
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,440
encryption itself and to start

472
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
decrypting the files using the sims

473
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,000
using the master key so to prevent this

474
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
they encrypt everything individually

475
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,280
and now what is happening the demand and

476
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,079
negotiation right so now all important

477
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,160
households are cryptics

478
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,839
backups are deleted the shadow copies

479
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,919
and stuff like that and the wallpaper is

480
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,839
changed now they are asking for a

481
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,199
ransomware this is when you are

482
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,079
realizing that something is happening

483
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,679
and that you need to prepare your wallet

484
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,359
to pay the ransom if you are stupid of

485
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,599
course

486
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,760
here on the c on the on the left side

487
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,880
you see uh is is the the place basically

488
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
where all your files is encrypted

489
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,160
they're asking how much money you're

490
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,200
going to pay

491
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,400
how much

492
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,760
time you have

493
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,559
uh

494
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,480
also restore my file takes file is

495
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,919
created

496
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,760
and help file is also there right on the

497
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,440
desktop so you can read your help file

498
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,039
if you need a help how to restore your

499
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,360
files so they're pretty much you know

500
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,200
they're very helpful right they help you

501
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,160
to

502
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
register your files

503
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,280
here as you can see

504
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,200
the lock bit decrypt at the top and the

505
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,760
on your web at this it contains a fusion

506
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
instruction for purchasing the software

507
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
and to decrypting your files using a

508
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,919
sample sample

509
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,160
encrypted sample file okay

510
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,000
to be able to access this you must use a

511
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
top okay so that's one of one of the one

512
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,520
of the interesting thing and then in

513
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,200
this manual here they're also teaching

514
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,440
you how to install the tor and how to

515
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,160
reach out reach out to this to these two

516
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
domains that you see in the top here on

517
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,799
the laptop

518
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,799
and then also they have a sample uh

519
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,360
update here basically you can check

520
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
uh about

521
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,919
sorry you can check if if your files is

522
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,000
encrypted correctly and if can be

523
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,240
decrypted correctly and also a chat

524
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,760
support here where you can chat with

525
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,600
them where you can negotiate how much

526
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
you need to pay etc etc

527
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,559
next one management panel so here

528
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,320
you manage

529
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,919
how you call uh you manage the

530
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,640
affiliates here okay so he this is uh

531
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,160
this is also accessible by the torn

532
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
network it was hidden service right

533
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,280
again and it was a managing victims

534
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
affiliate accounts generating neurons

535
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,480
somewhere bills and servants like

536
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,919
services

537
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,760
and serving the decrypted software if

538
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
the demand runs on with paid so here you

539
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
are putting

540
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,679
what the the service

541
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
what your victim is going to receive

542
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,520
after they're going to pay the rounds

543
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,200
okay so you here you define the

544
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,400
unlocking keys etc thanks not right or

545
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,799
maybe invoicing right if you want to if

546
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,880
you want to invoice them you know for

547
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,120
some kind of i don't know tax return and

548
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
stuff like that this became a business

549
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,600
you know it's really really scary

550
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
again trail

551
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,240
mechanism here uh this is mandatory okay

552
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,200
so

553
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,039
this is very important i mean like

554
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,600
affiliate you cannot decrypt

555
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,919
any victim if you don't have a sample

556
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,000
actual sample from the victim itself and

557
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
they do these checks to avoid somebody

558
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,880
else to you know to steal the victims to

559
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
be able to

560
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,600
to be able to to avoid uh you know fight

561
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
between the bad guys for uh for a week

562
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,240
team so they made this kind of you know

563
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
uh mechanism to to make sure that your

564
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,760
victims are yours and somebody else's

565
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,080
victims are are owned by himself you

566
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
know so this is really interesting here

567
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,600
also on the chat here you can under

568
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,120
victim button you can see the mastering

569
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,240
session case right et cetera so uh first

570
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,480
and last video days total views builders

571
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,120
so basically they comments so they keep

572
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,280
all kind of statistics about the about

573
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,360
their victims and what what they're

574
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,158
going to do with their victims

575
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,200
yeah some statistics here as you can see

576
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,039
uh view chart present

577
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,840
visited victims recent upload test files

578
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,159
right so basically here you go here you

579
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,840
are actually seeing your business

580
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,760
because victim means business right and

581
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,120
here you can see

582
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,480
all of your victims et cetera et cetera

583
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
and also inside of the affiliate

584
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,520
management dashboard here where you're

585
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
going to

586
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,679
send the creator for that again remember

587
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,000
the decrypt application works only for

588
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,799
that victim okay because when the victim

589
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,000
pays the money

590
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,720
and when the money is divided by the

591
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,679
ransomware as a service owners then you

592
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,640
then for the affiliate is is

593
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
is enabled the option to

594
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
have a decryption

595
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,640
application okay so it's interesting so

596
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,400
they control everything right

597
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
so you got the victim you managed to

598
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,120
you managed to extract money from him

599
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
the money has been paid and now finally

600
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,760
you can send your victim a decrypter

601
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,520
that you can drop from the from the

602
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,720
management portal itself

603
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,760
now from the admin side right so this is

604
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,720
the owners so we also managed to get

605
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
inside of the owner's portal of the of

606
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,360
the ransomware as a service right so

607
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,039
what we've seen at the beginning it was

608
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,600
up the victims the affiliate and now the

609
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,120
owners okay so here as you can see there

610
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,080
right i mean they use uh my my php admin

611
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,720
so basically uh

612
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,960
they can uh they can manage the the

613
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,760
mysql right php and mysql actually what

614
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,000
we saw what what we saw in this in this

615
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,240
cnc server but what was the most

616
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,720
important thing here is that with

617
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,880
phpmyadmin

618
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,679
they can extract

619
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,679
the encryption case for every single

620
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,799
user without having access to the

621
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,400
affiliate portal

622
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,039
right so this is stabbing back

623
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,679
the affiliates if they don't comply

624
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,120
with their game okay so that means that

625
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,600
if you have some i don't know conflict

626
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,640
with a

627
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,720
uh with a with a run sooner as a service

628
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,760
provider

629
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
then you can lose all of your encrypted

630
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,320
victims because they can still access

631
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
using this onion address and they can

632
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,919
extract all the

633
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,320
uh decryption case of your victims okay

634
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,159
so they take over the victims by

635
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,799
themselves if there is some you know

636
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,200
conflict of of interest or whatever it

637
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
is so this was also very interesting to

638
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
see here right that they always have

639
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,840
some kind of vector to the bad guys who

640
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,760
are actually working for them

641
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,600
and the decryptor right

642
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,880
so here uh from the victim side right

643
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
on the victim side you when you pay the

644
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,200
money when they got their split when the

645
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,360
system itself allows you to

646
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,080
send the the victim the decrypter the

647
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,919
victim finally can

648
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,799
click and can download the the decrypter

649
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,640
itself okay so this is from the victim

650
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,679
side to to see the to see what's going

651
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,960
on so basically you click and you

652
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,039
decrypt the files

653
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,880
some dynamization about the data that we

654
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
found okay so our team uh yeah we reveal

655
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,919
the identity of the log beta affiliates

656
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,400
relay retailers and developers itself so

657
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,520
they use

658
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,760
uh they use a jabber so this is their

659
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
jabber contact account so maybe

660
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
maybe you're going to take some

661
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
screenshots here you can do a few

662
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,000
further research no problem you can do

663
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,520
that

664
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,919
uh next one is uh yeah username number

665
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,600
of big things registered and lost access

666
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,360
that's for every lobby affiliate so

667
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,120
these are the affiliates and look how

668
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,760
many victims they have okay so every

669
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,360
single of these guys they made a good

670
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,880
money right but in total if you see here

671
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,960
the ransomware as a service owners they

672
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,919
made a huge money right because you know

673
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,559
they managed to have some good sales

674
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,320
team here right they built a very good

675
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,120
sales team and this sales team performed

676
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
very well you know bringing all these

677
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,799
weak teams

678
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,559
into this into this trap you know

679
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,679
yeah uh again here uh

680
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,039
the aliases of of of of the at the

681
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,440
jobber addresses of couple of uh uh

682
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,320
affiliates uh revealed to be uh also

683
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,600
working for babuk and the rebel

684
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,520
ransomware groups okay so we also

685
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,919
detected this so this affiliates these

686
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,919
bad guys they are also

687
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:56,720
uh

688
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
we also have seen them or their

689
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,679
nicknames or their you know aliases

690
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
well well we were also you know

691
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
researching a bubble can reveal around

692
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,600
somewhere groups

693
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,559
again

694
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,320
uh the connection between two threat

695
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
actors and this of that because we have

696
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,640
still have ongoing investigation and

697
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,600
everything

698
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
and by the way you know when we start

699
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,360
the investigation we always

700
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,840
inform the law enforcements always

701
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,200
especially in switzerland because the

702
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,520
company is based in switzerland and then

703
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,279
when we inform them

704
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,240
the wall you know pink and punk

705
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
in connection with the law enforcement

706
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,120
is so slow that we are in hurry to

707
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,279
publish what we are finding but we

708
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,200
cannot publish because we from the lao

709
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,679
informants love love informants

710
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,279
enforcements and we are starting we are

711
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,200
waiting the green will let for them for

712
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
the reason sometimes you know it end up

713
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,679
that after three months after five

714
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,520
months after two years to reveal a

715
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,159
report right but we started we

716
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,080
intercepted and we informed the law

717
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
enforcement two years ago but because

718
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,000
the investigation was ongoing so we

719
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
couldn't reveal the report okay so also

720
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
here we cannot reveal too much of the

721
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
correlation between these two groups but

722
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,440
we know a lot of a lot of things about

723
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,159
what's going on in the back end

724
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,440
uh again hitting them back right yeah we

725
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,080
capture ip address right or one of one

726
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
of these affiliates

727
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,480
uh yeah he's a logbit developers one of

728
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
the lobby developers right

729
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
based on our observation here is a tor

730
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,320
network right using vpn uh yeah uh again

731
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
linux we managed to fingerprint the

732
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,880
operating system itself right uh it has

733
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,400
a the

734
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
cost name of fibonacci

735
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,240
i mean i don't know maybe it's italian

736
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,400
name or i don't know i don't want to

737
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,640
i don't want to make assumption but yeah

738
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,400
this is what we

739
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
until where we came with this with this

740
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,400
with this cnc server of course there is

741
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,760
a lot of things that has been shared

742
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,679
also with the law enforcement but this

743
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,840
is what we can share right now so again

744
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,640
yeah

745
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,320
you know sometimes

746
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
we are luck we have a luck to hit them

747
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
back and to reveal who they are and to

748
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,600
share with the police and stuff like

749
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,760
that

750
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,600
again some statistics here sector sector

751
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,960
distribution of the victims for

752
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,799
transportation manufacturing customer

753
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,960
services energy food everything right so

754
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,360
basically they were targeting everything

755
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,679
so we didn't detect some kind of you

756
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,799
know gail

757
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,720
gale offense right where they target

758
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,559
only specific country like we had on the

759
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,679
silverfish

760
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,919
uh research before right which was uh

761
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,960
excluding the ex-russian countries here

762
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,720
they don't have that kind of stuff so

763
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,559
they go for everybody

764
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,679
which uh going to fail

765
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,480
to their uh run somewhere or or to their

766
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,799
attacks right

767
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,320
uh

768
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,200
yeah

769
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,720
also that we managed to calculate the

770
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,399
average ransom which was around eighty

771
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,239
five thousand dollars per per week

772
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,520
uh of course uh some wallet id and how

773
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,880
the money flow

774
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
was they use a wasabi network right

775
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
because they join and mix

776
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,320
in a small chunks right when they

777
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,559
distribute the money to be able to

778
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,120
to to avoid tracking and stuff like that

779
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,679
yeah but you can see all the btc bitcoin

780
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,600
values and and the amount that they

781
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,639
transfer to each other

782
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
uh

783
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,919
yep so now i'm going to do uh some very

784
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,240

play with usta okay which is very very

788
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
interesting threat intelligence platform

789
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
bit by our team

790
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,720

google chrome okay i hope that you can

794
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,440
see my screen right this is ustop right

795
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
the the threat intelligence platform

796
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,279
that is developed by our team

797
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,200
this is the main main dashboard of the

798
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,799
list here you can see our rav data

799
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,559
occurs by our rooster sensor so we

800
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,480
deploy sensor all around the world and

801
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,320
we fetch intelligence from them

802
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
uh also here on the left side left side

803
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,159
you can see a tactical intelligence

804
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,240
tactical intelligence meaning that or

805
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,200
team of more than 60 plus people are

806
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,520
heavily in underground monitoring and

807
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,960
and and

808
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,559
extracting data from the underground

809
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,440
forums highly private forums and then

810
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,520
trying to build up reports

811
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
uh about the campaigns about what's

812
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,520
going on in this report in these forums

813
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,880
and stuff like that

814
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,480
we have also throughout the intelligence

815
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,600
here so basically the full blonde uh

816
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,279
working solution with the rest api

817
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,880
support and stuff like that especially

818
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,480

that

823
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,640
also brand protection is one of the one

824
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,120
of the features that the platform has

825
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,159
security intelligence vulnerabilities i

826
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,360
don't want to bother you guys i know

827

852
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,880
monitor the vet2 version 2 of the log

853
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,960

859
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,159
involved involved and but

860
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,159
we cannot publish anything yet because

861
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,320

862
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,159

version two of the log bit runs

867
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,240
