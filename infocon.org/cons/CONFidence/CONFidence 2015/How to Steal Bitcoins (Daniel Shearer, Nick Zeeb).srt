1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,779
writes this is the heart of Silicon
takashimaya other stuff here so I just

2
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:09,070
briefly address ourselves I'm Nick Zeeb
this is my colleague Daniel over here

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,780
but we're not coming today is we want to
cover the coin an overview some of the

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,029
attacks have been carried out against
the people the software and the protocol

5
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:23,029
and as we go along with gonna go from
less sophisticated taxed more

6
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:27,779
sophisticated attacks and as we go along
with an assault on explained it works

7
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,060
well see get the two in one

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,170
ok so in case you know nothing about it
coin is the Internet version of gold

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,300
that is a definite think of it it is
fundamentally limited they will only

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,780
ever be 20 1,000,000 coins found in the
whole time the whole the world and each

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,960
Bitcoin is currently worth about $240
right now so how can I use declined to

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,300
pay for things well here's a screenshot
of someone using a wallet application on

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,199
their phone to pay a merchant for a
service that providing here by scanning

14
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,739
the QR code that's all you need to do
you scan some as QR codes and he can

15
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,908
send the money now this much and has a
sign here says they accept Bitcoin so

16
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,500
you no longer have to use dirty old
government money over here now the point

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,130
about the coin is that you can make any
payment to anyone like this they don't

18
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,310
have to be next to you you can be
anywhere in the world and ask for

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,890
someone to send you money you can send
money to anyone in the world for any

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,229
amount for less than a cent within
minutes

21
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:29,460
also the payments that you make are
irreversible they're like handing over

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,820
cash so let's have a look at how we can
use the property to try and get hold of

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,419
some of these well as a No systems we
know the most wonderful part of a system

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,670
usually is found right here so let's see
if we can find someone who wants

25
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,390
something for nothing and give them
nothing for something so here is an

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:55,390
actual real scam that was run using
Bitcoin called crypto double and they

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,200
market themselves as a place where if
you give them money they gonna double

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,810
your money guaranteed in just 100 hours
now I'm sure all of you would look at

29
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,590
that go holy shit that is not legit that
sounds really dodgy well good night

30
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,270
everyone thought that way some people
thought billion

31
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,240
this is a really good idea if you if you
look into the selective it had a look at

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,630
the FAQ is like you know how how we can
guarantee this amazing claim you know

33
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,930
they would say like we're a bunch of
like really advanced traders like we

34
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,030
really know what we're doing with an
arbitrage these markets over here we can

35
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,060
use our superior knowledge of what's
going on with a double your money and he

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,060
said ok well why do you only take
Bitcoin or other keep their currencies

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,850
like that oh well you know because it's
cheaper to speed ascended we don't have

38
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,019
a credit card fees of course because
also ever stumble it makes it very

39
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,820
useful for them though if you'd invested
money in this afterwhile things started

40
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,660
to go wrong this is their Twitter feeds
the refuse so-called stuck withdrawals

41
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,840
don't worry about it is gonna be ok then
they claimed there was a highly

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,940
coordinated and massive DDoS attack but
don't worry our engineer handle it as

43
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,430
you can probably imagine this money
never got to see it come back and people

44
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,190
lost about half a million dollars in
this scheme so that's a very simple

45
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,970
social engineering trick

46
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,100
another way to you still get coins is to
make use of the property that pic

47
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,440
open-source anyone can take the Bitcoin
source code orkut make some minor

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,320
modifications to it and tell you that
they have been bent the next big thing

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,950
and if you guys are smart enough to get
an early on call at coin EA here if you

50
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,190
guys buy into this I'm going to
guarantee all rich is gonna be a next

51
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,820
big corn and of course this happens all
the time there's over 500 variants of

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,510
their currencies some of them are real
innovations are going wrong but I think

53
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,870
many of them are probably scams this
particular coin here was a coin that was

54
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:59,720
launched supposedly on the celebrity of
Kanye West and after he said he's not

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,780
supporting this project I decided to use
this picture said not everything that

56
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,330
shines as digital gold that's the
message here

57
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,940
ok let's have a look a bit more into the
software so this is a screenshot of a

58
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,969
wallet now I apologize for this dot
matrix projected that we're using here

59
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,799
but bear with me this is a a desktop
wallet and a wallet in bed

60
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,469
point is a bit of software that holds
that shows you what balance you have to

61
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,180
this user has only about 50 cents a bit
with a Bitcoin you have an address on

62
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,789
the system which people can use to send
you money and here is my address book

63
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:36,520
where you have other people's addresses
and that's what they look like and you

64
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,940
can see here they got the Free Software
Foundation WikiLeaks in other places you

65
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,830
can send money to and crucially and what
the what it does is the wallet allows

66
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,050
you to make transactions on the network

67
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,909
the wall it doesn't hold any bitcoins in
touch with a holes as a private key and

68
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:56,629
the private key is used to sign
transactions as you and anyone who has

69
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,259
access the private key cansada
transaction as you and move balances

70
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:06,199
around the network so you must keep your
private key private absolutely if that

71
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,620
doesn't happen you can be in trouble so
let's make use of that property how can

72
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,479
we get hold of someone's private key

73
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,699
well here's a good attempt this is a
real phishing attack that happened in

74
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,819
Bitcoin it is an email that said hello
David why not david most these a male

75
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,710
and you cannot be this that the summary
is can you please help me out here I've

76
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,120
got a pic when will it not that kind of
stuck please can you help me get them

77
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,050
out I thought you know thirty bitcoins
are stuck in this address in fact if you

78
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,610
look at this

79
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,190
explore aside here you could see they
were actually 31 stuck in this address

80
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,919
and they were saying okay please help me
she is my password can you please get

81
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,229
them out for me and send it to me thank
you very much so the aim is to try and

82
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,150
get you to click on this link to
download the so-called password yes as

83
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,679
you can probably imagine clicking on
that link doesn't actually give you

84
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,860
access to 30 victorians yeah it gives me
something like this which could sort of

85
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,599
be a password in a text documents the
kinda suspicious-looking command prompt

86
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,190
behind their baby indicates there's a
bit more going on this is actually just

87
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,219
setting up a persistent back door to
allow the attackers to remotely access

88
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:17,500
your machine and remotely access your
wallet and it's possible to encrypt

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,340
while it's been a lot of people do that
if they do then they just have to add

90
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,750
some key logger and pick up your
password for last and this is just one

91
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,979
little piece of malware there's a lot of
malware out there that's geared toward

92
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:30,609
attacking

93
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,520
decline in 2013 this report came out
last year about 2013 records found that

94
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,128
about 22 percent of the financial
related malware attacks that they were

95
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:44,939
texting right-to-carry towards attacking
people's bakeries are trying to steal

96
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,599
people's minds and its coverage like a
whole host of different types of malware

97
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,120
you got the access to all that we just
saw and there's other other piece of

98
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,430
malware which has she tried to attack
your wallet directly there is one called

99
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,520
clings to life which one typo says he
lost about $14,000 to that particular

100
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,799
piece of malware it would actually
masquerade as a legitimate speculated

101
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,289
utility to help you receive payments
more anonymously but it was in the

102
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,990
background or just interact with your
wallet and send all of your phones to

103
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,370
the attacker and this this property of
pretending to be a legitimate utility is

104
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,110
kind of common in the backline malware
like it lets the attack targets

105
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,169
elections are the kind of people that
are downloading these utilities are the

106
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,889
kind of people that would have any money
there's another one which poses a vanity

107
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,300
address generator so that would be
something I just generate a whole load

108
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,120
of public-private key pairs so that you
can get a more friendly bickering

109
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,610
address addresses their to ride from the
public key and they're typically not

110
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,050
particularly friendly this is what
address looks like that you can't really

111
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,089
tell anything from that address about
who's this is actually a dress for the

112
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:58,009
tales projects but it's sort of
machine-readable and not particularly

113
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,879
geared towards humans so what you would
do if you wanted to make a donation to

114
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,199
the tales projects then usually just go
to their web sites go find their

115
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,990
backline address and you're not gonna
just gonna typed out so people just copy

116
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,889
go to their wallets and then paste it in
there and then when you head saying

117
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:23,680
you're sending the bighorns two tables
or that's how things should work there

118
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,770
is another piece of ours does something
kind of needs you may have noticed that

119
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,289
the address that was pasted it there
doesn't actually match the dress that

120
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:35,140
was called this was some very simple
piece of malware which had at least one

121
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,088
guy sort of worried on reddit

122
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,459
this was something that someone actually
poses a big corner related game it was

123
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,819
like some RPG were you complete question
he supposedly are in real bitcoins as

124
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:48,420
rewards but really I just leave
something running in the background

125
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,620
which monitors your clipboard at any
time I see something that looks like a

126
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,649
Bitcoin address because they're quite
distinctive just replace it with the

127
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,440
address of the attacker and because
they're not very human readable most

128
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,520
people just gonna take it in and hits
and realize that you're sending money to

129
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,779
attack and one of the new things about
this is it's not going after just one

130
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,410
particular application of the wallet is
now a lot of different while it's a very

131
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,189
few native applications or web
applications as well this is a popular

132
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,990
web based while it's this one i think is
the most well-known web based while it

133
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,569
is run by blocking all the info on these
guys actually started out as a site for

134
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:32,319
allow you to view and navigate around
the corner transactions so this is their

135
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:35,599
their navigator interface and hear it
down here you can see these are the

136
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,699
recent transactions in Victoria and
these are these are not just your

137
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:41,459
transactions

138
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,199
this is not like your account history
kind of thing this is the show's all

139
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:49,069
transactions that were taking place on
on the bickering that work so one of the

140
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:53,260
things that you need to understand how
bickering works is that is to see how it

141
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,110
differs from conventional currencies
usually you would have some kind of

142
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,339
token like you have a dollar bill or you
can give to somebody and then you're

143
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:04,579
transferring some money today otherwise
they'll be some kind of central

144
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:08,680
authority like a bank for example which
will maintain people's balances and you

145
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,219
can ask your bank to transfer some money
to somebody else with the claim there is

146
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,930
none of that there is no physical tokens
are you can just hand to somebody and

147
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:23,290
central authorities what you have with
big line is a public ledger it's a

148
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,640
complete list of all the transactions
that ever happens in bickering and

149
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,569
because they are their public then
everybody on the network of potentially

150
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:36,939
a volume that work will have a copy of
this nature and because it's complete to

151
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,079
has every transaction has ever taken
place you can use this later to

152
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,010
calculate

153
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,970
balances are so at any given time you
know your balance is the sum of all of

154
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,470
the bighorns I've been sent to you

155
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,040
minus any big plans that you send
somebody else and when you want to

156
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,459
create a transactional you want to spend
because you say that these declines that

157
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,530
everybody knows I perceived I'm now
sending them over here and then

158
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:06,500
everybody knows that guy's balances
don't open your balances downtown so we

159
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,890
take a look at the transaction on the
left we go to transaction inputs this is

160
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,670
about where you're saying that you're
all these ones I'm spending and this

161
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,910
case the personal spending around nine
and a half declines and you can specify

162
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,670
multiple in particular if this guy when
it has been more than that you could

163
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,949
specify other transactions or receive
pic lines and then you have more to

164
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,930
spend in a transaction in this case he
sending it to the three outputs on the

165
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,489
right

166
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:44,320
transaction but this is the destination
addresses and if we take a look at this

167
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,050
one just here you can see this 1 2010
address is being sent about 2.3 6 picket

168
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,930
lines you can see that it says spent
this person who are set to they've

169
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:04,439
already spent that's because we have a
complete public list of transactions you

170
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,440
can go forward and see this is the
transaction where they are spending

171
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,650
their bickering this this is the address
with the 2.36 Pickering's and this is

172
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,030
how the transactions or to fit together
the output from one transaction make up

173
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:22,740
to later transactions so the way that
you ensure that the intended recipients

174
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,270
can can spend that kind of interesting
as well how that works

175
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,880
say Alice went to st. end according to
Bob she doesn't have to name Bob

176
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,730
directly in the transaction

177
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,950
what she does is Jackie poses a puzzle
that only bob consult and this is done

178
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:43,890
using the built-in programming language
so here Alice creates a a partial

179
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:49,660
program which is locking up the phones
here she sending ten horns are now

180
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,860
locked up

181
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,200
only Baba be able to unlock some and
when bob despite even suspenders he

182
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,480
created jobs public he said this is what
indicating that it's possible to

183
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,460
anybody's allowed to spend them and when
he decides to spend them he creates

184
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:12,460
another transaction where he specifies
some data which completes this program

185
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,120
and this program now can be executed so
when bob creates a transaction that you

186
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,650
will broadcast network and everybody
will be able to execute this program in

187
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,270
its entirety and verify that this is a
valid transaction and what this does

188
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,470
best buy the signature on the private
and the public key the signature is

189
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,680
signing the transaction that he's
created with the private key that

190
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,489
corresponds to the public yet he
specified and the public he must have to

191
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:44,890
the value that specifies and her are
open scripts and if all of those things

192
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,060
are true then everybody knows that this
is a legitimate transaction fees were in

193
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,109
fact intended for ball but he has now
spent so if we take a look at a real

194
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,120
transaction here this is unlocked and
again you can see you have the output

195
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,100
scripts down there has got to grips
because this transaction is sending to

196
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,790
two different addresses and this kind of
program here this is the the same kind

197
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,699
of her going to show you in this the
previous lies this is the most common

198
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,050
way of sending because it's called it
paid a public key hash because it's got

199
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,490
the hash of the recipients public in it
and these instructions here the things

200
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,880
starting with all these are the
parameters of the bickering programming

201
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,220
language that only a few that make up
this this kind of transaction but

202
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,170
there's a lot more opcodes in the
language but which allows you to be much

203
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,079
more flexible with the transactions are
you create it also lets you do a lot of

204
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,820
other kind of funny things there's one
interesting opportunity and bad

205
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,820
arbitrate any transaction so here you
can see this transaction has an

206
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,170
opportune statements which is just
sending a message to you guys and this

207
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,790
is used for a variety of different
things there is a proven system service

208
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,300
which lets you upload documents and it
gets embedded in it

209
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,969
transaction and you can then see or
anybody can see that at the time that

210
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,470
transactions created that document
existed in that form there's also a

211
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:17,050
proposal last month from the people I'm
TLS for using Opera tiring to help pls

212
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,089
certificate revocation you don't need to
use significant revenue revocation lists

213
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:27,670
her spirit ever given that we can
invading army dating transactions

214
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,149
there's a lot more fun things you can do
it that's very common mistake that a lot

215
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:36,570
of developers make when they're building
software which is correctly identify

216
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,160
user inputs usually developers think
about input as being the ways in which

217
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,920
users interacting with the software that
they're writing at the bottom of that

218
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,550
users click on the forms a subnet but
given that anybody in the world can

219
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,890
invade arbitrary data and it's now being
displayed in a website this is

220
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:57,860
effectively inputs to this particular
site and given that it was only a matter

221
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:05,000
of time before somebody tried putting
JavaScript any transaction fairly benign

222
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,329
example it doesn't do anything now but I
used to look more like that we're

223
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:12,620
actually executing JavaScript and that
that's kind of a dangerous thing to do

224
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,430
to be executing our retreat JavaScript
in the context of a javascript declined

225
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,250
while it was there is a very simple
attack here where you just saying

226
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,300
somebody some small number of declines
in your including JavaScript in the

227
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,229
transaction and when they see they they
click on the transaction and the

228
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:35,070
JavaScript execution and transfers their
entire balance back to you a while ago

229
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,700
blocked or chain of 66 that there's also
an hour and 45 limit on the amount of

230
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,380
Haiti can include an inopportune
statements it's being increased age

231
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,510
bites but at the moment

232
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,949
40 bytes is all you have to work for or
how to work with forty-eight happens to

233
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:54,459
be the exact amount to do that to you
can embed

234
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,690
external javascript using a URL
shortener if you're using a GPS it

235
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,850
should really require 41 bytes but if
you just miss off the closing angle

236
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,250
bracket on your script and then the
browser is quite forgiving it was a

237
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:14,250
minor development Aaron it executed
anyway so that's something you can do a

238
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,890
transaction outfits but let's have a
look at a transaction input again so I

239
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:25,120
mentioned before that the transaction
inputs that's an example wolpe specified

240
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,120
area a signature and a public key and
there they are you can see these unblock

241
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,389
change the signatures are actually
produced using the elliptic curve

242
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:40,540
digital signature algorithm and I'm not
gonna go deep into the mass spam and how

243
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,710
easy to say works but the important part
to know is that your signature consists

244
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,870
of two components are an ass valleys and
there is a random number AM which is

245
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:58,770
used to make up there is there's also
the private key K which is used to make

246
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:05,900
up the ass value and one of the rules
say is that you must never reuse the

247
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,530
same value of n for multiple signatures
are the same private key if you do one

248
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,060
thing that will happen is that this
value will also be the same across

249
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,040
multiple signatures and that makes these
signatures very easy to spot you can

250
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,330
just look through all the transactions
that some of these signs and if you find

251
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,280
one where the more the one where they
are components of a second-round match

252
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,639
then you know it was created using the
same value and the other side effect of

253
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,150
that you can take the two values from
those two signatures and you can

254
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,760
actually held directly calculate the
private key so once a private even

255
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,510
compromise that anybody can go and spend
your bitcoins so it is important they

256
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,420
use a strong random number generator
there the value of m is large enough

257
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:55,350
that any half-decent random number
generator should never be values RAM but

258
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,909
sometimes people don't do random
terribly well we can take a look at this

259
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,120
transaction here

260
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,969
these signatures was added to our
components which if we zoom in on those

261
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:12,300
you'll see the identical which means
these two signatures were produced using

262
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,760
the same value of n so the private key
is not compromised and this seems to

263
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,879
happen it seems like about once a year
this is an example from 2012 in 2013

264
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,610
there is a weakness in job is secure
around him which led to the Android

265
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,780
becoming while it's repeating am values
which made which allows some people's

266
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,178
private key to be compromised than last
year blocked chain had a similar issue

267
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:43,150
the iraqi trying to update their
JavaScript wallets to increase people

268
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,970
they're using and they accidentally
reduced to 21 points so they were a

269
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:53,410
repeat repeat again values very often in
this case there when this started

270
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,420
happening and these transactions with
them

271
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,120
repeated our values are showing up on
the ledger there is one guy called you

272
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,870
who actually spotted this was going on
and he swept up more than $300,000 worth

273
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,129
of coins from compromise private keys
and then once blocking fix the issue he

274
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,120
gave it all back so that was kind of
nice and this is a problem that doesn't

275
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,090
just affect bickering it's anybody's
using ECSA can be potentially vulnerable

276
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:22,490
to this kind of attack in 2010 this is
the same technique that the group they

277
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,970
deliver flow actually used to crack the
private key is used her signing codes

278
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,630
for the ps3 in that case is random
number generator just always return the

279
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,450
same value which made it quite easy for
them the slide I showed you earlier but

280
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,950
with a mass on it from there

281
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,429
talk they gave a chaos and yet this is
one way that private keys can be

282
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:48,250
compromised like a private keys
obviously it's quite important to keep

283
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,929
them private which does mean that if you
happen to be on television

284
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,670
don't hold it up to the camera to show
people what the private key looks like

285
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:08,350
the headlines that follow that kind of
inevitable by Stan ok so let's have

286
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,059
a bit reluctant to the actual more so we
mention that decline is a peer-to-peer

287
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,110
network there is like this said there's
no central note there's no one bit of

288
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,189
fun of computing architecture you can
take out working it is like BitTorrent

289
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,870
in that notes really connect to each
other and they share the statement at

290
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,000
work with each other so at this point
you have what we call a distributed

291
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,770
ledger every node in the network is
aware that currently alice is the holder

292
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,970
of two bitcoins and Bob owns one that
everyone is in agreement about that fact

293
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,190
so let's have a look at what the notes
are actually storing it's not just the

294
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,520
current state they actually in the
entire history of all transactions ever

295
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,059
taken place like that was saying and
they do this through a data structure

296
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,620
that we can show here what they do is
they group about 10 minutes with the

297
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,439
transactions into a collection called
the block and that block will then be

298
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,850
referenced by another block this is the
first transactions in the next election

299
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,918
I get take place on another block and a
half point up points back to the

300
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,750
previous block and this way the
structure keeps building up in an

301
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,419
immutable ledger that cannot have a
history changed by simply pointing

302
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:18,490
backwards the previous block using this
data structure has called the block

303
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:24,799
chain that's so as its ok so how do new
transactions get included a block how

304
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,889
does actually do that to happen at any
one point in the network you have the

305
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,270
last known blocks in at the last agreed
block which is here and you have a bunch

306
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,700
of transactions that are not getting a
block people have to simply broadcast

307
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,309
network broadcasting any note and the
crime bill use what's called a gossip

308
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:45,530
protocol where I tell a message to you
say you tell tell your friends I tell

309
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,620
their friends are just spreads like
wildfire that whenever a copy of

310
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,580
everything is broadcast so after that
there is a race that happens were all

311
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,668
the nodes and who attempt to create the
next block their gold miners they will

312
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:04,270
take all of the outstanding transactions
the unconfirmed ones here adds a random

313
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,320
value to all the outstanding
transactions and then they will take a

314
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,070
hash of this all the state up and create
a hash value and bit the Bitcoin

315
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,240
protocol specifies that the first person
you can find a number here that will

316
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,830
produce a hash value below a certain
value called the difficulty

317
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:27,779
it gets the gets to create a new block
and so what happens if people try lotto

318
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,970
numbers in the first person to find
something that works again you can't

319
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,409
predict the outcome so you just have to
keep going until you find one in this

320
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:38,820
case the difficulty was below a thousand
is the first person to find a solution

321
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,139
what they do they take all outstanding
transactions like this the group into a

322
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,010
block and they add crucially one extra
transaction in there called the block

323
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,789
reward this is how all new pic when I
created only because I created by people

324
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:56,850
created by people mining and creating
new blocks currencies issued currently

325
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,129
for every person who could generate a
block the rewards 25 bitcoins with a

326
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,909
network started the reward was fifty
bitcoins and next year is gonna be

327
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:10,210
twelve and a half so every four years
the reward hops and asymptotically

328
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,929
approaches the finite limit of 21
million that will never be exceeded ok

329
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:19,389
that's what mining is so its
distribution network so it is actually

330
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:23,240
possible that's roughly around the same
time to minors on the network will find

331
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,350
a valid solution to the next block and
what happened in that case well in that

332
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:32,178
case you have what's called a fork this
happens about once a day on average

333
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,860
what that means is that two people
broadcast the new block both of which

334
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,168
build on the last good luck here and in
that in that case what happens is the

335
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:44,159
big one network is temporarily split
what happens as everyone who sees this

336
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,220
blog first we'll try and extend this
blog bubbling up above it and everyone

337
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,090
who sees this blog for us will try to
extend this block now what that means is

338
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,928
that you have such a voting process
happening on the pic on network people

339
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:01,460
vote with their identities coin mining
and running a network synonymous and

340
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,230
Watkins free to join and leave you give
an identity what you vote with is your

341
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,730
passion power so if say whatever I
seventy-five hashing power is trying to

342
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,120
send this block and thirty this block it
is likely that next book will be fine

343
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,518
and will be extending this one here and
the Bitcoin protocol says that people

344
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,100
should always switch to try to extend
the longest blocked the one that most

345
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,299
amount of work put into it and because
you

346
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,769
because you know anyone else will do
that it is in your rationale interest

347
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:34,279
through the same because if you try to
extend this one and this will become

348
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:37,580
longer and longer people ignore your
blocks and your reward will be ignored

349
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,529
so just for your selfish interests it is
rational for you to orphan the block you

350
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:46,450
working on down here to give up on it
and join everyone else on this side of

351
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,869
the network over here and that's how pat
Quinn re-creates the synchrony between

352
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:53,559
the network and the speedway

353
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:58,570
what this also means in terms of how one
can attack the network is that if any

354
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,220
single actor just to amass more than 50%
of the entire hashing part of the

355
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,679
network what you could do as you could
split up the block chain from any point

356
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,399
onwards and decide what you want to put
these blocks now there are some limits

357
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:15,008
to this you can't put invalid
transactions in it because the

358
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:18,090
cryptographic suggests will no longer
match and the network will ignore that

359
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,869
the one thing you can do is you can
decide not to include transactions so if

360
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:26,549
you really wanted to you could produce
empty blocks and basically sense of

361
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:31,239
transactions this would cause a 51%
attack it's quite expensive because they

362
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:36,149
have the big one network is now in Ormus
but you couldn't do it the other problem

363
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:39,779
would be that would be detectable people
would notice 0 for no good reason the

364
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:42,830
miners are censoring transactions
something's wrong let's go investigates

365
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,480
and the other nice thing about pat Quinn
is that because it creates a beautiful

366
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,059
history he's blocked numbers you can go
back to any point in the Bitcoin history

367
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:56,249
and restart the network from a block
that we all agreed in fact there was a

368
00:26:56,249 --> 00:27:00,039
security problem found early on in
Bitcoin where the output of a

369
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:03,779
transaction to add up to be the same as
imports but it wasn't checking for

370
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:07,759
numeric overflow the someone managed to
create you know several billion Bitcoin

371
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,879
in a transaction by simply using the
overflow the outputs and the way that

372
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:15,998
was fixed was at the Bitcoin quartet's
got to get inside guys stop the

373
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:19,139
bloodshed from it let's go back to the
previous blog that we know is good and

374
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:23,399
go from there again that was many years
ago was only on the protocol because the

375
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:27,199
transaction histories immutable you can
go back and restore any block in the

376
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,909
case of 51% attack people probably to
say okay shot 256 which is the hashing

377
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:35,149
algorithm be concurrent users is
compromised somebody has amassed more

378
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:38,320
than 50% of the power it let's change
some other

379
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,090
hashing algorithm that's probably what
would happen but again this attack is

380
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,220
the most expensive one you probably
think of because it's just so much

381
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:51,100
community power so it going to work
requires only that you know half the

382
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,889
network is roughly being honest in what
they're doing okay so what does that

383
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:00,178
mean for a single transaction that means
a single transaction has the following

384
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,389
lifecycle what is first broadcast
network and not include any block it's

385
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:08,029
what we call on confirm transaction that
within a few seconds ascent of the

386
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:11,799
entire network and everyone can see the
transaction being broadcast when the

387
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:15,029
first miner to the block and it will
happen in about five minutes on average

388
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:18,649
because it takes 10 minutes to make a
blocking your randomly going to

389
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:23,860
broadcast it halfway through the process
and you get your transaction including

390
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:29,240
one block in the clintons this is called
won confirmation if someone does the

391
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,409
block on top of that block you get to
confirmations and three confirmations

392
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:33,450
and so on

393
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,929
as your transaction gets buried deeper
and deeper into the block chain the

394
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:39,940
Chancellor is will be able to
successfully for the network in the way

395
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,110
that we saw become lower and lower
exponentially so so what does that mean

396
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:50,850
for a merchant's well it means if you're
sending some coffee you can probably

397
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:55,158
accepts a single transaction because
it's quite hard to put the block chain

398
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,539
if you want a Ferrari you might want to
wait twenty thirty minutes before let

399
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:04,658
dry before court case I had some sort of
ability to foot the network so you can

400
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:10,639
choose any amount of 31 in terms of
accepting transactions so if a merchant

401
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:15,090
is being quite lacks and they accept
unconfirmed transactions what could you

402
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,970
in theory due to attack that merchants
well you can carry out something called

403
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,549
a double spend attack so in this example
alice is the attacker network currently

404
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:29,418
agrees that alice is the only holder of
the one that exists and bobcat have no

405
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:35,220
but concert hall now in this example Bob
Katter merchants and the connection

406
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,500
between their two nodes limits lower
than the way that Alice connects to them

407
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,299
so what else can do is Alice
simultaneously broadcast two

408
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:47,379
contradictory transactions to each of
them she compromise bobber Bitcoin and

409
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:48,908
promised aimed at quantico

410
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:53,539
at the same time and if they accept
those transactions are unconfirmed and

411
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:57,899
palaces managed to position itself the
network in this way that she can push

412
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:01,248
for direct her transactions directed by
Venkat which takes quite a bit of

413
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:05,889
analysis of the network and figuring out
which know it's connected to she

414
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:11,168
couldn't they are a double spin attack
and if bob cat immediately go and send

415
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:15,779
out the goods without any confirmations
and she could essentially get two of

416
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:22,349
whatever she's ordering now this this is
not a problem for biklin itself because

417
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:25,599
the next minor who create the block out
this cannot include both these

418
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,399
transactions these transactions contract
each other if you saw the block and put

419
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:33,539
both of these in the block everyone else
on that work will ignore your block

420
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:37,970
solution your award you will lose 25
declines because it's not ballot so it

421
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,849
is not in their interest to do something
stupid like that because you're putting

422
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:45,149
real hashing power on the line its cost
you some effort electricity do this so

423
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:49,570
it's just act rationally like i say this
is not you just have to carry out either

424
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:53,918
because you need to know exactly how
networks going to the network and so on

425
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,129
but it could in theory possible so in
practice merchants will accept higher

426
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:04,889
taxes if you buy a coffee but not if
you're buying a Lamborghini so ok let's

427
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:08,399
have a look at the structure a
transaction again so it can transaction

428
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,090
consists of two parts like data showing
schematically these you think of it like

429
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,820
this that is the transaction

430
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,168
a statement of intent saying I want to
send this particular pic on my own

431
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:23,700
person and you sign it with a signature
and this case Alice now remember from

432
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:33,059
then slide the signature has two parts
are now unfortunately the CBSA there is

433
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:38,869
a slight problem that allows someone to
take a valid signature RSS make a minor

434
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:44,049
mathematical mutation to the F compared
to the signature you take the negative

435
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:44,899
value and take it

436
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:47,889
modulus and it's not important to
understand what the mathematical

437
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:51,359
transformation is it simply important
that the way he said yes they work so

438
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,129
allows you to make a minor formatting
change the signature when you do this

439
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,510
you can only change the way that
signature looks you cannot change any of

440
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,810
this change any of this journal of
matches all you can do is slight change

441
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,260
of formatting of a signature and it
still valid

442
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,970
so how could we use that knowledge to
attack the network

443
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,180
well let's imagine the scenario let's
imagine alice is the big one exchange

444
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,850
and she has users and sometimes uses one
take their money out so lets the user

445
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:24,310
Bob wants to withdraw his one big one
from the exchange he says to allen's

446
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:29,360
please everyone but conjugates ok he go
bob here's the transaction I have signed

447
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,990
as Alice and your Bitcoin she tried to
send this to the network however Bob the

448
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:40,370
attacker has figured out which no Dallas
users to connect to network with and

449
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,909
what he does is he mad animal attacks
out essentially he at this point the

450
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,630
transaction being broadcast the network
he goes and changes it he goes and makes

451
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,830
a minor formatting changes that
indicates that benefit and that what

452
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:01,210
happens is this message is still valid
yet still are correct to say it's a

453
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,050
slightly different from its signature so
the network will go ahead and will

454
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,930
confirm this transaction and it'll all
go through everything is good bugs guys

455
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:13,240
back on now what does he goes out and
say hey wait a minute I never got my

456
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,730
money can you please check on this
transaction used to send out and about

457
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,200
issues if alice is foolish

458
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,840
she simply will take a hash of her
transaction ago oh that hash a kind that

459
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,330
come from anyone the network and if
she's very foolish she will not just

460
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,850
rebroadcast the same transaction should
choose the ballot she will generate a

461
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,669
different transaction there is a big
corner has not yet been spent and sends

462
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:41,590
it get into the network I guess what
does bob does exact same thing again and

463
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,179
if alice is extremely stupid she will
automate this process I never check any

464
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,360
this complaint just keep sending it over
and over and over again in fact the kind

465
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,750
of person who might do this would be
like someone who would try to implement

466
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:00,850
a site using PHP and they probably look
like this this was in fact the the way

467
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,620
that talks claim that their pic winds
were hacked they use transaction

468
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,120
malleability the protocol

469
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,159
and people stole money because the
automated this process up to three

470
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,679
sending transactions over and over again
and it caused the loss of over a half a

471
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,600
billion with the Bitcoin so yeah that
wasn't very good I should point out this

472
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,350
point that many researchers believe that
this is something convenient in the

473
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:26,100
protocol that markets has blamed the
problem on it's likely that were

474
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,399
actually an insider attack that monks
was actually insolvent long before this

475
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,730
happened but publicly the transaction
malleability explained as what they

476
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:39,800
blamed for this problem yet so if anyone
is looking to steal the exchanges are

477
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,669
pretty good targets ago after half a
billion dollars worth of becoming this

478
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:46,370
is the largest ever becoming heist in
history

479
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:51,509
this one actually peremptory got out of
business been there been other attacks

480
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,270
against exchanges earlier this year but
stamp is there another popular change

481
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,320
these days they were hacked as well

482
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,330
using transaction liability but they
lost about five million dollars they're

483
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,029
a bit more switched on when it comes to
security which is why they only lost

484
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:12,480
this small amount and and they're still
going but let's go back and look at man

485
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,920
the middle attacks even mention how this
can help reduce transaction malleability

486
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:26,790
attacks and won the problem is that
there is no inherent prevention for

487
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,100
mandela tax like there's no endpoint
validation like your account with us for

488
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,040
example it's a peer-to-peer network
you're connecting to random people on

489
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,880
the internet and you don't really know
anything about them so you could be

490
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,710
connected to any body and the way they
can get around the the peer-to-peer

491
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,080
traffic problem like the problem finding
your initial setup ears is that there is

492
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,509
this well-known list of DNS addresses
and when you start your wallet

493
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,200
it will resolve those addresses and they
always resolve to a a long list of

494
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,569
recent appearance on the network so that
should give you a list of like one or

495
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:06,210
two hundred IP addresses that you can
then connect so if an attacker is in the

496
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:12,740
position to influence your DNS or they
can just get in between you and one of

497
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,868
these IP addresses or all of them then

498
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:20,130
they can ensure that all of your traffic
goes through them and that's that's one

499
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,109
way of doing getting in the middle

500
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:30,299
there's another attack against Tory
users are going back to the transaction

501
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:34,089
the way you validate transactions I
showed you earlier there is a program

502
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:39,190
that gets executed there is a possible
denial of service attack against are you

503
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:47,829
repeatedly saying invalid transactions
and you force the execution to try and

504
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:51,349
validate them that will always fail and
the way because protect itself from that

505
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:56,019
is that anytime you say and more than a
hundred invalid transactions and your IP

506
00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:00,779
address will be banned for 24 hours so
the attack in stories to say and a whole

507
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:04,180
load of invalid transactions through the
Tor exit know it and get all the tour

508
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:11,009
exit nodes bands and then you run your
notes and getting through tour will have

509
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:16,049
to be connecting through either your
exit node or to your to your big day

510
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:19,259
going through your exit now then they
can attack your industry directly to

511
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:21,829
their big going there anyway so that's
one of the ways of getting in the middle

512
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:30,799
of a tour users the trouble with mandala
taxes that transaction malleability

513
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:33,538
thing that mitnick was talking about
there's not really much else you can do

514
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:34,880
once you're in the middle

515
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,019
you can prevent the user from sending
transactions but you can't really do

516
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:43,410
anything to steal their bickering and
their private key is still reasonably

517
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,960
secure on their computer doesn't give
you any accidents so you can create

518
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,710
transactions on their behalf

519
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:54,039
all you can do is stop them from sending
you steal anything

520
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:59,049
ok so in the last 12 briefly touch upon
some of the ways in which pic when

521
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:04,839
security is improving right now so it
works through a bunch of clowns upgraded

522
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:08,420
to a pic when improving proposal or a
bit so here's one that's actually going

523
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,489
to go right now this is to solve the
transaction value probability probably

524
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:15,759
talked about so there's already a known
solution to this basically the it's a

525
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:19,420
tightening up on the rules eg signatures
can be negative and there's a few other

526
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,140
places in the protocol allows similar
things like you can like nope at some of

527
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,700
the input argument that showed but it's
always the same idea you can make a

528
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,538
minor formatting changes transaction
that doesn't invalidate it and the

529
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:35,220
change the hash of it and here is
already bit 62 is already the proposed

530
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,058
solution of how to tighten up a concert
is no longer possible is not is not

531
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:43,539
being the code yet has not been released
yet but it is on his way to be happening

532
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:48,640
so that's gonna get taken care of
another way that because it is improving

533
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,118
is that in a normal transaction as we've
seen as only a single signature here so

534
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:57,430
only one private key to compromise on a
compromise alice's funds well biklin now

535
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,589
also has a possibility of saying funds
can be locked up in such a way that you

536
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,640
require more than one thing to do it you
can do like a scheme here but you say

537
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,868
you have to have at least two out of
three signatures on any transaction to

538
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:13,269
be able to spend these funds and what
that lets you do that lets you create

539
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:17,189
independent private keys have never ever
been on the same computer never on the

540
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,440
same machine that exist in different
parts of the world

541
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,509
different hard run different OS's and
transactions created Alice has to

542
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:27,480
independently side and sort of cat
before the transaction is valued at all

543
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,430
so that means the attacker has to
compromise multiple points at the same

544
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:36,049
time for this attack to work in fact
this is the solution that fits that went

545
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:39,230
to after they are five million dollars
he talked about whether use an

546
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:43,920
independent organization called it go
that will independently side transaction

547
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,400
and run them through much of risk
profiling things you could do things

548
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,470
like the other organization will only
sign them if that's you know less than

549
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:54,200
certain amount or if it looks dodgy
because of the way that the patterns are

550
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,930
happening in Europe taking too much out
one day it may stop it and go and say

551
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,239
wait a minute this looks wrong are you
sure you want to sign this another way

552
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,380
to pick on security is improving is that
people are like develop hardware well

553
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,950
it's the idea of hardware wallets is
that you would never ever let the

554
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,739
private key escape the hardware what you
what you can do is you can plug this

555
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:17,019
device into a laptop that could be
compromised the only thing laptop can do

556
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:21,049
is proposed a transaction to the to the
hardware and you have to physically

557
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:26,369
press YES or NO to add a signature to it
there's various schemes that have

558
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:30,549
noticed but they have pins and you can
use this in combination with multi sake

559
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:33,450
we're one of the suggested we produce
the hardware while at the other one is

560
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:39,589
on your Android device or somewhere else
but will become harder while it can also

561
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:43,349
look very differently this is an example
of a bit as an overlay onto a SIM card

562
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:49,619
that adds Bitcoin hardware functionality
to any dumb phone as an example

563
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,220
another way that people have been
talking in terms of improving the hard

564
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,500
way is to use trusted computing platform
that trusted platform modules this is

565
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,119
getting more common on hardware hardware
comes with these modules that will only

566
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:06,250
allow code that has a verified
cryptographic signature to execute and

567
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,450
only under those conditions will this
chip release the private key necessary

568
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:14,810
to sign a transaction so helpful there
as well

569
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:19,099
ok so lastly let's go through the things
we covered the talk this is a reminder

570
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:23,380
of how we saw signs the first wave
showed you was able to trick people

571
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:28,210
sending to you always attack the human
so he's just point another we can do it

572
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:32,810
is trying to slow down as a malware
always a favorite cross-site scripting

573
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:39,529
you can take advantage of people having
bad random number generators you can

574
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,930
just simply watch television until
someone shows you the private key you

575
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,390
can amass more than half of the entire
hashing power the network kind of

576
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,140
expensive

577
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,430
you can double spend of merchants are
waiting for transactions if you have

578
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,879
knowledge of the network setup and you
can exploit transaction malleability

579
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,549
while still possible to do that before
they fix it

580
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:26,200
okay thank you very much for coming to
talk

581
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:46,848
I'm not very familiar with this
presentation very basic question how do

582
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:49,640
I get these because I have to buy them
from somewhere you mentioned that there

583
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:55,890
is no central authority so I different
vendors that he can buy from ya so

584
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,810
there's there's plenty of exchanges out
there some better than others like we

585
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,609
showed a mean really should be the ones
I got tax there's multiple exchanges out

586
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:07,009
their existing different countries you
can you can sell things are picking up

587
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:12,460
now this is the chancellor of the UK
George Osborne using a pic on ATM is

588
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:21,099
putting in money and it gets real big
close out 2011 other option is always to

589
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:27,280
steal them to mind but coins that's
probably that's not that easy anymore

590
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,630
because it is modeled on goals in that
is limited but also on the way the goals

591
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,930
in mind in the early days anyone could
go to California stick their hand into a

592
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,970
stream and golden nuggets and that was
CPU mining that it got harder people had

593
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:43,509
to use graphics cards to mine it and as
the Bitcoin as it became harder and

594
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,970
harder and the Justice difficulty to
keep the blocks for 10 minutes now you

595
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:52,209
have to use special hardware basics
basically so that's what we're going to

596
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:55,690
do it I wouldn't recommend that to an
average user

597
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:02,360
thank you

598
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:10,240
$40 roughly what howard said I was at
work

599
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,680
ok so here is a graph that shows the
price of the ballot the price of Bitcoin

600
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:23,720
as maybe you guys can see this was the
Great Crash 2012 but here it went from

601
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:33,709
$35 a gloss over 90% with a $2 and corn
is a is like is like gold its its prices

602
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:38,400
only by supply and demand far as I know
there are no dodgy bankers in London who

603
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,550
fix this price every day so yeah it's
simply how to run it by how much you

604
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:47,030
want to sell now because big one is like
gold it has a slight periodic problem

605
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,260
where people get very excited about the
coin and the price goes up and people

606
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,760
look at you go oh my god the price going
up I must buy bitcoins and the price for

607
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,580
the fire people go oh my god is going up
by more and of course that's not

608
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:02,090
sustainable and then eventually crashes
and it happened a few times now this was

609
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:07,810
this crash happened to your when finally
collapsed it's been a bit much they were

610
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:12,210
around 200 now the hope is that as big
advances it will become more and more

611
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:17,560
stable less volatile and probably end up
looking a bit like gold gold 24 @ rates

612
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,600
than has periods where goes up but it
it's not as wild and crazy young big

613
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,930
toys 6 years old so we're hoping it'll
come down and be like oh but in the long

614
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,279
run it should appreciate in value simply
because of limited government money

615
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,430
keeps being printed quantative easing
programs are very popular around the

616
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,960
world right now the clinton have
quantities and is not possible to not

617
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,590
allow it

618
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:56,620
question this is the supply curve a pic
on we are around there are a lot of the

619
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,009
security of the bills on

620
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:04,860
big number of analysts people network
especially the minors so what will

621
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:09,370
happen when an op-ed cards have been in
mind what will happen to the security

622
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:12,830
model is this already planned or have to
adapt

623
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:17,529
question yes our plans so as we were
alluding to in the early days in the

624
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:21,730
beginning of work through that in the
beginning Bitcoin mining the block

625
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,200
reporters 50 big ones every block has
now been have 225 and it keeps going

626
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,189
down which looks like this so a bit
closer to rewards get from mining we

627
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,700
didn't mention the second the second is
transact transaction fees you can

628
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,620
include a small transaction fee
currently includes something like a

629
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,259
tenth of aus sent for any such
transaction to get including the block

630
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:47,160
chain and the hope as bad as we run out
as we approach the limit of 21 million

631
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,730
in the next hundred years that they
become very popular enough the

632
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,410
transaction fees will be enough to cover
the cost of mining so we should see a

633
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:58,129
balance remaining award subsidies of the
country found two transaction fees

634
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:05,540
taking over and securing the network by
the miners ok thank you very much
