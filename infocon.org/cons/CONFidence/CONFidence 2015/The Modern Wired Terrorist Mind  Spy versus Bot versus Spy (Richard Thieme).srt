1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
I just put their up for interest it does
say russians real said I Spy torture and

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,960
murder that was 1952 that this front
page headline occurred in the washington

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,800
post I make it better to that subject a
little bit this is who I am Richard

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,730
theme from theme works I've been
addressing the issues we're going to

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,510
talk about today for about twenty one
years and it occurred to me in the

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,859
nineteen eighties that because people
were going to be hooking computers to

7
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,890
each other and that a human being would
be connected to all the computers the

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,360
world was about to change in a dramatic
and radical way and I began focusing on

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,410
looking at all the issues that was going
to raise for people across the board and

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,569
this is what I discovered it's no wonder
how complicated things get what was one

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,600
thing leading to another the
entanglement of all aspects of our lives

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:06,090
from identity as individual people all
the way up to geopolitical structures

13
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,700
nation states and beyond has been
transformed and when we begin dealing

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,070
with security let me see if I can get
that off when we begin dealing with

15
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:24,449
security what we discover is that we are
walking out a mobius strip mobius strip

16
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,770
as you know looks like it has two sides
we don't want that this is gonna be fun

17
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,840
it only has one side you start walking
down one side and you wind up coming

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,110
back on the other side in you discover
there's no way to get off the möbius

19
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:48,170
strip this is what has happened since
ww2 in what we call on the United States

20
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,520
the national security state where the
practices of information management

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,939
disinformation misinformation
propagandizing on behalf of her points

22
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:06,658
if you begin to be the norm and the
national security state in the United

23
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,660
States in the late nineteen forties
which is where I focus began to emerge

24
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,049
with the institution of the CIA which
has grown now we have sixteen different

25
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:25,790
well-known publicized intelligence units
doing intelligence the CIA and the NSA

26
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,480
and CIA and so on and therefore it means
the information space which it is your

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,739
obligation and test to secure is not
always what we what we think it is and

28
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,580
and people change their thinking with a
great deal of difficulty it also has

29
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,710
become necessary in the national
security state to talk about things in a

30
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:58,340
kind of a different kind of way in order
to make sure that unlike Mr Snowdon you

31
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,410
still can travel freely and live where
you want to show you something you won't

32
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:12,000
be able to read this easily so I'm going
to tell you what it is in 2006 I wrote a

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,450
short story and it was called break
memory and I wrote one called zero day

34
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:26,339
roswell is your day roswell which this
is from and these are all from this

35
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,190
collection called mind games which looks
like this

36
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,329
well there's nothing like that that's an
iPad doing that you know how that works

37
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:44,300
there it is mind games is a collection
of short stories and the question you

38
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,810
can ask is why did I begin to write
short stories I was working with people

39
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:58,420
who were very much into the intelligence
world and they were very concerned after

40
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:05,570
911 about what had happened to their
task it had been changed radically in a

41
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:12,260
revolutionary way when orders came from
the White House to begin collecting in

42
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,820
effect everything everything and the
older people who had been part of it is

43
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,310
safe for many years

44
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,669
were shocked some of them because they
seem to violate the law and it seemed to

45
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:31,359
violate the Constitution and we met for
a number of years to discuss the ethical

46
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:39,000
implications of what was taking place
and I address this in a short story I

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
did that because one of the people in
our group said to me you know you can't

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,280
ever discuss of course what we talked
about in these meetings and then he

49
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,888
paused and he said unless you start
writing fiction fiction he said is the

50
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,870
only way you can now tell the truth I
realized this was universally true in

51
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,500
the national security state and I'll
give you an example a little bit of why

52
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,020
that has become true fiction is the only
way you can tell the truth so this this

53
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,310
is a photograph of one page from a short
story I didn't make it it was made by a

54
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,860
young hacker who noticed after Snowden's
revelations that this paragraph

55
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:30,650
paralleled many of the things had said
and for good reason it says among other

56
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,479
things

57
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:37,030
half the attractions out there the most
attractive attractions we made he's

58
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,750
speaking as an intelligence agent who is
on his deathbed we've partnered from the

59
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,620
beginning with the big guys do you see
we built remote access into the chips

60
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,289
into all the hardware that fact even
printers this wells and software this

61
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,419
now a platform for the business in the
world we go into telecom networks at the

62
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,820
front door we sniffed cables on the
ocean floor we have thousands of

63
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,419
redundant sensors to watch everything
and it goes on in that vein and he

64
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,789
noticed that I could write this in a
short story because it's my friend

65
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:13,960
advised this was mind mind candy candy
for the mind and entertainment is the

66
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:22,130
best way to move information into the
mind of society because all of your

67
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,520
filters your critical thinking is off
when you're watching a movie or reading

68
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,460
a book of fiction or even playing
multiplayer game in which various themes

69
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,390
have been embedded

70
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:40,030
which you assimilate or taken with
without thinking so we find ourselves in

71
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:46,929
a difficult position when we take a look
at the War of the information war that

72
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:54,050
is currently going on and that's what I
wanted to address specifically first

73
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,580
time I'm going to read a statement from
another work of fiction this is David

74
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,909
Ignatius who was part of the CIA for
many years and I know several people in

75
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,550
the CIA who write fiction because for
them to it is the only way you can tell

76
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,220
the truth everything that you write when
you leave the agency has to be vetted or

77
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,560
approved by the agency or you are not
allowed to print it that process is very

78
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,230
sometimes capricious and arbitrary
process and it often matters who you

79
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,550
know rather than what you know whether
what you write

80
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,650
gets out nation knew a lot of people and
so he could say things like this from

81
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:43,159
what I was told once said the secret
power that operates the world sounds

82
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,300
like a mafia and he says they are among
via the great choose the nineteen

83
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,870
nineties is that the world is run by
organized criminals we don't like to

84
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,470
admit that in the institution where I
work we like to pretend that the world

85
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,130
is run by governments which have neat
little boundaries and their own

86
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:07,260
currencies and stamps and intelligence
services and police forces those were

87
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:12,210
the rules of the game during the cold
war but the rules have changed

88
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,039
power has slipped from governments into
the hands of private organizations in

89
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,390
New York private currency traders have
more power over the dollar than the

90
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:26,469
federal reserve in russia the Mafia has
more power than the IRB in mexico the

91
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,970
drug cartels have more power than the
president in japan the politicians are

92
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,890
front the real powers helped make
corporations in the ACA's the same in

93
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,720
France real power around the world does
not reside with governments any longer

94
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,750
but with private interests real power he
concluded his secret power

95
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,480
our so if that's the world in which we
live

96
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,730
then it behooves us to be very very
mindful mindful and alert and conscious

97
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,900
of how we pursue information and then
when we get bits and pieces of

98
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,790
information how we connect it to other
pieces in order to build a bigger and

99
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,800
bigger picture because ignatius is
really telling the simple truth let me

100
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,099
give you an example from the United
States I was doing a talk not too long

101
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:26,290
ago for the FBI was 33 of our states had
a conference together and I i mentioned

102
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:32,360
that one of the consequences of the
computer revolution in the aggregate in

103
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,130
total is that boundaries which define
our identities have gotten very

104
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:47,160
amorphous very blurry very porous very
open you see an identity is simply the

105
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,370
way you put a boundary around yourself
and present yourself from within it you

106
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:58,430
define yourself and the boundaries
around individuals and nations nation

107
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:08,969
states have have gone liquid they have
gone into mist and new emergent

108
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:16,420
properties unite the arbiters of power
as it Nations said in transnational or

109
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:23,430
supranational organizational structures
which don't even have names we don't

110
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,489
know how to refer to them we certainly
don't vote for them

111
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:34,050
example that I gave it my talk to the
FBI was that the CIA was originated in

112
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:41,630
1947 I believe it was an agency that
could do whatever it really could do

113
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,800
anywhere in the world outside the United
States but it was prohibited from

114
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,949
functioning in that way inside the
United States

115
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,450
the FBI on the other hand was a police
organization

116
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,230
Bureau of police and it was commissioned
to function

117
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:06,630
only within the United States and not
outside but as a result of the changing

118
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,870
boundaries as a result above all of the
I T revolution and other factors which

119
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,710
have transformed our relationships with
each other around the world the CIA now

120
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,780
operates inside the United States for
example in close partnership

121
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,250
counterterror with the New York police
force are with the USS Marshals Service

122
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:34,170
and the FBI now has offices all over the
world and operates globally this results

123
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:41,020
in some changing behaviour I said that
we used to be able to come out on our

124
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:47,310
nation our nationality are identity from
our nation and nationality to tell us

125
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:53,449
how to behave but now the power and
influence that genuinely changes alters

126
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,440
or motivates our behavior comes from
these other sources these transnational

127
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,230
sources it when I said that the head of
the Chicago office the FBI said bingo

128
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,630
bingo that's how I know I'm onto
something he said that's exactly what I

129
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,470
am finding he said we used to be able to
ask people to cooperate with us

130
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,580
Americans that is on the basis of
patriotism and their loyalty to us and

131
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,420
now he said what I often hear is I would
like to help you but and that but is the

132
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,910
proof of what I just said that but is a
way of saying but there are other

133
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,520
sources of power and influence that
shape and frame my behavior and motivate

134
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,370
me and therefore the large for example
corporations in the world like Microsoft

135
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:50,840
or Apple or Sony or you name them you
know their names

136
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,490
large corporations are not nation state
corporations we have a bank called the

137
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,040
bank of America but it's not the Bank of
America it's in the world like Citigroup

138
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,480
has 70,000 employees in dozens of
countries all over the world their

139
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,209
global transnational structures and so I
saw a wonderful book

140
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,670
mark berry wrote in Australia call
Jennifer government in which people

141
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,170
recognize that the source of their
identity came so much more from who they

142
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,759
work for them from their country that
they changed their surnames so Jennifer

143
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:33,319
government Robert Nike Bob Microsoft
were the names of people because that

144
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:38,040
had more to do with who they were so
someone so long ago the weakest link in

145
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,589
the security chain is the definition of
the problem and the definition of the

146
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:49,220
problem is often not what we think it is
and I find that this is also true of

147
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,649
identity the weakest link in who we
think we are fundamentally is the

148
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:59,759
definition of who we think we are and
it's not who we often think we are on

149
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:07,050
the basis of twentieth century thought
the way we were framed informed by prior

150
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:14,490
cultural and social factors now you know
this you should know this better than

151
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,459
anyone I have some family who came from
poland pay very close attention

152
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:26,549
history you know the narrative of
history is a weapon and how utility

153
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:30,319
ourselves and how you tell it to others
will determine how they think of

154
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:37,189
themselves and with whom they identify
in my family there was a joke my great

155
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:43,299
grandmother told of a time when she was
a little girl in eastern Poland and she

156
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:49,600
read into the house and said mama mama
we're not russians anymore now where

157
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,350
polls with the border changed and the
response came back thank God I couldn't

158
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:02,499
have stood another Russian winner that's
a test to see if my english is doing

159
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:08,889
alright so who we think we are

160
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:15,399
is something you know more deeply if
there were mostly young people here but

161
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:22,019
if they were older people the specter of
memory with shadow their awareness of

162
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,760
how their identity from the thirties and
the forties and

163
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,000
fifties and the sixties and so on has
changed radically as a result of these

164
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,280
emergent structures that are new so this
defines how we wage war in the

165
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,010
information space security is a
wonderful name for an industry which is

166
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,110
selling something that it can never
completely deliver that means you'll

167
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:53,440
have jobs forever as long as you call it
security because everyone wants security

168
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,330
will you know the gate is locked but the
gate is not secure fragmented operations

169
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,680
are being run for social media I'm going
to talk a little about the russians and

170
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,050
about Isis you know the forms attacks
can take there are four distinct kinds

171
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:18,359
physical on physical physical and
digital digital and physical and digital

172
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,940
art digital and who wages these attacks
you have your own units and your own

173
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:33,900
specialized cadres of people who engage
in warfare and counter warfare on the

174
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,829
levels of information but more and more
they are mercenaries they come from the

175
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,980
places that could pay them in the first
place as it they should said which means

176
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,000
from cartels are from mafias from
organized crime said they aren't

177
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,750
creating and executing a PT's or what we
call advanced persistent threats that

178
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:59,510
word in america security world is almost
as disreputable as cyber but you know

179
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:05,699
what it means it means something as an
execution of a detective doesn't doesn't

180
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,920
ever quit when they do this

181
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:17,250
ATT's s contract work including creating
arsenals of payloads for future use

182
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:24,000
so the waging of cyber war and the
building of information warfare weaponry

183
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,810
parallels the physical world where we
have mass more weaponry then we need and

184
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:35,100
therefore where it becomes essential to
use it up so that we can make money

185
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,370
making more it became clear that one of
the beneficiaries

186
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,739
of the Vietnam War was Bell Helicopter
because every time a helicopter went

187
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:50,480
down and there were about 500 of them
that went down during vietnam they had

188
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,220
to make another one so the question of
who who profits really really kind of

189
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:04,140
matters and it's difficult to keep in
mind what security really is let me give

190
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:12,510
you a quote from this from someone that
I i do pretty well he said the problem

191
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,179
is in computer security to tell the
truth

192
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:20,260
one has to know I hope I don't offend
anyone by saying this because I'm

193
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,050
quoting someone this is not me this is a
hacker I'm certain that a hacker this is

194
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,399
a security professional

195
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,860
that I know well he says the problem is
to tell the truth you have 21 not be a

196
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:39,770
vendor not selling any solution and to
be willing to spill the beans tell the

197
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:45,750
truth about how much you get owned there
are very few people he said who are

198
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,550
willing to get up and say I work
security my job is to prevent intrusions

199
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:59,389
weekend owned a lot so I fail I really
suck at my job sometimes it is really

200
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:05,300
really bad and this is how we deal with
it that's a different version of

201
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:12,450
security they were usually see other
material that people put out russian

202
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:18,760
organized crime as you know is protected
by global big crimes and by the state

203
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,940
security apparatus the FSB having its
segued from the KGB in a in a kind of

204
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:31,950
seamless way the russian influence in
the Baltic states is similar to what the

205
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,559
Romans built many years ago what did the
Romans discover was the most important

206
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,090
thing about building sustaining and
maintaining an empire it was wrote it

207
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:48,149
was road said roads in the Crimea roads
into the ukraine roads across the

208
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,960
frontier that applies to digital roads

209
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,950
as well that's what AP teens are they
are hundreds of roads into complex

210
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,200
systems which once you take them put you
inside what we used to consider their

211
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,960
perimeter but there is now no longer a
perimeter so how you talk about this is

212
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,580
itself the weapon I'm telling some of
the harsh truth in order to say we have

213
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,629
to begin with reality because if you did
not begin with reality

214
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,960
you have to spend a lot of time and
effort to get to it and then you've

215
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,780
wasted energy and time going from
unreality to reality so that you can

216
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,360
begin to have a sensible meaningful
conversation Philip K Dick great writers

217
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:38,310
said reality is that which would you no
longer believe in it refuses to go away

218
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:47,960
and that's what I try to stay with so
what is happening in reality Isis is

219
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,190
building cohesion and identity by
targeting youth through manipulation and

220
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:59,060
through images we have well-meaning
hackers who want to fight back in the

221
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:07,050
States vigilante hackers Anand and their
legions of cooperative supporters but

222
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,919
hackers are effective in this war only
if they are integrated into a bigger

223
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:18,690
strategy otherwise it's very clear that
using Isis an example with 35,000 tweets

224
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,290
a day you're playing what we call
whack-a-mole you no one comes up here

225
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,950
take down the video comes up here to
take down the video comes up here that's

226
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,520
a very effective way to do it but it's
even worse than that we have to be clear

227
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,000
about how it is that the national
security state globally really operates

228
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,100
I was sitting with a friend once upon a
time when a document came across my

229
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,110
computer and it mentioned that vigilante
hackers who are attacking al Qaeda

230
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:55,360
websites with a vengeance as in the al
Qaeda websites showed themselves to be

231
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,580
surprisingly resilient and elastic they
would come back up very quickly and they

232
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,330
didn't think they could do that so well
well my friend

233
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,530
and that I was sitting with happened to
be a career point the NSA and he just

234
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:18,000
smiled and he said look like those guys
don't know how to code we have to go

235
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,920
behind the scenes in rewrite the code
for their websites and we have to

236
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:29,270
install perimeter defenses to make sure
the vigilantes do not take down the

237
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,340
al-qaida websites that's
counterintuitive but why was it that he

238
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,030
said that because it's much more
important if the website is a waterhole

239
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,940
you want to watch the animals go to it
you want to watch where they drink and

240
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,410
then you want to watch where they go
when they leave the waterhole the only

241
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,180
waited too great a cell is by attacking
the units of the cell that make up the

242
00:22:53,180 --> 00:23:04,570
network excuse me so the units that make
up the network are people links in the

243
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,110
chain and you can do this by attacking
this lake that is very unimportant and

244
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,149
making it seem much bigger and more
important or attacking and importantly

245
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,290
and making it seem much smaller so that
the energy that has to be continually

246
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:22,879
put into maintaining the network of
information and its flow is considerably

247
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,250
more than it would otherwise be so
things are often not what they seem

248
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,070
in fact things are seldom what they say
and in the national security state

249
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:41,070
that's even truer so how are the
russians doing their job today I would

250
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,939
say they're doing it very well and we
have seen this before we have seen this

251
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,590
in the nineteen thirties coming from the
other direction not from you our West

252
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:59,159
but from the east we have seen
ideological saturation of the russian

253
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,300
people to such a degree that there is an
80 percent approval rating for all the

254
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:10,669
adventurism that is underway right now
when you are saturated with ideological

255
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,810
propaganda you can't resist it

256
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:18,840
nato has monitors which have to do have
to read

257
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:25,139
stuff in order to keep up and how the
distortions are probably gated and what

258
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,290
we've discovered is that those who read
what the Russians are putting out watch

259
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:36,540
the television programs read the
newspapers etcetera in order to know how

260
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,510
the russians are distorting the
information space even though they know

261
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,650
that's their job is to identify
disinformation inevitably they

262
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:51,500
assimilate take in what they are reading
and they themselves have to be

263
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,070
periodically debriefed in order to help
them realize that they have come to

264
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:04,830
believe the very propaganda they are
charged for tests to monitor because the

265
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,639
fact is that when you see a movie it
looks like reality and your brain does

266
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,460
not make it significant distinction
between what it sees and what it thinks

267
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:23,520
it sees it has to treat it like reality
if it looks like reality and it's so

268
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,510
they do a wonderful job and entertaining
way of providing the news

269
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:36,980
fiction as I said is the only way to
tell the truth they do that expertly and

270
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,080
did it goes down easily

271
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,550
propaganda is always some truth spliced
with some half truth spiced with some

272
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:52,210
lies and that is you eat the truth it's
kind of like the fat around him

273
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:57,270
you get the allies as well and it makes
it much more easy to assimilate and

274
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:06,320
integrate with what you already believe
so the russians for example in Sweden

275
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,530
talking to people from the
counterintelligence group in Sweden

276
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:16,830
ago there are pro-russian bloggers in
Sweden actually there are dozens and

277
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:23,250
dozens of bloggers who are pro-russian
and paid to be so in Sweden but they use

278
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,310
only one percenter if you go to the blog
it looks like it's just one person

279
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,750
bugging but it's very many people

280
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:37,900
know that on the web you tend to believe
what you see but you know it isn't true

281
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,570
let me give you an example many years
ago when I start writing about this so

282
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,260
long ago that when you got an email you
thought it came from someone in your

283
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,330
town or city that's how long ago was
people didn't realize that email could

284
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,649
come from anywhere and i was just
beginning to write globally in the early

285
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,970
nineties because the internet made it
available people forget that in America

286
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,890
1993 that was the first year you could
do something commercial on the Internet

287
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:11,620
it had not been legal to do business on
the internet before 1993 and that was

288
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:17,280
only twenty-two years ago and so I began
to locate right markets for my writing

289
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,690
in England and in South Africa where I
wrote for three years and Australia

290
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:28,490
Canada and so on and so what in England
red apiece I did on background against

291
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:34,830
and bigger detective online and finding
things out that was a new idea that now

292
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,720
everybody is a detective and a
counter-intelligence agency so I he said

293
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,030
he had read it in an English magazine
published in London so he assumed I

294
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:47,090
lived in London and he said in email
saying come over after work for a pint

295
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:52,040
we'd like you to work for us and I said
what if you got well this turned out to

296
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,020
be a global public relations company and
he said we would like to see you do

297
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,310
brandy fence on the web for our clients
and I said oh so you mean for if for

298
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:08,000
example their tobacco company you want
me to set up a website defending the

299
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,460
company he said no no no no we want you
to set up a website attacking the

300
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:18,820
company and then we'll give you justice
snuff enough information to make it

301
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,010
credible but nothing that will
incriminate or really penalize are quiet

302
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:29,890
and that way those who want to attack
the company will go to that website and

303
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:36,540
we will collect them my words were like
real birds in a digital cage and when

304
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:42,178
you are a real bird collected in a group
online you don't see because you can

305
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,200
flap your wings and fly so you have the
illusion of freedom

306
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,789
and you don't see that all they have to
do that is moved the cage and all the

307
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:56,669
birds in the cage move along with it and
that's what they offered that any said

308
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:00,889
we want you to go into what we called
Usenet groups then some of you who know

309
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:04,639
the history of the internet will
recognize what he used that group is we

310
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:09,559
used to said little messages to each
other and they would form a list a novel

311
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:14,539
idea that he said we want you to create
multiple identities under multiple names

312
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:19,639
and that way you can sway the
conversation or if it gets too close to

313
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:27,129
something dangerous troll undermine it
make it about something else and the

314
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,250
problem is that people go on the
internet the people I know who are what

315
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:38,120
I called normal people not like you guys
normals don't distinguish between what

316
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,789
seems to be true and what is true

317
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:46,580
insecurity we do not have the luxury of
of doing that so that means have

318
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:52,320
influenced activities are protected and
legal in democracies and not allowed in

319
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,590
dictatorships so you can do in Sweden
you can do in poland you can do in the

320
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,850
United States where you cannot do in
russia because it's not tolerated and

321
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:07,389
they don't fool around you know I know
young hacker in israel is very good he

322
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:11,639
developed a program you know when you go
back to Israel as you you you have the

323
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:16,879
right to return in your given like
$10,000 it was then for a year and

324
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,240
settled and helped and of course this is
a great opportunity for fraud

325
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,590
all you have to do is create multiple
identities of people coming back and

326
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:31,059
collect $10,000 per identity so this
fellow good well-meaning hacker created

327
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:35,269
a program to detect those fraudulent
identities and distinguish them from

328
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:40,399
real identities and a knock came on his
door one night and there were two very

329
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,689
large Russian gentleman and one of them
was silent to the other said we don't

330
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:54,010
like your program and he said you know I
don't like my program and they said why

331
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,020
don't you destroy your program and he
said

332
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,690
why don't I destroyed my program in
other words the russians have a very

333
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,890
simple way of approaching these matters
to very large gentlemen show up and that

334
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:13,480
takes care of the problem it's not
sophisticated mind washing brainwashing

335
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:20,110
what's going on it's the same old
thuggery but it's done at a very

336
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:26,459
sophisticated level I'm going to see if
I have time I'll try to make this quick

337
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,030
but its I think extremely interesting
when you talk about brainwashing you

338
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:36,220
probably have heard of the manchurian
candidate in the nineteen fifties the

339
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,650
United States became very alarmed at the
number of american servicemen and women

340
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,620
being turned by the Russians and the
Chinese when they were captured during

341
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,310
Korea during the Korean War and they
became convinced that there were

342
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:55,159
sophisticated methods of brainwashing
being undertaken it we needed to know

343
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,630
what those were there was a big article
written by an investigative reporter in

344
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:06,410
the United States about brainwashing and
it got the word and the concept into the

345
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:13,580
mind of american society and so the
Americans taking as their stimulus this

346
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:19,399
well-written article about brainwashing
began exploring how you could do it so

347
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,920
through the fifties and sixties we
develop programs that are now notorious

348
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:29,650
Project Blue Bird artichoke MKULTRA and
the rest of the names we have given them

349
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,960
in which we experimented with human
beings sometimes doing horrific are

350
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,980
lethal things to them we did it in
Montreal in order to have possible

351
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,430
deniability for the CIA the conducted
the experiments which sometimes

352
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:48,640
attempted to completely wipe the
consciousness of an unwitting volunteer

353
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,000
and see if it could be replaced with a
Manchurian Candidate type cut

354
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,990
consciousness we only know that we did
all these things because when the

355
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,880
director of CIA ordered all reference to
these programs destroyed they overlooked

356
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,990
one big box of 50,000 financial
documents which have been painstakingly

357
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,400
reconstituted to show the narrow

358
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,670
so we know what was done what we
discovered was that you couldn't do

359
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:20,860
these things there were no exotic
sophisticated technologies then for

360
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,679
brainwashing the russians did with the
russians always did and the Chinese were

361
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:30,020
doing with the chinese always did I you
can turn people at the NSA friends said

362
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:35,889
the reason we have compartmentalization
is because everybody talks when they get

363
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:41,150
you they do things to you and you talk
and everybody knows that therefore we

364
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,900
have to limit what you know because you
will tell them everything you do know so

365
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,960
meanwhile the manchurian candidate was
the name given to this person

366
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,310
brainwashed and sit back to United
States and it became very popular here's

367
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,700
a movie with Frank Sinatra how can you
not believe a movie with Frank Sinatra

368
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:07,270
at it and it became the subject of
non-fiction the search for the

369
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,139
Manchurian Candidate the CIA and mind
control

370
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:16,889
let me just tell you where it wound up
we decided that we needed to protect our

371
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,699
people against these terrible message of
mind control that we ourselves that

372
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:27,850
devised and so a manual was written
called Operation the cool part manual it

373
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:34,299
was written in order to put our own
people during preparation through the

374
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,210
very interrogation techniques that we
feared would be used on the ie torture

375
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,179
of various sorts in order for them to
learn how to resist torture and then

376
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:49,550
after 911 when we needed someone to head
our own interrogation program we chose

377
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:55,929
the person who had written that manual
which was based in turn on what the CIA

378
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:02,100
and others had done which had not worked
and that resulted in some of the

379
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:08,009
disasters we experienced have
experienced double Ghareeb was one

380
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:13,870
before the photographs above a career
which stupid people made were published

381
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:19,910
no one had been beheaded in iraq it was
only after Abu Ghraib and our own

382
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,859
photographs were published that that

383
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,820
had been taken that had taken place so
the man who wrote that Kubrick manual

384
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:35,250
was put in charge of interrogation which
resulted in torture torture of the

385
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:40,850
people we captured on the grounds that
we could find out better that way what

386
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:46,980
was being planned the head of the
Supreme Court scalia in america even

387
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:54,100
cited Jack Bauer the fictional hero of
the television program 24 as an example

388
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:00,319
of why we ought to do this no one would
incriminate ER or prosecute Jack Bauer

389
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,320
would they have prevented the terrorist
attack and are you could say as earth to

390
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:11,100
scalia Jack Bauer's fiction but fiction
is the only way important choose are

391
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,670
disseminated these days into the mind of
society more people believe in Jack

392
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:21,470
Bauer then believed in Joe Biden more
people know who Jack Bauer is that know

393
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:26,080
who Joe Biden is so let me conclude this
story by just pointing out the important

394
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,370
fact that investigative reporter in the
nineteen fifties who popularized the

395
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:39,890
idea of brainwashing was a CIA agent and
in fact he wrote that article not

396
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,970
because brainwashing was real which he
had no knowledge of because it didn't

397
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:51,250
exist but in order to escalate the
funding of the cold war and weaponry on

398
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,720
behalf of the military-industrial
complex that was his task he wrote a

399
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,169
false article placed it in the new york
times and and as a result a whole chain

400
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,860
of events subsequently issued from there
at about a concept that was frightening

401
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:14,520
and numerous glowed with terrible
implications called brainwashing that

402
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,060
never existed in the first place and
that had been written about for an

403
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:24,040
ulterior purpose which too was used to
raise more money to fund the weaponry

404
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,600
the cold war in the nineteen fifties and
that's just what happens two articles in

405
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,740
the information space which is why you
have to be extraordinary careful and a

406
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,330
counterintelligence agent yourself in
order to have some say

407
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:40,870
sense of what's going on because the
battlefield today in the global

408
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:45,970
structures in which we live is the mind
of society and the arsenal is

409
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:51,279
information and how it is manipulated
and how it is disseminated and how it is

410
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,150
reinforced is is critical to what we do
with it

411
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:03,580
sometimes those articles I think 10
minutes ok I'm just getting to my

412
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:11,710
introduction so I'm gonna do three hours
of work in 10 minutes to show you a

413
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:23,600
picture but it's ok on one side of the
screen you see Iraq and on the other

414
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,450
side you have a little fuzzy mouse thank
you

415
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:35,299
just a cheap shot right i would tell the
whole story why these two are juxtaposed

416
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,070
but I will tell you that the gentleman
on the right is Alexander Haig who is a

417
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,590
general and became secretary of state
and he became very alarmed when he read

418
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:51,030
a story The New York Times about a book
that illuminated how much the KGB at

419
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,850
that time was supporting global
insurrection around the world through

420
00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:00,850
terrorism and he held a press conference
demanding that the CIA look into it and

421
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:06,490
counter the nefarious attempts of the
KGB to undermine every legitimate

422
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:12,080
movement all over the world he was very
impulsive you may remember that would

423
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,590
Reagan was shot he popped up he said I'm
in charge don't worry and then people

424
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:22,700
said you know you're not your number
five balloonists therefore people ahead

425
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:28,060
of you who are in charge and only if
they are shot will you be in charge and

426
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:34,570
if they're all shot we will make sure
one more shot you can count on it so he

427
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,620
got very excited and insisted the CIA
take a look at this

428
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,250
the CIA did this is what the CIA
discovered because it discovered what it

429
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:48,450
had already known he had read this about
this book in The New York Times

430
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:55,470
very very good night the book is based
on an article written by investigative

431
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,868
reporters in New York Times they took
their lead from an article published in

432
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:03,089
a small Italian newspaper and to make
the story short the small Italian

433
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:08,430
newspaper was a proprietary the CIA and
the article was written by the CIA as

434
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:14,310
propaganda and put in the article to
steer up exactly what God stirred up the

435
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:18,910
belief that the KGB was fostering these
various terroristic attacks around the

436
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:24,589
world which they were not but he didn't
know that and so the information had

437
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:29,420
moved all the way from a bogus article
in Italian newspaper written by and

438
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,070
place by the CIA all the way up to the
New York Times and a book to the

439
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,200
Secretary of State calling a press
conference so the CIA could come back

440
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,640
six months later and said we've
investigated thoroughly and we've got it

441
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,990
we've got your back don't worry about it

442
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,500
well there's nothing to worry about in
the first place because it wasn't

443
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:54,599
happening and that's the danger of
misunderstanding the way blow back as we

444
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,670
call it

445
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:01,990
information that we place all over the
world for other purposes

446
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:09,578
follow the money is the usual rule can
can wind up like that I had put this on

447
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:15,190
the screen when we came in it interested
me that there was in 1952 articles like

448
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,960
russians real satellites by torture and
murder but the reason I had as I do a

449
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,920
whole talk at all just show you these if
you want to see these afterward I always

450
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,130
have a few if somebody wants to buy what
would you sell them inside these sounds

451
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:34,130
like so much more than $1 but I was part
of a team that wrote this book huge book

452
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,089
it's in 65 university libraries around
the world and it's called UFOs in

453
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:45,869
government historical inquiry what our
team illuminates is the government and

454
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:51,240
how the government responded to UFOs
over fifty or sixty years from the

455
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,129
1940's to the nineteen eighties the
other book his mind games which you

456
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,740
could look at as well that short story
collection

457
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,979
wheel for true over 50 years in order to
show that the practices of cover and

458
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:09,520
deception were effectively applied to
the domain of UFOs which the government

459
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,590
knew I'm not saying we know what they
are I'm not speculating are booked is

460
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:17,580
not speculate the reason it's so solid
is because it has over a thousand

461
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,440
footnotes pointing almost a thousand
pointing to government documents or

462
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,740
other primary documents the data in the
book is bulletproof it's a work of

463
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,700
history

464
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,890
focusing on how the government
interpreted the threat to national

465
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:37,250
security which was primarily reports of
UFOs rather than the phenomena itself

466
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,500
let's leave it at that

467
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:44,700
without going into detail and therefore
began to damp down the phenomena itself

468
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:50,819
this was one of the triggering events
that caused that 1952 July this is the

469
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,740
washington post this is not some slugged
newspaper this is a headline in the

470
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,359
washington post the fact is that I'll
just do these quickly the fact is St

471
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,770
Alexandria could set that's the Miami
Herald spotted saucers I'm just showing

472
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:10,410
you real news because in the early
fifties in late forties americans got

473
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:16,310
through the medium which said by using
that medium these newspapers this is

474
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:21,220
knows this is something you should be
aware of but once the decision was made

475
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:25,490
in the early fifties in light of serious
events over Washington which I won't

476
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,270
have time to go into you can look at the
YouTube video of a talk at DEFCON two

477
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:33,730
years ago on the on the book it on the
subject they decided they needed to do

478
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:40,570
something else and this is what they
wound up doing using tabloids USCNN's

479
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:45,660
found a south pole burning up our ozone
it when you juxtapose that with hooker

480
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:51,279
gives birth to triplets one black one
white one Chinese even though I don't

481
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,030
know about Poland but in america 80%
will believe that top headline then you

482
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:01,740
said there's civil that's ridiculous
therefore that must be ridiculous and

483
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,810
therefore we can't rely on the national
inquirer for the truth

484
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:11,670
the question five minutes ok the
question then becomes

485
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,440
where did the national inquirer come
from diary told you that the CIA had

486
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,640
placed a bogus story in an Italian
newspaper by the KGB but they're the

487
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,859
fifties and sixties the CIA appointed
himself as a ministry of culture because

488
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:27,299
we didn't have what they counteract the
Russian Ministry of Culture in soviet

489
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:32,950
socialist realism in literature and art
and lifted all boats the whole

490
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:37,828
information space globally became an
outpost the CIA published over a

491
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:42,710
thousand books covertly it made movies
like animal farm covertly arranged for

492
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:48,549
the publication of Doctor Zhivago and
the Soviet Union covertly and it's

493
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:53,079
sponsored intellectual periodicals the
one I knew best was encounter in England

494
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:56,510
which are about 20 years was the
bleeding non communist left periodical

495
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:01,319
in the world for intellectuals and it
was from first to last a CIA operation

496
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:05,058
funded through the Rockefeller
Foundation the Ford Foundation and other

497
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:09,410
proprietary foundations that existed in
a balloon with letterheads of important

498
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:14,710
people who are glad to give their names
to this patriotic enterprise well in

499
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:19,369
1953 they sponsored not only these
legitimate things but they also created

500
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:24,450
some dis- reputable periodicals for the
purpose of placing stories in them which

501
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,520
would immediately killed the story which
was so placed so the question becomes

502
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,490
for people interested in history when
did the national enquirer start and it

503
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:37,348
was 1953 and then the next question is
who started it

504
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:41,740
his name was Jean pope Generoso Pope the
question then is what what did he do in

505
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:48,328
1952 it's in his resume he was doing
psychological operations for the CIA is

506
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:52,079
what he was doing did he make money
because this was a money-making

507
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,069
operation of business not until the
1960's for many years he didn't make

508
00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:01,750
money lost money every year so hard to
keep the national inquirer afloat while

509
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,520
hundreds of thousands of dollars came to
him through frank costello the head of

510
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,740
the Mafia family in New York in cash
every year to sustain that in when he

511
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:17,290
died did this person publishing this
nefarious stuff who scandalized America

512
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:22,450
who who spoke at his funeral was the
eulogy was given by Melvin Laird who was

513
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:25,129
the secretary of defense

514
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:31,170
his links never quit and then you can
even ask did UFO stories in the enquirer

515
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:35,160
sell the story the answers not really
because every week they had a bulletin

516
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,000
board on the wall in the office of the
National Enquirer showing the headlines

517
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,059
and how circulation fluctuated according
to different kinds of stories it was

518
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:49,299
data mining before its time so they knew
very well the stories about celebrities

519
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:55,450
and medical issues and things like that
so much better but the one article that

520
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,980
was all over and over again included UFO
stories not because they sold more

521
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:04,930
papers but for whatever reason you might
imagine the point I'm just trying to

522
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,740
make is 0 for heaven's sakes be very
very careful when you encounter

523
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:16,299
information because the soviets for
example do entire series of Science and

524
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:23,049
aimed these at think tanks they used in
france attacks by seeding false premises

525
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:28,900
into complex arguments with the
intention of helping people arrived at

526
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:34,670
false conclusions this is all done for
what we call reflexive control to make

527
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:40,759
the other not even realize what is
happening because what you act on taking

528
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:46,789
in a determination feels to you like
voluntary behaviors like you are doing

529
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:52,819
it for good reasons rather than having
had a context created which shapes in

530
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:58,109
frames informs you because the context
becomes content and the inventors of

531
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:03,960
public relations in like 80 Bernays back
in the fifties in america do this they

532
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,450
changed the context and then the content
would follow and that's what reflexive

533
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:15,160
control of a population really means if
you can alter what someone believes

534
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,859
fundamentally to be true it becomes the
foundation of their house of information

535
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:25,288
and if you control the paradigm or model
of reality within which people live and

536
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:29,829
move and have her there being you don't
need to worry about the answers to

537
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:34,119
questions because you determine what
questions can even be asked in the first

538
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,650
place so to go back to this silly
example which is

539
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:46,550
silly at all you mentioned UFOs and
people scoff and say come on come out

540
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:52,620
but we knew we do it was really we knew
was really the forties we knew it

541
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:59,080
re-trial has been real it israel we knew
that and we document that so the best

542
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:06,130
way to attack something people hired in
real plain sight is to ridicule really

543
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:09,930
cures a very effective way of
undermining the credibility of a human

544
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:15,799
being like myself or someone else
without even touching the arguments

545
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,130
they're making without addressing what
they're saying is true and if you

546
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,090
fundamentally undermine their
credibility like the national enquirer

547
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:28,570
that anything they say is going to be
rejected as conspiracy theory renovated

548
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,410
does cover and deception operation since
there are three pillars for cover and

549
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,910
deception

550
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:42,009
inclusion this direction and ridicule
illusion means the creation of events

551
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:47,010
pseudo events pseudo environments in the
mind of society in which people

552
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:54,070
nevertheless believe as if they are real
it is an industry and it is global to

553
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:58,200
sleight of hand means well when
something is visible and you can't hide

554
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:04,250
it make people look over here we have a
person in America called paris hilton

555
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,420
you ever heard of that person paris
Hilton is a non-entity who is

556
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,970
essentially as Costa meaning this as a
purposeful human being can get in the

557
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:19,899
way she's living her life almost almost
done human because there is nothing but

558
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,360
shallow to sit appearance

559
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:28,090
well she got out of jail early that was
the phase one story what we were

560
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:34,200
changing in iraq was on page 22 so make
people look over here the entertainment

561
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,240
industry is right for creating
distractions to its people will be

562
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,089
attracted and then follow their noses
tort oh look at the butterfly and ignore

563
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,290
what is it played site but if you can't
hide it at all

564
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:51,840
destroyed in plain sight like 2002
documented instances of UFOs

565
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,360
from around the world 250 countries over
50 years the degree of the small details

566
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:03,040
and I'll book includes a wonderful
lecture in 1954 from her over the father

567
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,570
of German rocketry based on more than 30
he said if I only had two or three said

568
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:11,080
I couldn't tell you about the ionization
of the atmosphere around the vehicle is

569
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,930
increased power changes the apparent
color because it's a nice day churches

570
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:19,839
around the vehicle as the intensity of
the power source whatever that force

571
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:27,010
field is increases this election 1954 he
said I had more than 30 reports 1954

572
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:31,900
borden 30 from USAir force and navy
planes using radar as well as multiple

573
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,730
sightings converging at the same spot
the readers said so what do you do with

574
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,880
that you ridicule people who say you say
they must be drunk or they thought it

575
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,100
was a balloon bababababa well 600 pages
have documented history shows you the

576
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,420
government took it seriously and
responded as effectively as they could

577
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,060
but the phenomena is this not go away
and therefore you have to ramp up the

578
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:59,980
ridicule until it reaches a point where
it is now inside it is a point where the

579
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,530
discussion is shall we confirm its not
disclosure because we have the data a

580
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:08,890
lot of the data anyway it shall we
confirm what people know because it's

581
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:12,299
not what people know that matters most
it's what they know that they know

582
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,580
everyone knows that's what I'm saying is
real but we don't know that we know it

583
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:23,210
it takes the authoritative voice to
imprint authenticity upon it and then we

584
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,340
say oh it's true

585
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:29,800
instead of well yeah kinda nebulous
anomalous these anomalies don't connect

586
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,010
to anything they don't change our lives
were born adjusted the price of bread

587
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:38,510
that we are in the fact that the
universe is teeming with life and we are

588
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:43,220
Johnny come lately stew the enterprise
of civilization a hundred years ago we

589
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:48,399
didn't have electric lights hundred
years ago we had gas lamps we had our

590
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,270
clamps now we have electric lights on a
hundred years later in the middle of the

591
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:56,780
20th century we thought the Milky Way
was the only universe there was we

592
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,040
thought that was the whole universe and
now we try to get her mind around the

593
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,600
meaning

594
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,920
of words like billions and billions of
galaxies each of which contains billions

595
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,890
and billions of stars each of which is
surrounded by billions and billions of

596
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:15,490
planets many of which like us have
spawned life because we know that one

597
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:21,600
knife can happen it will happen and the
discovery of life for some of us is

598
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:28,270
after the fact of the discovery of life
but the truth is all signs goes on this

599
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:32,500
premise if it happens once it's
interesting it happens twice it's

600
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,820
everywhere so if there's life anywhere
else in the universe and we know that

601
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:42,420
there is then there's life everywhere
and how does that change the context in

602
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,620
which we live

603
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,950
this is going to be the big event of the
twentieth century coming on

604
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:51,649
not that we know it but that we know
that we know and therefore will call

605
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,630
into question

606
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:56,370
societal structures promised on the
assumption that we're at the top of the

607
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:03,250
food chain and the apple of God's own I
will have to reconsider texture wise our

608
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:07,850
understanding of who we were and
redefine our identities and we will have

609
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:13,140
to rely on the resilience that has
gotten us through so many bad patches in

610
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:20,240
the past are you holding you should be
holding up a zero right minus five I did

611
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:26,029
alright so here's here's advice to you
when you're giving a speech make sure

612
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,420
that the person who holds up how many
minutes we've got left does not have a

613
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:34,910
minus five or minus 10 or minus anything
and therefore the communication can

614
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:41,649
never be delivered but you better shut
up so but she has delivered it in very

615
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:46,010
gracious style so I will shut up come
look at these two books if you want we

616
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,190
can get you want but I could also direct
you to how you get one of course cheaper

617
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:53,030

other day he'll just use torrent matter
