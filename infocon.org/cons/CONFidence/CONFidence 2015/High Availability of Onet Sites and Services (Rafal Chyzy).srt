1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,890
good afternoon everybody my name is
sorrowful whose chief security officer

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:15,660
powell met if you are Polish origin you
probably have heard about our about our

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:24,480
company because we are one of the major
electronic media company in parliament

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:34,059
consists of several companies and I have
to mention here another company which is

5
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:40,459
part of a group called the dream lap
because dream lapis our software house

6
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:47,530
so everywhere I mentioned something
about high-technology well you can be

7
00:00:47,530 --> 00:01:00,370
sure that it was developed by our
justice system company called you know

8
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:10,179
we as a company operating on her this
electronic media market what we do we

9
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:19,150
deliver sites and services to users
basically some of the sites free some of

10
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:28,210
these sites are paid and basically you
can say that online information it's our

11
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:35,079
business however you will you would look
at what we deliver we deliver

12
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,258
information we deliver information in a
form of electronic news in the internet

13
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:48,270
with deliver information from one user
to another user we deliver free

14
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:56,100
electronic mail service we deliver video
on demand and also where our income

15
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,979
comes from they are online knots as you
can imagine this free sites with news I

16
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,960
visited by many people in Poland and

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,130
and in the same time on this site so you
can see some adverts which we are paid

18
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:24,269
for information is everywhere it has a
different shape but it has to be

19
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:30,560
available it has to be integral and
confidential so we have to keep this

20
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,020
information secure

21
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:42,510
it's very obvious to say that it is not
obvious to keep our operation secure I

22
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:50,060
would give you several figures showing
the scale of the operation on that

23
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:58,100
provides supplies to the to the end
users about six billion page views

24
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:05,590
paging system month well our free
electronic email reese's incense 1,000

25
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:14,600
emails per second as on average we were
able to we were able to sell 500,000

26
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:22,810
para lo hd-quality video streams at the
same time and we serve more or less

27
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,630
five million age these streams per month
because users are generating some data

28
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,910
especially most of this data is stored
industry electronic email we also

29
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,780
process 3 petabytes of data our date
eyes let's say minority of this

30
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:46,260
three-part bytes of data being processed
in our datacenters our two data centers

31
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:56,929
located in case they have four point
five megawatt coal-fired power which

32
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:06,870
means we can in theory attached four
point five of our consuming service and

33
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,100
older devices and also take away this
amount of heat this infrastructure

34
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:20,120
producers

35
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:28,710
what is our challenge being public
services supplier is that we challenged

36
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:35,650
by cyberattacks we are challenged by the
doors attacks and we also challenged by

37
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:42,590
police regulations concerning like
personal data processing which I one of

38
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:52,880
the strictest in Europe I would say in
the world so many things you can do with

39
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:06,610
people's data how to secure our
operations and very sorrowful

40
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:17,580
dunno there's gonna be so dark it's the
top well so how we did this how we

41
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,770
manage to keep things running so we
decided that we had to we have to

42
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,560
classify in somehow

43
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:41,700
beaten PCs which are part of the whole
system but to be sure is more or less

44
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,669
important for us will give us more or
less money on more or less trouble we

45
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:53,570
apply it we shouldn't then applied this
three types of classification for the

46
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:59,780
sites or services what is the difference
for example our main sites have now is

47
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,448
called a site but in many cases it has a
link to a video content and and

48
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,570
streaming video is the service which is
also very important because video is

49
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:19,760
shared across the hall many many many
different sites we are providing for us

50
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:27,180
very important and is to be online which
means the advil

51
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,210
availability of the service is crucial
here where is block it says I would say

52
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:44,229
what why and he received so this figures
oldest this acronym stands for classes

53
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:52,570
so we say that the main page format
which is kind of the first choice of our

54
00:06:52,570 --> 00:07:02,380
User us it has class be a means balh and
Ry somebody I'm not pretty sure who told

55
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,780
us that why don't we switch our services

56
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:15,869
divide them and classify them like class
of the ROI Sao CA stands for British

57
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,169
Airways lost house US funds for La Jolla
Playhouse's and FYI for Ryan there so we

58
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,469
classified that something is very classy
medium classy and let's say budget

59
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:33,990
classy because Ryan there we will take
me to the court if I say something more

60
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:41,780
fences and because some sites or
services are processing date at which

61
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:48,760
are important like transactional data
private data or or user's personal data

62
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,289
which are protected by law in poland we
also issued a combination of integrity

63
00:07:54,289 --> 00:08:00,270
and confidentiality classes called ABC
red means the highest block should be

64
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:07,258
great is the lowest example electronic
mail free electronic mail that has a

65
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:14,710
several millions of users being active
and they keep process they own personal

66
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,870
information and also private information
so our free electronic mail is

67
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,470
classified for overall availability as
da and for confidentially

68
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:33,200
integrity and confidentiality as a as
well but on top of that we understood

69
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,919
one day that too

70
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,319
face issues with disaster recovery and
business continuity planning we have to

71
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:49,870
apply another class because some parts
of our sites and services are more money

72
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:56,350
and let's say money and equipment
infrastructure consuming so we could not

73
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:03,410
provide for example the highest business
continuity class for electronic or email

74
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:10,399
we can do it for the paid less say
division of our electronic mail not for

75
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,649
the free one so we also you should
discuss which are concerning business

76
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:24,990
continuity and five mins to resume full
business continued ET on certain Site or

77
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:32,380
or or service one means if it stops
because like server burns down or

78
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,980
somebody is just hacked to death

79
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:46,029
basically maybe it was the highest time
to end life of this site and having this

80
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:50,260
let's say I would say simple know how it
looks for you

81
00:09:50,260 --> 00:10:01,540
classification and looked we looked at
our the whole portfolio we started to

82
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:09,339
think what is the most important pot I
mean which part of our everyday business

83
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:16,339
processes are crucial for us so we check
them sorry for the black aural that I T

84
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:22,779
infrastructure if it's down if it's not
available if it's not basically in

85
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:30,430
operation it gives us the highest impact
to our sites and services and also the

86
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,269
highest possibility that it's gonna
happen cuz everybody knows that from

87
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:40,889
time to time the equipment just
basically fails the second part of the

88
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:45,699
whole system is people but looking our
cases

89
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:53,128
we we already faced before because we
had two small let's say business

90
00:10:53,129 --> 00:11:01,730
continuity issues in our history we
understood that people they give only I

91
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:09,079
mean not available or not president in
the crisis situation it gives only

92
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:15,569
medium probability to have severe issues
on the whole business and it's also

93
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:20,209
medium possible day it's gonna happen
that we gonna lose this people in some

94
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:28,079
boxes and they will not be able to work
for us at this very moment and the last

95
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:39,529
part we took into account was the supply
chain so how we are how we depend on on

96
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:47,939
the supply chain of goods sold excluding
power or diesel oil diesel fuel and

97
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:53,929
Internet connections we are we actually
do not need anything else if internet

98
00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:00,679
works if the power is they're all we
have to diesel fuel we can room

99
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:07,738
basically forever so it could be a
problem with if there is no power on all

100
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:15,899
fuel to the engines and planning how to
mitigate the highest risk we we we faced

101
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,249
which which was the problem

102
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:23,699
potential problem with the idea

103
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:32,889
infrastructure we decided to make this
infrastructure redundant we first of all

104
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:40,389
created divided sites and services
between two data centers it's obvious

105
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:45,259
it's a prime are they the center and a
secondary data center yellow and dark

106
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:47,880
blue rounded

107
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:56,890
around its class the size of a square
could tell the size of the data center

108
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:04,319
basically they are kind of to give you
the review how big they opt concerning

109
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,300
each other and also because we face many
problems inside our own technology which

110
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,709
was mainly developed by Jim let our
software house company we also decided

111
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:24,350
that some technologies concerning shroud
related technologies gonna be used

112
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:34,480
inside our our infrastructure so we
created so called on that private cloud

113
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:45,880
and slowly slowly but carefully we are
supporting our services our sides in a

114
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,500
group because we are also I forgot to
mention of the very beginning that we

115
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:57,820
are now part of a longer axis company
which owns us and we are working in a

116
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:05,500
group serving also different companies
related to Ringgold axis linger in this

117
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,870
electronic media world so coming back
quickly to own that private cloud we

118
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,440
carefully switching from the old
solutions to the new solutions based on

119
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:26,330
our clout we created our cloud services
to be able to be able to be around the

120
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:36,190
ball from Amazon Cloud because we even
for about the kind of disaster which

121
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:48,840
could take off both of our data centers
so we are one of the biggest if we are

122
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,360
fully operating from Amazon Cloud Amazon
Cloud users in Poland

123
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,470
I mean as a standby now there is only
one percent of our page views of uses

124
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,510
being served from Amazon Cloud and we
keep replicating data all the time in

125
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:12,670
case after disaster where the primary
and secondary side is not available all

126
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:19,719
some services from primary side is not
available we can switch the clout and

127
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:28,100
the end use it will not even know that
we are serving this from Amazon Cloud of

128
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:37,790
course from a muzzled crowd is pretty
expensive so we just keep the let's say

129
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:47,920
a new class of our top sites and then if
there is trouble with the primary data

130
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:56,370
center we tell clout to inflated self
and to intake and more and more traffic

131
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:11,959
from users and what we've done we that's
what I more or less us we not only 1 I'm

132
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:19,069
saying he is not only did theory which
was planned it is tested so we do a

133
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,899
small disaster recovery test daily we
save this one percent from Amazon Cloud

134
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,250
all the time

135
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:32,890
switching to different services they're
big business continued te tests are

136
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:39,380
performed every quarter and this is a
heavy tests we switching off the main

137
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:48,390
then they they dissent that and we watch
the the cloud as you know it's always

138
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:57,209
these details so from time to time we we
are discovering different issues for

139
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:03,160
example you know all the instances in
Amazon Cloud it's not easy recently too

140
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:10,579
to ask for as many as you want and a
muslim doesn't has a policy . we can

141
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:16,948
claim that we are a big player and we
can have as much as we want so for

142
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:22,150
example we had some problems with
instances available to grow we have some

143
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:28,940
problems with VPN channels for example
because the traffic was growing and so

144
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:35,610
on and so on so during the test when we
do really do this test every quota we

145
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:44,330
save our top I would say it's possible
that we do not save 75% of our took

146
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:51,460
sides from the Amazon Cloud the rest 30%
is I would say not important and even if

147
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:58,240
we lose it basically because I don't
know president putting drop for megaton

148
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,510
bomb boom crackle probably on that will
be served from Amazon Cloud but I don't

149
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,470
know whether there would be anybody
interesting in reading what's happening

150
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:21,200
in most people would like to know how to
run away from Kharkov probably why would

151
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:28,890
I mean all I said looks pretty simple
but as I said the details are all only

152
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:37,570
does this details are always making a
big trouble so i would tell you about

153
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:50,200
several things we use which in our
practice gave us gave us some well show

154
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,890
it it's shelled basically there without
a good management tools to to solve the

155
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,799
situation where your company is in
smaller or bigger crisis would be very

156
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:10,379
difficult issued on have several
supporting tools already tested and in

157
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,460
operation

158
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,690
first of all we had a piece of paper

159
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,970
it's not piece of paper is electronic
document called crisis management policy

160
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:27,340
which is approved by the Board and
announced to the people who are involved

161
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:34,049
in potential disaster recovery or or
business continuity crisis situation in

162
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:40,740
a along the company and its simple it
says who can lead

163
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,640
crisis management mode cuz we have
tumult it's a normal operation mold and

164
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,820
crisis management model so it's created
written there when to switch from one

165
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,370
mode

166
00:19:52,370 --> 00:20:00,199
Lada including how long the sites are
down and so on and so on and also it has

167
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:10,620
some passages which are saying that no
mob law the people leading managing the

168
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:18,159
crisis situation says the board can
always say there is no crisis management

169
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,260
situation anymore we switching back to
the normal operations

170
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:29,700
why is that been done to avoid
developing a case what if somebody who's

171
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,600
on the list

172
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,620
potential leaders of the crisis
management situation over takes power in

173
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:41,639
the company says it's a i mean this is
critical

174
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,000
ok so we running in a crisis mode and
you bored have nothing to to say I will

175
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,940
do whatever I want I will buy whatever I
want I will sell whatever I want and so

176
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,740
on and so on so we also stated that
there how to stop this insanity of

177
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,580
somebody being done of course they are
polish regulations which are saying that

178
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:13,030
only certain people which stated in in
cairo desk and cell company for example

179
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:19,129
but you can do any damage to the company
giving people won't this and people

180
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:27,179
think that somebody who is running the
crisis management mold is has a power of

181
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:33,420
attorney to do anything and they had
they know that they have to listen to

182
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:40,510
its oldest I would say so that's the one
to which is paper basically another toll

183
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:46,290
is something called soya which is system
hopes will be incidental vereen polish

184
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,990
its SMS based incident management
information

185
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:57,230
we noticed it's very important to spread
the information across the company and

186
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,150
depending on the severity of the issue
different groups of people alerted why

187
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:09,690
we use SMS channel SMS channel dies at
the end if there is no GSM enormous

188
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,390
amass it means there's probably no
internet and there is no communication

189
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,679
basically so if people people in our
company know that if there is no GSM

190
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,790
signal if there is no power there are
big issues going on in the city

191
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:34,020
dole swap parts of the crisis management
teams members or or manages they know

192
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:44,170
that they have to go to one of our let's
say backup lights but sites meaning

193
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,710
where people can see it can operate they
have a desk they have for power they

194
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:57,460
have internet connection from that so as
I said this channel SMS channel and this

195
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:04,190
communication tool allows us to manage
this the this smaller or bigger

196
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:12,080
disasters all the issues and as I said
because SMS channel dice the last that's

197
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,639
why we chose it and it's very
effectively operated for over 10 years

198
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:16,449
already

199
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:26,200
also what we've done we created
so-called business which is place which

200
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,700
is set on external infrastructure and
it's a corporate copy of cooperate male

201
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,190
kept some water outside our
infrastructure and our computers and

202
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,169
mobile devices they have two of these
may book boxes configurator for

203
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:49,740
everybody and now if our main site may
cooperate gmail is down because of some

204
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,879
issues in data center because in the
same data centers where the older parts

205
00:23:53,879 --> 00:24:00,639
of our businesses place also the
corporate mail mail is there after one

206
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:13,209
hour our mails our DNS appointed to this
PCP Exchange server and nobody has to

207
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,950
know that we have different email
address writing to me it will be

208
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:25,909
delivered to my backup mail and people
also can inside the company we can

209
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:33,769
communicate using using this BCP mail it
was tested it was created because we

210
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:38,799
faced this issue that cooperate males
doubtful accounts say for how long

211
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:49,779
ok and also I'm not there another tool
we we we we delivered to our selfs

212
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:54,100
because we understood that if there is a
problem

213
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,918
disaster of smaller or bigger the
telephone and voice call is not the best

214
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:06,759
issue because of all the phone so busy
France may not operate it happened

215
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:10,110
basically I will tell you in a second

216
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:16,270
so we used Skype to Skype is very tough
to kill we used Skype and a special

217
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:21,530
skype contact where you can communicate
during the managing the crisis situation

218
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,580
this channels

219
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:31,928
discharged groups are set a different
people contacting industry sets and then

220
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:36,770
at the end of the crisis when we write
the so-called post-mortem document to

221
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,610
say what happened how did it happen

222
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:46,428
who decided this enough we also paced
all discharge channel chopped into this

223
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:52,750
documentation to remember what was done
to build our own memory how to fix

224
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:59,520
similar issue in the future and also and
it's very very action this way of

225
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,520
communication is is very effective
especially when you have a problem with

226
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,780
like manages of higher rank all the
board if there is somebody brave enough

227
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:16,340
to teach your CEO to use job or
something like this I mean you have to

228
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,409
be brave to try to explain how to use
UNIX Windows to chat with somebody but

229
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:27,470
Skype is well known by everybody so even
our top rung managers they can quickly

230
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,620
chopped to certain rooms or to the
coordinator the one contacting now and

231
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,040
find out what's going on

232
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:40,860
we also keep a small site outside
external infrastructure where

233
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:46,909
information from this coordinated all
that and so your system just fed

234
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:54,770
basically and you can read the recent
kind of situation you have the recent

235
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:02,139
report was going on while we're managing
this issue and also there is all kinds

236
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,820
of documents including crisis management
policy holder telephone numbers all the

237
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,510
contacts all the names of the crisis
groups and so on so on so you can reach

238
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:19,230
true and contacts some manages let's say
managing databases basically if you want

239
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,460
you can find them and find out who is
the head of the

240
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:28,490
crisis management database five mins
basically and also we should eat their

241
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:34,490
information about our major sites and
these powerful moments how many page

242
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:41,170
uses is being served so this this graphs
which are displayed displayed there they

243
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:47,710
if if like our our whole system is down
you see what time the system went down

244
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,880
basically because your your grass will
stop they will not move because there is

245
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,870
not on your feet

246
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,959
basically so we know where there were
gaps with the system was down and so on

247
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,710
and so on we also information about like
network traffic and so on and so on

248
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:22,480
ok and let's say one of the last slides
I want to show it's just always dealing

249
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,720
with this kind of issues in any company
you have to think what I Detroit suites

250
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:38,220
which side you have to expect let's say
that under the attack it could be even

251
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,580
world it's pretty simple it could be
some people inside the company who are

252
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:52,070
saying it could be simple human Avila we
suffered many times for human from human

253
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:57,320
arrows we never suffered from inside the
press which is somebody doing something

254
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:05,689
really bad from the inside but trying to
mitigate this we tried to do segregation

255
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:12,100
of duties inside do not keep all the
eggs in one basket for example there is

256
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:21,049
a server which is so-called transit
service where you have to

257
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:29,908
SSH through inside let's say private on
its clout but you have to pass through

258
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:35,799
this an issue log in as root and getting
through this service down to the master

259
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:42,499
of puppets which is which is organizing
the cloud you have to explain why you

260
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:47,259
did this what was the purpose that you
did this for example such a simple thing

261
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:53,909
in transactional systems in financial
systems we also keep segregation of

262
00:29:53,909 --> 00:30:00,739
duties so we are trying to make not
possible for example to create employee

263
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:09,480
to set him a salary and two paid him and
this person do not exist so to stop in

264
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:19,440
such privileges to one hand and well
because we buy many things we sell the

265
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,830
advert is sold in the hole so you can
give some discount so we keep track who

266
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,119
is able to give give the biggest
discount ever for example and then

267
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:38,189
accept the invoice and everything
intruder sorry for my juicy speaking who

268
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:46,779
is able to you know change the discount
then accept the payment and hype this

269
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:53,389
inside our systems basically we don't
know that was fraught internal fraud and

270
00:30:53,389 --> 00:31:02,939
simple you just say some insider give me
the lower possible price and more

271
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:12,039
questions at the end I will kind of
tried to ask you has anyone told you

272
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:22,520
about the situation that you will never
go back home from this conference

273
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:32,950
way where you tested your home BC ppl
arms do you know and do you know how can

274
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:41,100
you tell that I'm not insane how can you
tell the Indus block block I do not

275
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:52,139
carry a kalashnikov right what if I have
kalashnikov is your family ready to lose

276
00:31:52,140 --> 00:32:00,150
you do they know what and how you pay
for your VoIP telephone because I face

277
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,590
this issue I mean not mean my family but
I face this is very important

278
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:12,929
this simple blunt the simple information
to be passed to your family to your

279
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:20,320
company to organize when you die in a
car crash when you died in a terrorist

280
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:30,470
attack so it's good to think about it
somehow

281
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:39,049
about my black buck

282
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:50,960
this is switched to a continuous fire
does it sound right so what now

283
00:32:50,960 --> 00:33:05,889
am i insane this is real it says here
that this armed doesn't work but what if

284
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:15,109
I'm insane that will be clever news
isn't it one day after the election this

285
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:26,299
news will probably kill the other news
so anyway we are part of being a taxer

286
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:36,359
Springer this is my email we operate
this site services and if anybody has

287
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:43,769
any questions I'm ready if somebody
wants to hold kalashnikov feel free

288
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:51,190
thank you so how often do you test your
disaster recovery plan and do you do it

289
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:58,639
fully or just on paper what kind of man
we we do it we do it every quarter and

290
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:02,269
it's real we do not test

291
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:08,909
like many companies used to test 'cause
it's pretty simple many companies just

292
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,829
tests like whether they come to reach
people over the telephone

293
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:18,369
whether they ready to switch off
something because the other part of the

294
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:24,450
backup infrastructure is ready we do it
pretty severe and there is somebody on

295
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:33,239
this audience called the NJ which is my
friend and my colleague and he's one of

296
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:41,799
the guys who is really doing it and this
is not like so-called bullshit we really

297
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:46,889
do it

298
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:54,819
switching primary data center to the
back of the datacenter you must have 22

299
00:34:54,819 --> 00:35:02,130
reporting to the management of this
well-designed towards and now we move to

300
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:10,960
the testing phase every quarter if I
understood you not really sure they

301
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:20,380
understood the question so what time to
spend 22 to develop full solution for

302
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:29,829
how long did it take to to to set up
everything nice was talking about right

303
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:40,860
ok so I would say took two years more or
less about the existing one percent of

304
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:47,870
network traffic request this is that the
one percent is one asset instead you

305
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:56,770
this day so why doesn't come out or it
is one of hundreds connection that you

306
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:06,610
served for services how we do it is here

307
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:22,180
ok to be honest I don't know but sorry
that he's not here probably well because

308
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:32,690
every let's say the crucial part of our
data and elements of infrastructure is

309
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:40,930
being replicated to Amazon we can serve
small amount of traffic to one of the

310
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:49,410
major sites but I'm sorry for that I
will ask in jail again for another

311
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:57,569
conference cause I'm not really sure
about that

312
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:07,400
re-writing and re-writing

313
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,440
services to one standard basically cuz
they were as you can imagine if you

314
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,549
operate on the market for 15 years you
have something pretty old and something

315
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:24,770
medium all then and something preteen
you and the biggest trouble is to turn

316
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:32,059
everything into into let's say moat
basically and especially because from

317
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:41,470
time to time we buy some ready-made
services it was also an issue because we

318
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:47,709
have to let's say will redo somebody's
else's service and fitted into our our

319
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:58,710
world basically how fast you're able to
enroll all the services AWS when

320
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:08,250
something bad happens well I would
target is about one hour because it's

321
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:17,670
impossible to to do it quicker but the
truth is that it takes up to two if

322
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:27,200
everything goes ok but if they are more
or less trouble going along and because

323
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,109
I understand that basically all the
traffic right now a certain percentage

324
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:38,000
like 110% is going directly to the WS so

325
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:46,900
availability like 99.8% because there
are services running all the time so

326
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,280
normally assuming redundancy of service
and someone should be able to get even

327
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,390
better

328
00:38:53,390 --> 00:39:02,330
availability well but this is the real
figure we show in and basically because

329
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:09,890
many this is the total of everything we
serve and because for example botched

330
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:18,029
awesome popular has several goals
intense I would say sometimes weekly

331
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:28,100
small changes which are bits and pieces
of just changed as a cult and is

332
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:36,420
deployed to the services from time to
time we have to withdraw the change and

333
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:43,880
it creates more or less trouble with Sen
service certain service is may be

334
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,240
feasible us online and available for
older uses but we know that he was not

335
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:57,740
it was only saved from cash basically so
that's why we for us this figure means

336
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:04,370
that we knew that the service was let's
say not editable as a front page for

337
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:12,620
some minutes or hours whereas the end
user will not even notice there is

338
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,819
anything wrong with it
