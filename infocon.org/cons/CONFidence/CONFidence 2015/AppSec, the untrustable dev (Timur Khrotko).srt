1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,340
welcome to my presentation welcome to
the track I cannot see most of your

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,629
faces

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:23,689
let me ask you whether so put your hand
if you are a developer rock and you're

4
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:44,800
not here and does with its security
audits ok because today criticized

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,510
lopez's but actually I would be same
critical to auditors but today the track

6
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,718
this track is about developers

7
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:05,600
entrust of all developers the type of
the states as well interesting in

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:16,139
organizers call these speeches lectures
so I tell you my lecture actually

9
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,299
sometimes I have to read out what I
prepared because half of my presentation

10
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:31,470
is brand new so I don't know by heart
what to tell so forgive me for days

11
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,970
my name is similar

12
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:45,000
I am the leader of the worst angry
chapter despite my being Russian

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,720
I started and finished my developer
career in the last century and the last

14
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:05,619
decade Iraq and I guess we and social
company we developed in normative access

15
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:08,330
management and that identity management

16
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:18,090
software for enterprises especially for
financial sector and now I do cyber

17
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:31,290
security consulting because it sounds
good too I also must finish my PhD in a

18
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:37,670
few years ago it was about dispositions
not I T at all these positions and

19
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:45,958
social construct and shot in short it
was about that we are all zombies and we

20
00:02:45,959 --> 00:03:01,000
are in even if we are always available
and we are executive managers I have to

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,500
introduce you all was the first present
or former track

22
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,870
always preserve us it's open the
application security project or more

23
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,450
exactly projects

24
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:28,820
dot org it's open source or open its not
for money except the donations made by

25
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:40,310
members and companies the most famous
project of always be stopped but please

26
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:49,650
remember it cannot be used in production
its educational thing and it is not a

27
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:57,630
standard so don't use it as a standard
venue to hold it if you do audits then

28
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:05,420
use a yes or yes the verification
standard as a proposed a standard that

29
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,220
can be used in production

30
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:17,829
and use developer guides well if you're
a developer and there are many to

31
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:25,970
assisting the real oprah's and auditors
just to mention to tap is a famous web

32
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:33,730
application with it too and one of new
tools with dependency dependency check

33
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:46,420
its name says what it does and the
supposed java.net entire time so this is

34
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,600
the type of my presentation I don't
trust about developer developer resume

35
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:00,770
the QR code points to the URL which
holds my presentation and it will appear

36
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:10,990
on the next flight also so my point is
and let's face it that general

37
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:18,270
developers will never care about
security

38
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,240
of course this picture does not
represent what I think about developers

39
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:37,390
but it tells a lot about the crowd you
may recall coders and I i would include

40
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:50,110
the quarters the quarters management to
this crowd and Calder is will produce

41
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:57,990
security only as a by-product according
to the gods practices or they got

42
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:15,470
practice practice so quarters will never
care about security and we have the law

43
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:21,600
we have lost the war for security
software because hackers warned because

44
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,700
after contains vulnerabilities and
arrays and this is the state of

45
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,390
production today

46
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:37,669
today I focus on developers and blame
the developer culture for

47
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,990
vulnerabilities but there are several
other rules closes like complexity

48
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:55,290
complicity yours also mismanagement or
methodologies lack of Roberts in order

49
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,020
to

50
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:04,460
on top of this criticism criticism I
would like to be constructive my main

51
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:11,289
concern is not the crowd are not the
quarters my main concern the way to

52
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:17,800
improve the more the more demanding
developers

53
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:28,159
and the solution I would for today is
secure coding well yes there will be no

54
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:39,370
surprises in my presentation a little
bit boring what i'm what i'm saying OK

55
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:45,190
application security concept application
security my point is that application

56
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,889
security is about quality assurance
quality assurance of the product and

57
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:58,569
quality assurance of the process the
production process and scenes software

58
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:06,330
is not a product but but the service
quality of the support process is also

59
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:13,479
as important and the other production
application security starts with threat

60
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:24,818
modeling or risk modeling this is an
important statement don't to audits

61
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:36,300
without risk modeling in enterprise
application security policy is that he's

62
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:44,020
the set of the main rules of game is
very important and social development

63
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,420
lifecycle Matata lodges

64
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:54,709
the other thing that are important in
enterprise and things

65
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:59,839
applications are happy anyway and cannot
be trusted

66
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,329
the counter measures like web
application firewalls loco dates and

67
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:13,829
stuff like that is very important here
is at this conference speaking about the

68
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:22,270
importance of audit and testing is
obvious the well let's be fair

69
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:30,900
oprah's does what they are paid for and
that is regional specification so

70
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,319
probably is a feat requirements
application security requirements into

71
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,680
the black box of development then we
will have application security as the

72
00:09:40,680 --> 00:10:02,709
old port is it a simple yes please
explain your point of view my

73
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,900
perspective application security is a
set of features some of these are

74
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,540
non-functional requirement summer
functional summer easy to test a

75
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,890
functional requirements relatively easy
to test some are very difficult to test

76
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,840
that's a non-functional requirement but
at the end of the day using a standard

77
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,290
like ASU vs the application security
verification standard you can give

78
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,569
developers about a hundred and fifty
requirements that would radically

79
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:37,220
improved application security thank you
Jim I do not agree with you fully

80
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,780
because developers have a different
skill set a mindset and in order to

81
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:53,329
think about threats you have to have
security mindset so developer black box

82
00:10:53,330 --> 00:11:03,160
black box or developers will not reduce
application security in this respect but

83
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:18,600
it's a good argument to go through the
ages for moving your attention so

84
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,839
quality is the problem

85
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:31,430
the production that we cannot trust in
terms of security quality developers to

86
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:39,319
produce vulnerabilities this is the
state of the industry and gym packed or

87
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:47,610
leftist background you cannot blame
homeless people for the situation

88
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:55,519
because that is a product of society so
we are all responsible for the state of

89
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:07,120
or industry today speaking of the crowd
home I represent by this flight made by

90
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:18,120
artist from beyond.com so speaking about
the crowd of quarters its they are

91
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,019
actually not lost and back to the gym
statement if you feed requirements then

92
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:32,529
they can produce application security I
would say that we can embed application

93
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:43,209
security into their mechanical practice
into their gods practice or let's name

94
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:48,670
it tatted practice which is in this case
means that developers do not

95
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:56,769
deliberately aimed to achieve security
but they use proper solutions

96
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:04,329
automatically and then application
securities created like when you use

97
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:09,099
angular sanitization is given in most
cases

98
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:16,399
let's say it's another way you can
program people to program properly but

99
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,319
really I'm not interested

100
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:22,310
today I might presentation today with
this

101
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:30,790
mediocre developers my question is how
should we support the more demanding I

102
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:36,240
would say professional part of
developers to it wants to be the

103
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,720
security quality and let's take a quick
look

104
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,440
regarding the root causes of the poor
state of the application security of

105
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,710
course first of all in my opinion its
complexity so softer today is too

106
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:03,420
complex it is a given behind the simple
interfaces we have spaghetti or quote we

107
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:12,079
have spaghetti of systems but but
complexity and spaghetti is not the same

108
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:21,500
rank the developers I who make
complexity in to keep complexity and

109
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:30,250
spaghetti state fees for tour is from
the scrum article of the English

110
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:41,930
Wikipedia and this nice guys are they
did a sprint meeting what is pictured

111
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:50,050
here and I i look at them as that part
of developers that I'm speaking about

112
00:14:50,050 --> 00:15:00,770
the develop professional people
complicity the decisions about the

113
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,980
production that defined the production
process

114
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:12,500
enterprise are made it tables with
several players and this decision making

115
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:23,120
or I would say the grieving process

116
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,850
defines the general equality of the soft
her and everyone is a conspirator in the

117
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:36,779
poor state of security today who has a
stake at this this game so for example

118
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:46,220
if if other fantasy royal auditor or you
think that your mission is to provide a

119
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,110
report you're not a world contribute to
the warmth of the security because of

120
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:59,170
all the tour today you must promote that
your findings are processed by the

121
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:05,040
lopers you must be part of it of course
the root causes mismanagement of

122
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:13,089
application security or insecurity
leaders does not respect the fourth of

123
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,910
design and testing

124
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:23,670
legal does not know how to set security
requirements and application security

125
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:33,770
managers have to be involved in the
development processes and also leaders

126
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:39,750
has to know when to include application
security specialists into the process of

127
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:49,209
development and this picture this tale
is from the x-men movie it's because I

128
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:58,270
was to show my point that major
breakthrough in application security I

129
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:11,059
would expect from a fantastic Roberts no
business logic of application so the

130
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:17,410
state of auditing the state of taste
testing today is immature and it has to

131
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:26,120
undergo once in order to improve the
application security also regarding

132
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,859
mythologies its

133
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:34,270
the problem is that will hold its other
business took a controversial approach

134
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:41,400
by selling dentists wherever possible
actually there were times when we had

135
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,730
trusted developers at seventy years and
at that time

136
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:52,420
programmers were educated people and
let's say select part of engineer

137
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,240
engineering culture and the software of
course that at that time was not that

138
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,120
complex but we could trust this paper
for the product in terms of security

139
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:10,689
quality there was such a thing like
trusted computer system now it sounds

140
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:19,700
like Skyfire actually there was a thing
for its called orange book already

141
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:28,690
booked it also sounds like think of
Harry Potter today you cannot expect

142
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:36,990
developers to achieve a desired level of
insurance because the probability of

143
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:44,700
parks are too high is too high so we
took me trust no one and despise so

144
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,630
there are different kinds of threats and
the problem is that threats come and go

145
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:58,260
but the probability of exploit the
Bulldogs remain because of lack of time

146
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:08,150
I wouldn't pay more attention on the
social contrasts construct nature of

147
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:13,990
security and that the notion of trust
can be approached by this postmodern

148
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:21,080
view of the established meaning of
things

149
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,179
13 about that

150
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:31,990
to trace threats is best business so
creating threats threats and

151
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:39,330
countermeasures the best business if you
follow Schneier then you know that

152
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:50,429
airport security established today is a
good example of eat so we trust notions

153
00:19:50,430 --> 00:20:03,910
we and entrust it is important to to to
trust construct a mental construct about

154
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:09,910
the world so do trust OpenVPN why do we
trust OpenVPN do you know who the people

155
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,600
are behind it

156
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:19,659
marketing people actually and you trust
Google you trust a poet and you trust

157
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:32,640
security grows so we trusted the open
source community we believe in the

158
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,890
quality assurance software open source
software open source softer and we

159
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:45,730
trusted defeat picture of OpenSSL and
matcha green could not break a hold on

160
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:53,170
this comfort but by stating that it's
written by monkeys who actually it's not

161
00:20:53,170 --> 00:21:00,999
what he said we hear it all the more
correct thing and later

162
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:09,929
ur actually at the enterprise the state
of application security is just the same

163
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:18,129
we have spaghetti of course we had such
we are everywhere and the tendency to

164
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:29,639
reproduce use application security so
why do we expect these guys these guys

165
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:36,918
are demanding professionals why do we
expect them to deliver proper security

166
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:44,919
they do their job professionally but do
they knew how to do for example

167
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:54,239
authorization properly probably it's not
their competence how how the past and

168
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:56,009
how to implement it

169
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:02,299
my question will be answered questions
would be why don't they take secure

170
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:13,059
coding coding trainings y donde 0.2% to
represent the security issue at their

171
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:20,099
scrum meetings I mean who is just to ask
whether the new feature the change the

172
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:26,589
decision may have security implications
just to synchronize the development

173
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:35,269
process the security why don't they call
a visiting securities especially to

174
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:40,799
persist participate in the critical
moment of the development lifecycle just

175
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:48,908
from time to time on schedule or on
demand that would be a detriment part

176
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:56,919
part of my presentation please take a
look at but because of the lack of time

177
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,220
I would stop

178
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:09,929
to speak about so proactive controls
probably would say some words of 83 s

179
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:26,179
the most important project in my view
yeah and another important part it it

180
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:42,820
makes you do risk modeling and makes you
think about the proper audit for that

181
00:23:42,820 --> 00:24:00,840
actual software or circumstances after
it is in so the rule or 440 2040 it is

182
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:11,418
about that the proportion of a force
devoted to design and testing correlate

183
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:16,909
with this software quality and
correlates with security quality so

184
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:24,400
ideal the major part of professional
force should be paid for design and

185
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,590
testing say forty 40 percent and only
20% should go to coding and other

186
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:40,230
activities and of course any abstract
job has to start with

187
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:45,810
threat modeling including design

188
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:57,740
and so i'm waiting for secure coding
courses Jim please express your support

189
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:04,270
from I'll say that security calling
course is the most important thing for

190
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:17,660
developers if you do wrong it can hurt
you more than help if you do it right

191
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,950
communicate in the developers language
talk about secure requirements I mean if

192
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:26,720
you produce as a security professional
you're gonna fail if you approach this

193
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,420
as a developer talking to developers you
have a chance of success even though I

194
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,490
do this for a living among the state's
most important thing it's one of many

195
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,300
important things to build a full
application security program is it fair

196
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,070
to call them

197
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:55,370
words especially that you have to be a
developer to talk to developers because

198
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,250
the most prominent problem today

199
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:07,650
of application security actually Jim
took a lot of my time so I

200
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:22,940
so one of you can leave him but yes what
you said is is one of the main concepts

201
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:29,040
and that developers talk to developers
because I think that one of the major

202
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:40,409
problems today is the attitude of the
auditors so your attitude as auditors is

203
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:48,860
one of the major problems to play today
whereas if you through secure coding

204
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:57,030
courses under developer and because this
attitude with this mines is with this

205
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:05,649
knowledge it would be one of the main
measures to improve their security

206
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,000
quality of the willapa city and
proficient prophetic

207
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,490
one of the important thing is that
professionals like learning

208
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:22,870
professionals does not like when your
reports says that developers were stupid

209
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:29,659
again but professionals like learning
and it is a bonus for professionals to

210
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:36,800
go to college courses and work workshops
the security cordon courses are not

211
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:48,550
boring especially if done by Jim and
security problems are fun to hear and

212
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:53,050
such topics as crypto are interesting

213
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:59,350
yeah

214
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:11,939
nah nah nah I think that we are
entertaining people so please take my

215
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,260
training I'd be an arrogant jerk in
Nowshera listen to meet as many people

216
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,710
who do training on saying is whoever
does it don't bring insecurity theory

217
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,940
bullshit talk about factual developer
techniques in the developers language

218
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,110
and you win you get into deep what I
call security theory bullshit you're not

219
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:37,370
waste their time and you're not
accomplish the goals you want so I tried

220
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:42,379
to bring security down to a list of
useful requirements when I can and

221
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,350
technical terms that developer centric
not Security Center that tends to be an

222
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,908
easier way to communicate this is just
normal human communication he want to

223
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:54,900
talk to someone the best thing you can
do is understand how they communicate

224
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,000
and talk to them in that way the same
thing works and training training is

225
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
just a specialized form of communication
in all seriousness team of its own

226
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,750
trying to say and of course I think it's
extremely important extremely important

227
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,559
but I would not be so arrogant to say
it's the most important thing that's

228
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:22,510
very debatable ok our experience and in
making secure coding courses is that

229
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:33,030
people especially especially in Eastern
Europe where developers some time are

230
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:41,139
has strong engineering background they
like the crypt a topic and they like

231
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,700
this

232
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:52,090
engineering stuff also in particular we
have good experience when to deliver

233
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,389
security secure coding training that are
adopted to the language into the

234
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:05,020
framework of that particular developers
themes or if you do it do it developer

235
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:12,529
security training or developer and
security experts trainings and that

236
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:22,480
actual language or framework java.net
OGS then the involvement of the

237
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:31,409
developers is much more positive and the
labs than hands on part if it prevails

238
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:41,570
it's also an important thing and I know
that team agrees with me that point I

239
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:48,510
would say imitation that in addition to
the secure coding training you can do in

240
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:58,980
order to practical thing the coaching
coaching sessions and our findings of

241
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,960
audit finance especially when the
experience of the training is fresh and

242
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:13,580
you other auditor can show your findings
and compare the course with the findings

243
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,740
made at the software of of death

244
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,299
developer team it works well so you can
face developers with real

245
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:29,870
vulnerabilities of their caught than
theory and reality connects it's also it

246
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:35,820
has to be the auditors in shitty
initiative to review the findings with

247
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:41,279
the local developers and again all the
tourists has to have a corporate

248
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:48,770
corporative attitude in this case and
auditors Security Auditor is most of the

249
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,779
times

250
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:58,340
lack this cooperative attitude speaking
about developer coaching it is that

251
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,840
specialist audit or or or

252
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,870
can sit together with the developer and
reviews code hands on and it's more

253
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:23,279
involving them prepared lab exercise so
reviewing the findings the training and

254
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:32,590
coaching works better together it's well
you can use the various energy for it so

255
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:40,959
security training on itself does not
work very well unless it is connected to

256
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:54,970
the reality of that concrete developer
team and other thing it's it's it's an

257
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:03,169
advertisement of over my speech that
there is there are card games to keep

258
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:08,710
security awareness among developers and
I would mention that there is a

259
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:16,289
Microsoft thing elevation of privilege
your pee and now there isn't always a

260
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:20,970
card game it's called cornucopia please
use it

261
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:27,980
developers so do your homework these
incidents response because you will be

262
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:36,610
hacked sooner or later an important
question I wouldn't keep it where are

263
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:43,129
the resources I think that resources are
in the corporate ethical hacking budgets

264
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:53,020
these companies and too much for pen
testing and all the old its which ends

265
00:33:53,020 --> 00:34:01,440
up claiming that how bad applications
developer says stupid but so it's badly

266
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,200
spent money instead relocate money from
audits to trainings and all the

267
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,010
proactive stuff I have focused on
developers today but actually I also

268
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:22,480
criticized ethical hacking and auditors
other second part of important people to

269
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,580
to blame

270
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:29,179
what about small and medium businesses
small medium businesses complain that

271
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:33,610
they cannot afford for application
secure application security competence

272
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:41,700
myself saying is that it's not true you
can always rent security specialist at

273
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:48,418
the critical moments of development
process for example a design and setting

274
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:56,219
up your testing environment plz call a
visiting Cecil delegate him decisions

275
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:04,100
use Microsoft as the army total lodges
appoint security champions in teams and

276
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:11,319
take courses what you can say small and
medium businesses developing software

277
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:21,900
well my last last last slide that so
when one developers are synchronized

278
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:28,260
visit the processing of the security
issues so when developers are

279
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,970
synchronized reproduce processing of
security issues security my becomes

280
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:44,859
absorbed into the production and sees
his two previous being hated hated

281
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:56,240
requirement so let's focus on these few
developer brigades who are disposed to

282
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,229
improve that's my message thank you very
much

283
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:07,710
if you have questions then please

284
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:12,330
no thank you very much for your
attention pleasure my pleasure to talk

285
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:19,950
to you and thank the team ok so I'm a
developer

286
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:31,330
question yeah ok question I am a
developer and I came here first time to

287
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:38,109
see how I can improve my knowledge of
security to see how can my abs can be a

288
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:45,480
tax a tax for example and I wanted to
address one think you so examples crime

289
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:55,500
and from my experience people working in
Scrum methodology are expected to

290
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:04,460
deliver they work fast without much
insight into security because that's

291
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,830
what the project manager expects us to
do to deliver functionality and the rest

292
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:18,060
will come maybe later and from my
personal perspective because I'm doing

293
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:27,920
my personal project with which I wanted
to be safe and secure from my

294
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,730
perspective for me it's very hard to
trust tools to open source tools because

295
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:44,609
I i dont have an available documentation
and even some payments provider provides

296
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:50,140
good documentation telling me which can
which things can go wrong so I have

297
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:57,950
really big uncertainty I try my best to
limit the possibilities but I have you

298
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:08,589
well I didn't get what actually was your
question but

299
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:15,220
know it was important about what he told
that actually it is one of the biggest

300
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:22,310
problems that business and that's what I
wanted to to say among the root causes

301
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:27,640
of the poor state of application
security ray its management and because

302
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:37,990
management management or clients clients
who are paying for applications and

303
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:43,450
because the functionality and the
deadline

304
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:49,370
these are the two things that are paid
for and not only paid for but the legal

305
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:55,359
part of the contracts so if you have a
contract with your client for for

306
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:02,350
supplying a softer then you have
probably no requirements regarding

307
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:12,160
security I don't know what's what is
your case but that was rather my inside

308
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:19,020
not not question so I just wanted to
defend programmers because I don't know

309
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:32,009
how many of you here are programmers and
I i think from from my perspective that

310
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,530
my friends moralist know how to do

311
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:43,480
secure the relation but they don't know
how to secure a very complex systems

312
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,230
which are distributed throughout the
world that does does the problem in my

313
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:58,950
opinion ok but then shortly I think that
my message was called specialist so when

314
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:08,620
it comes to security questions that are
beyond your competence and it's not your

315
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:18,200
problem because it's not your specialty
then and involvement of a security

316
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,399
specialist has to be included in the
into that project from the beginning in

317
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:33,340
my opinion so it wouldn't be expected
that developers no security if you say

318
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,730
that your friends know how to do

319
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:43,450
optimization properly it can be true in
most cases but probably in several

320
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:48,200
important cases they will like some
knowledge how to implement in that case

321
00:40:48,200 --> 00:41:02,140
so my advice would be still to pay and
security specialist to participate in

322
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:13,859
the design phase and or 2222 audit but
20 did not in past time at the ready

323
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:26,520
softer but to audit the design of your
application before it get developed have

324
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,310
to finish now so thank you very much
again thank you
