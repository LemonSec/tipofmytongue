1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,140
cool

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,480
marion krecko its competence conference
and make this is getting cold winter

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,990
Logan

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,490
hey up could you please tell everybody
what do except exactly a

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,220
so at confidence I'm an organizer of a
cup to deflect competition this year

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,380
same as last year however miss them to
combat the system based

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,390
it's about my main bank here apart from
battered by dinner

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,369
but I do normally I work a what the
company

9
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,640
I'm and whenever security teams for

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,270
aunt I guess our service and security
research and if you were to describe the

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,700
people have no idea what capture the
flag is how would you describe it

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,870
what with that okay so capture the flag
is actually a

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,849
packing competition discuss practical
awesome deaths and usually you get

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,920
a couple of tests from five to thirty

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,120
sometimes 50 its task is basically

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,410
well as separate challenge but you have
to

17
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,800
analyzed understand and so usually this
involves quite a lot of acting skills

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,060
and various categories in various areas
of security

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,640
ranging from web security for
cryptography is the demographically

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,220
up to low-level exploitation reverse
engineering

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,709
I guess forensics is sometimes assembled
so

22
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,140
because that's how it works it starts to
sexually has scored

23
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,270
so even a difficulty berries in the past
sometimes were

24
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,819
tasks are arm pretty easy sometimes
their heart

25
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:35,220
and depending on the hardness level
about Oscar resistant to salt by R-rated

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,670
parents from 130 very busy passed
through

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,080
534 hair complex tasks and

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,220
the well a CDF is normally they
monitored and I'm confident we play from

29
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,259
yesterday from

30
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:51,170
noon to all pendant almost all the time
for us to make a break

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,400
grover teams are allowed to play a slow
are

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,490
does not think europe and %um it's there

33
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,320
stocks today at 3pm and team which

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,750
gets the most brings grams and how's it
going but now how do you rate level of

35
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,970
participants this year

36
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,130
survey data sir really high outside

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,350
as expected actually because couple well

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,640
quite a lot of great teams but come to
our competition

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,790
and bass old some incredibly hard to
pass to tight personally believe no one

40
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,239
will so during the city of the great

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,890
there by surprise me really positive
year especially about me did so very

42
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,488
most them yesterday some again today so
I would say they love is really great

43
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,180
with the price for leading the
competition so this year for a

44
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,610
first-place civilian targets that 10,000
police not to use

45
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,220
a second blaze gets arm 5,000 and the
proposed it still doesn't notice

46
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,660
they looked at the bar from their
capture the flag competition also

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,060
organize the separate track

48
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,390
the decade it till CTF a how many teams
appeared and what were the speaking

49
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,869
about

50
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,050
yes sir ami actually it was kinda
related

51
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,350
because we decided to experiment a
little and gift buying small making a

52
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,540
talk about CGS

53
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,730
and and beyond five teams decided to

54
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:12,880
better but aren't and we did a alright
mean dark but lasted from 10 to 20

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,440
minutes

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,900
be does not certain I

57
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,100
I guess some people came and there
wasn't a huge crowd to a mariner some

58
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,290
people are really interested but for
some reason couldn't bury and bear

59
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,000
because they're happy to actually be
able to hear something about the CDS

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,200
after all again for us so can expect to
PF at the next confidence

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,700
yes as I think so from I think this year

62
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,369
we had quite a lot of them more people
out and even we expected more people

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,030
playing the city of and I hope to make
it even a bigger city of next year maybe

64
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,820
more time we

65
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,260
be able to go maybe we'll increases be
victim limit

66
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,989
from foreign for people to fight people
yeah I really hope there will be a city

67
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,020
of next year

68
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,250
and I hope it will be a great time let's
hope so thank you let

69
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:06,080
thank you Khan

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,110
on
