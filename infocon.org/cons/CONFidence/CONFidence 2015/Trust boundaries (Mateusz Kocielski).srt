1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
hello thanks for having me we are going
to spend on Fox 45 minutes talking about

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:13,440
trust was his trusted software and what
are the dangers of security in regarding

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:22,720
222 such software sought information
about me and maybe because I've got some

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,580
cultural the slides and there are still
some seats front row so maybe when I get

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,920
a little bit closer I wanted by two I
promise ok so I am apprentice to open

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,879
source commuter from time to time I I
found some security issues you're

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,250
probably probably know the php project
I'm not going to ask you if you use that

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:58,739
India's deal because your answer will
probably miss me so what is this all

9
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:59,468
about

10
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:07,380
I've got some background all Sasa
software developer I was for a key first

11
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,250
set several years so she called the
white in color or even house Co called

12
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:20,970
her and I was always wondering if the
coat which I rode some particular day

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,860
really works

14
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:32,619
you know it drives me insane so that's
probably I worked in security industry

15
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:40,650
knowledge of this talk is to see how
many assumptions are didn't believe that

16
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,869
some code is secure

17
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:53,110
I want also to show you show review some
of my findings you will see some proof

18
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,570
previously unreleased parks

19
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:09,269
open a society for example so it's gonna
be fun so so what is trust is always

20
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:17,950
good to define what we are talking about
I was digging in dictionaries but that

21
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:27,549
was pretty use less work in fact because
dictionaries are not referring to any

22
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:36,020
way to software and moreover if you were
if you'll try to find what is trust

23
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,800
you'll find links to another world which
other words which leads to another world

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,650
and then you get to trust again so if
your computer fixed on you will get

25
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:59,370
pretty used us pretty useless to finish
so instead of week doctor

26
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,769
dictionary definitions I decided to put
the image on the slide because some

27
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:13,420
people believe that it's worth more than
a thousand words and I agree and well

28
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:20,559
what do you think we are the hand that
feeds or the birds you regarding to the

29
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:31,430
software security ok I can tell you that
in fact we are the bird but you know if

30
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:42,010
I pull a rabbit out of the hat I can
talk here but I from mister some boxing

31
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:53,019
open a sales show must go on and if I
say that some trust that some software

32
00:03:53,019 --> 00:04:02,320
is trusted for me I really mean that it
satisfy two properties first one is that

33
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:10,340
it doesn't hurt me for example I expect
that might be the yes you are it's not

34
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:19,230
we will not give you all my files upon
open document

35
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:25,960
program and the second one that software
does what I think so I would be

36
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,830
surprised if my favorite video viewer
send data to some kind of cloud or

37
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:40,359
something like this and what this
trusted software it actually relies

38
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:49,310
heavily on the requirements and many
other variables so you can have each of

39
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:55,340
you have your own definition but since
we are under security conference I guess

40
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:05,710
that we can assume that all paranoid and
this is probably the most interesting

41
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,960
slide presentation because I expect some
discussion

42
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:20,120
my question is do you use for example
dimick's after liver

43
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:30,680
me too only men who use line of sorts
after rising

44
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:41,110
trusted ok not the reaction I i trusted
but not as much as for example OpenBSD

45
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,010
so what about Windows

46
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:55,150
if you're not using probably all of you
use Windows software is that true

47
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:06,388
yes some of you use Windows software do
you trust it I see also come second song

48
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:15,820
reaction so well regarding the OpenBSD I
must admit that this is the first one

49
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,010
when I resent those flights are you gave
a talk two years ago at security besides

50
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:29,570
and collected some some let's say

51
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:40,590
comments from dark dark and people were
very confident that open views the is

52
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:50,340
secure software because they implement
so many security mechanisms they agree

53
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,030
ok

54
00:06:52,030 --> 00:07:01,409
ok and what about the clout to your
Gmail Dropbox I'm sure you are using it

55
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:13,150
and the stock is not about her clothes
off to war whatever it is this is

56
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:21,390
actually very true picture it's not
funny I'm just 44 all of you that keeps

57
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:27,570
data in the cloud and remember that
there is no clout there's just other

58
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:38,320
people's computers so let's focus on the
real source software and from my

59
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:48,860
interview many people I have following
observations so people rather trust

60
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,870
small software for example exile is not
a good example because if you want to

61
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,950
ask for example two numbers it would be
probably better to use something smaller

62
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:07,800
and what is funny people trust maybe not
funny because this is based on our

63
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:17,680
intuition people rather trust open sores
and lemurs who created

64
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:25,320
Phoenix project stated his own law which
is also follows given a North Naples all

65
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:37,830
bugs aren't so how many of you ever read
any open source called so I would say

66
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:46,950
that is less than 50% of people in this
room so we rely that some group of

67
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,100
programmers developers security
professionals or whatever

68
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,860
read the cult and it is secure of course
in regarding Tampa source become very

69
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,339
sorry for yourself but you know it's
it's not possible when you get for

70
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:14,149
example from fruit FreeBSD like 15
million lines of code you can even

71
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:23,670
scrolled up you know some say the same
time and I'm pretty sure that if you're

72
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:34,479
really use any kind of UNIX or Linux you
use binary packages have you ever

73
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,510
verified for example if they were
compiled from the cult which is

74
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:48,290
available on the Internet at probably
not and will not know it is possible

75
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,620
because some projects like to be under
FreeBSD

76
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,970
working on the bills that can be
reproduced in your kitchen so you can

77
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:07,920
very find yourself that the binary
status actually compiled from from

78
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:17,860
source code which is publicly publicly
available and of course we rather trust

79
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,860
south to refer good reputation

80
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:35,500
well probably around no longer is is
well today put here another system to

81
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:42,370
Windows because now it has met many
security features and I think it's

82
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:49,350
pretty secure right now but I don't want
to talk about you know some general

83
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,760
ideas I want to take particular software
expose it to the internet and see what

84
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:05,800
would happen so I want for example to
factor that software into prime factors

85
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:12,050
and see if they are secure so what would
you think which software you can choose

86
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:20,899
in order to do so such experiment you
can pick any software I created like

87
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:30,360
20,000 versions of this box open society
what a great choice

88
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,769
so by acclamation we are choosing
openness age why because it's relatively

89
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:43,920
small it has been designed its well
written or so well I usually enjoy

90
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:52,089
reading code but open societies pretty
good culturally if you for example want

91
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:57,029
to see how to implement security
mechanisms take a look at the Open

92
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:06,000
Society and well does not not only my
opinion but also you probably know him

93
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,589
things the same and it's actually very
popular software I'm sure that all of

94
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:23,630
you ever used open society directly or
indirectly actually made some scans few

95
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,080
years ago and the hit rate was

96
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:39,960
pretty good and who has seen the matrix
movie can you recognize this scene yes

97
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:49,360
so to be honest I haven't seen the movie
but friends told me that but friends

98
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:59,300
told me that there was a girl she's name
was a treat she was breaking into some

99
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,349
plans or something like this and
actually she used a barking open society

100
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:11,960
so can we trust openness age well it was
more than a decade ago so let's see how

101
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:20,630
things looks like today by the way I
guess that this book was found by very

102
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:30,230
known American researcher so transponder
its huge are hard to trust boundaries

103
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:38,310
and serious are some grave doubts I
factor the computing environment

104
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:45,270
enterprise elements and you rehearse
some boundaries between the elements so

105
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:57,270
modern world we have a binary which is
linked in dynamic or static way to some

106
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,360
libraries them now

107
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:12,240
CPU other hardware physics and what is
behind that so captain obvious to the

108
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:20,780
rescue some pretty simple observations
if we are running for example our South

109
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:29,089
Korea on untrusted hardware than
software is no longer trusted and even

110
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:37,790
simple software has a rather complex
form the basis for example if you put

111
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:48,870
your hello world program you see pretty
similar grass because for example hello

112
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,910
world needs now and that usually more
than 30 million lines of cars you've got

113
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:03,459
some drivers for this play etc etc so
even the simplest software is not simple

114
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:16,960
anymore and our goal for now is to see
if each of these graphics secure so this

115
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:25,520
is your first results for four years ago
I was the cult which is responsible for

116
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:35,730
added some functions to

117
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:44,870
handle certificates and they made some
city silly mistake because no societies

118
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:53,329
pretty defined protocol there are some
documents are overseas pharmacies or

119
00:15:53,329 --> 00:16:00,300
something like that how a society should
look like

120
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:10,170
also documents which specify how
certificates should look like and

121
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:17,639
series the culture that fosters
certificate it does doesn't matter what

122
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:28,750
is it exactly but open a society to
reduce which certificate which is signed

123
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,720
by certificate which is somebody
certificate which is signed by

124
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,290
certificates of some kind of Montreal
and you will get those two functions

125
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:50,029
calling themselves recursively and I've
got pretty big stock friends so as a

126
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,750
result you can get

127
00:16:52,750 --> 00:17:02,769
overflow but fortunately those
certificates are kept in something which

128
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:09,720
is called chunks pocket tanks and
limited but some cookies this time but

129
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,530
probably direct some exotic

130
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,099
architecture we're talking pretty

131
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:25,480
found it something important is used to
be so for now it's not exploitable it

132
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,610
was takes time many years ago an open
society but it shows that not

133
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:38,149
necessarily open society is parked free
another example is actually the real

134
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:48,169
barking an open society this is pretty
fun bike because open societies

135
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:54,820
developers made some mistakes we've gone
through two tickets they used a field

136
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:01,980
called neurons some you know very smart
people who knows

137
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:08,080
told them that that nonce fields should
be replaced

138
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:19,120
ostracize remember they suggested this
field at the very beginning of the of

139
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,090
the certificate and they've got

140
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:30,709
implemented but made stupid mistake that
when you were issuing

141
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:39,480
all type of certificate denounced was
not was not initialized and the problems

142
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,669
serious that you will get in public

143
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:51,320
certificates a part of your stock memory
which in fact can for example contain

144
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,110
some data from your private keys for
example so it was also

145
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:05,559
many years ago but now it's still
possible for example to perform timing

146
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:11,730
attacks against open a society there are
several tools in the Internet to do so

147
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,260
so I guess that open a society is
pronounced secure but we can see that

148
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:26,520
some something happen and it might be
unsecured so what about the libraries

149
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,370
because open a society does not
implement home Lipsy and start so let's

150
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:41,889
see a by the way we have only for
library something slide because those

151
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,830
foreign libraries are used at direct
indirect played by open society but

152
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:52,928
actually if you see on the ballot for
example there are nearly like 15

153
00:19:52,929 --> 00:20:01,720
libraries use indirectly by open society
so if you are an open society not open

154
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,090
this is the last time you will need a
leap OpenSSH compacts liar which

155
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,999
implements the functions which are not

156
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:17,289
part of let's see that your system use
because open views the developers are

157
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:26,329
the several functions that help them
write code is insecure a so they decided

158
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:33,829
to write some kind of blue which
implements those functions for other

159
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:44,479
platforms and this part of called
heavily relies on openness also lets you

160
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:50,539
open societies broken if open societies
block under this law library will be

161
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:59,679
broken too so I guess that all of you
ever heard about openness to sell some

162
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,600
people have pretty bad

163
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,540
opinion about this cult actually many
developers Trump is the world thinks

164
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:19,840
that this protease pretty bad but
actually the use it and all of Britain

165
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,340
found that we think both that this is a
secure and we are

166
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:36,490
using many many projects rely on OpenSSL
I have investigated FreeBSD ports and it

167
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:47,240
looks that indirect way more than 700
for its use it you know six others are

168
00:21:47,240 --> 00:22:01,920
no contingency is in general very heart
thing and you can you can't write

169
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:11,090
could seek out and know everything about
cryptography and there are some rumors

170
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:17,629
that actually people behind openness and
Sarah learned see by writing this

171
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,560
library

172
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:29,980
well it might be true if we will see
what is inside because many many funny

173
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:38,760
comments in the code for example I don't
know why it is that way or don't think

174
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:46,490
this is used just designed both all the
digits for now because it sucks so you

175
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:53,640
know it's pretty bad that our security
relies on this library if you are more

176
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,490
if you want more golden quote openness
to sell them subscribe open a

177
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:11,330
self-starter Twitter so after famous
helped attack OpenBSD guys decided to

178
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:18,830
for the library and to remove from the
call from the OpenSSL all things that

179
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,399
are not used for example in the OpenBSD

180
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:33,279
so in general people things that this
library is more secure than open a

181
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:43,950
society so let's take a solvency secure
that's funny thing that I kind of like a

182
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,720
cell is actually heard leet

183
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:59,890
logo so you know that Coach is quite so
I decided to take a look at the small

184
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:06,390
sub library which implements numbers
which should be pretty easy and don't

185
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,030
get me wrong I don't want to learn
openness to solve developers for

186
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:17,879
anything because I think that it's all
it's called all of us that we let our

187
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,440
security

188
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:38,090
into the hand so it really easy to
implement that cult without parts but

189
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:51,209
actually library a cell use three
representations of 0-0 and 0000 the last

190
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,850
one is the last one is actually not

191
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:03,620
legal but if you are using library a
societal we've all that back routines

192
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:14,520
it's perfectly legal because the problem
is that sometimes those zeros not so

193
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:28,120
let's see if inconsistency can't hurt us
so she is the first off by one we can

194
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,860
get somehow minus zero and applied to
the function which translates the big

195
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:43,668
number into the representation of the
number and if you if we will take a look

196
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:52,920
at this cult 4-0 it will allocate to buy
its here as a top

197
00:25:52,920 --> 00:26:04,080
0 but in fact we write to the streak P
three bites while bye bye to return here

198
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,679
one here and one here so we will get a
classical of by one but which probably

199
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:19,370
can't hurt us you know that's much as
hell bit but obviously it shows that

200
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:26,739
something wrong with this library and
there is another example you can pass

201
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,360
your own

202
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,320
value to run function which gives you
random bits

203
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:49,090
from library it doesn't matter so if you
can control this this argument can put

204
00:26:49,090 --> 00:27:00,470
here a while so let's take a look if you
put into the beach then you get here by

205
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:06,680
equal one so we would allocate one

206
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:16,910
bytes of memory but here we are writing
to you by texting to bite so and other

207
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:27,290
of buy one example so I guess that goes
to show that my brother is not

208
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,580
necessarily secure

209
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:39,439
regarding 20 want to keep that parses
this park is pretty complicated and to

210
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,050
be honest I paste it here

211
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:59,760
updated cult so don't know but actually
but many well this page you will find

212
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,020
frequently asked questions

213
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:08,580
developer things that these parties
actually an optimization but they fix

214
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:18,600
that so regarding to Lipsy there is a
fun story behind that because we found a

215
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,459
buck during last year's

216
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:32,130
qualifications we downloaded the binary
and running it on our server and

217
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,040
actually it was kind of shower and we're
running several commands with Polish bad

218
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,090
words which some of them contains some

219
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:52,580
characters which are handled by lapd end
and we get with triggers doubles three

220
00:28:52,580 --> 00:29:00,820
get address info and we thought that it
is a part of the task but actually it

221
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,540
wasn't

222
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:13,820
but the park in the deep sea was real so
let's see if security so if you take a

223
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,470
look at the current $1 million lines of
code that that running to the next to

224
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,600
each other on same privilege

225
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:31,459
there are you know everything that for
protocol assistance and many more

226
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:37,400
and this example of the barking the
previously called it actually fix it so

227
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:46,300
it's not pretty important through
analyzed now but let's see do not use

228
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:56,370
the example this value is 100%

229
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:04,050
taken from the you user land so user can
allocate costs money buys us here on and

230
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,990
in fact you can take all the

231
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:14,679
memory in the system and make system
panic and despite its not exploiting go

232
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:26,070
in on x86 architecture and AMD 64 about
the fact it's explained tables part 64

233
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:36,830
after the presentation I can tell you
why this is another example this is

234
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:43,409
marking the library which is used to
exchange data between the user lantern

235
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:57,890
journalism structured way police or
something like that by our standards

236
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:15,940
serious look that come on my page and
make the current now so let's go deeper

237
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:24,470
there are obviously box appears there
was talk many years ago in the box

238
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:34,280
done by Chris Kaspersky but actually not
many details were there but obviously if

239
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:43,330
you remembered interview process source
you probably remember box those

240
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:59,750
processors also if you would for example
take evaluation boards of for example di

241
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:12,360
product you will find that there are in
fact many parts hardware and I guess

242
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:20,029
that none are you ever wondered was
inside the room and

243
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:27,190
have you ever for example where were
your superiors factories by for example

244
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:36,090
unless I remember or recall the rumors
around around

245
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,879
opt out which was

246
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:47,340
forbidden in the crib is the so for the
moment we will talk about philosophy

247
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:55,600
well you know if you will think how
physics word

248
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:04,389
work and if it's consistent in whole
universe for example if you type if you

249
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:09,679
pass the question to your favorite
search engine you will find many runs

250
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:24,160
about it we don't know how physics work
works million light-years from what we

251
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,460
expect that is constant and probably
open as a society will not suffer

252
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:37,000
because of that but if you are if you
are if you want your cock outside the

253
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,220
solar system probably it's not funny
anymore so we don't know still was

254
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:52,750
behind the physics but there is one
quote actually by customers which I

255
00:33:52,750 --> 00:34:01,640
really like and it is that in God We
Trust everything else we trust and there

256
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:07,110
are some doctors actually we haven't
talked about the Protocols of your cedar

257
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:14,239
box them to formally prove that there
are no box in a cell for example model

258
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,379
awesome

259
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:25,839
models it's not 100% free and remember
that the absence of proof islam is not

260
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:35,299
the proof of absence also in the regard
to alter its we can use multi tools to

261
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:43,279
in order to verify all your it but
actually there is long crowd from the

262
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:51,539
very fight are going to vary fight card
because we have to pick up some language

263
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:58,150
reform formal semantics Cody trusted
verified it and then we should recall

264
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,580
that

265
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:08,020
we need to compile that is verified and
since open societies

266
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,830
written in C we need to be verified

267
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:21,620
compiler in order to fat our machine and
obviously there are many bugs in

268
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,009
compilers there was found

269
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,040
research done by some American

270
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:37,440
some American scientists and they found
more than 300 bucks popular compilers

271
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:50,270
there is a protocol concert which which
go mister

272
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:56,330
make verified compiler and it means that
the code that we get from this compiler

273
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:03,490
is 100 100% consistent with the
semantics of Si Si

274
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:10,810
standards not ninety but actually there
was a barking dog coat and if you take a

275
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:18,580
look at the translation processes it's
insanely complex so I'm pretty sure that

276
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:28,610
there are more bucks so what are the
conclusions so of course its own way but

277
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:40,890
to be paranoid sorry read the card or
not be surprised it's actually good for

278
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:47,379
us interrogators that will never get rid
of bugs in software but to be honest all

279
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,210
those years

280
00:36:50,210 --> 00:37:00,080
works usually fine you know I ran some
instance of open society a party and

281
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:09,910
other servers and you usually I sleep
well so I would like to also say thanks

282
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,060
through

283
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:17,270
moderate chronic and keep our Liang who
helped me a lot with this presentation

284
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:27,690
some bucks presented here were found in
cooperation with them so thanks them if

285
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:36,050
you would be interested in some other
concepts of distrust you can take a look

286
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:58,530
at those links after the conference and
this is time for questions

287
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:04,360
where we were when you mentioned OpenBSD
before the end of the flight deck you

288
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,080
you you you shoulda statement from open
cessation better paranoid done sorry

289
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,610
what's your opinion about obesity I mean
they're actually trying to be right

290
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:19,970
very paranoid incremental this you know
the ones that will make exploitation

291
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:24,220
difficult very difficult even if you
find a bug so what's your opinion on

292
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,609
that

293
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:30,100
well I think that you know it's it's
hard to compare OpenBSD to any other

294
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:44,750
project because they're kind of group
that is pretty close actually if you

295
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,760
would like to talk to them about
security they probably would tell you

296
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:57,260
that your company's CEO because security
should work like this or some other way

297
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:03,830
and my opinion about OpenBSD day has
many security features and user space

298
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:10,330
but actually done lock mechanism to
protect cannot space I guess that for

299
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:17,430
example days they still don't have as

300
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:26,339
for example so you know it's hard to say
i i i personally trust OpenBSD but i

301
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:32,430
think thats Dr security response is
probably more secure but it is hard to

302
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:41,029
measure is just my intuition thank you
very much thank you
