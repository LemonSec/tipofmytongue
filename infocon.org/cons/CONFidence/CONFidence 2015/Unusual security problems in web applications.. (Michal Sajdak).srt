1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,109
clover on my name is my house I dot com
and I'll show your life somewhat I think

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:14,259
interesting web security box derby also
a possibility to win a bottle of wine

3
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:20,779
actually two bottles of wine very
connected with heightened security and

4
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:30,390
when you listen carefully you'll know
why what does swat after this is a very

5
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,480
good question I think this is winning
question for wine bottle of wine after

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:50,559
beers just father-of-two Voice year ago

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:01:02,050
I have another bottle of wine but this
is clear I I think ok about me i'm open

8
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:12,220
dust and trainings in my spare time I
blogger bid on security I also launched

9
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,890
lobster police CTF capture the flag
portal which is called

10
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:27,940
ok and the plan for today as showing
abilities in Excel platform this is

11
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:36,170
actually the first public disclosure of
the example of maybe not so obvious part

12
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:42,770
refers to cater to the noise command
execution maybe not so standard and

13
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:51,940
external probably external entity in XML
processing maybe after just a fun show

14
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:59,230
you remark on execution Davis seem
library disquiet is a bit old but

15
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:05,470
from time to time I see it is life in
many systems is quite interesting also

16
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:11,470
remote code execution through acts as
cell transformation also life and we

17
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:24,130
have to have some time also a little
bypassing filters what does this stuff

18
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,900
content management platform document
management platform targeted at

19
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:39,290
Enterprise their clients for example
they use this to stage or manager game

20
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,470
bills for example

21
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:51,340
flight industrial to fly back
information to iPad for pilots defense

22
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:59,160
industry of course communication just
read a build secure extrana debartolo

23
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,970
orange peels securit extra volatile
based on a platform I helped out

24
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:11,870
applying also fixes because this stuff
we don't showing you today is available

25
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:20,750
only in the last hotfix ok history of
the sparks were passed this year in

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,770
February they were reported by me
comment cause cancer bus and killing

27
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:31,100
from my company and share down no
details disclosed actually not sure life

28
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,970
and this will be the first public
disclosure of this box and maybe now go

29
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:44,160
this just bottles of wine because all
the reports reporting history was like

30
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,930
this

31
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,790
ok guys we found some interesting box in
your platform they said okay really nice

32
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:57,470
will be packing so what do you want for
your report and we SAT actually nothing

33
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:07,050
and they asked to drive drink so we are
sending you to create of wine and just

34
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:16,889
sent us to do or two boxes of wine and
is one example and they're not example

35
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:25,840
ok maybe enough talking let's look at
something interesting

36
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,409
curious login screen to this document
management at court and management

37
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:35,419
system and when you're deke

38
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:48,120
ACP requests here you'll see such
requests ok so maybe there is parked

39
00:04:48,120 --> 00:05:03,820
reversal here let's let's try

40
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:16,950
too easy doesn't work maybe also it
doesn't work but there's something

41
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:26,170
interesting here and I have this recipe
requests and when I put something like

42
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:38,960
this this still works so maybe they are
just future Inc double dot / which is

43
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,109
some sort of course when you want to
protect from dispatch of personality but

44
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:53,200
you should do is do this very carefully
because you can try something like this

45
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:08,340
they're free during this tough and we
can put something and went out dis

46
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:28,330
K

47
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,680
and

48
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:39,639
it works it is it's not authenticated I
can do lead all those cookies and still

49
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,060
works to get access to XML files with
password application configuration and

50
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:53,880
so on so long as the first back the
second back

51
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:14,460
requires and user account into system
admin account but any user account

52
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,680
and very basic functionality of the
system is to upload files but actually

53
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,389
defines our upload it not into two
separate so you can upload to file but

54
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:33,300
do you just can't access his access it
directly so the idea would be to upload

55
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:42,139
JSP file is Java based solution and then
somehow axes this TSB file but this is

56
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:48,080
this is out outside of the Webroot how
to make uploaded DSP fire into the

57
00:07:48,080 --> 00:08:05,270
leverage and the idea was to prepare
special zip file and I'll looks like

58
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:13,669
this as you can see the name of the file
here is prepared to have passed reversal

59
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,849
in zip file in the name to normally when
I open this file in Windows for example

60
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:32,279
I see nothing but I can edit it for
example dozen hex editor or maybe like

61
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:41,469
here using it now has a very little tool
for manipulating filenames commons and

62
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:51,800
so on so on in zip files and this famous
manipulated into this powerful Harris

63
00:08:51,800 --> 00:09:01,500
very simple JSP shell and one remaining
thing is this powerful how can we know

64
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,380
this exact powerful work through this
show for a second I'm returning to the

65
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:17,390
previous back and when I put here just
single / garbage like this it's nothing

66
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:27,360
and when I put share a single / here is
does this four-part

67
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,430
installation directory ok and I have
discussed

68
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:55,150
03 parts blow to me this shows DSP and
let's try to get a new file

69
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,689
yes they the user parser

70
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:06,770
extracted file but the sparse doesn't
check for the name and you can travel

71
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,060
sector

72
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:14,550
normally when a blood disorder file and
put this double dot / doesn't work but

73
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,920
it works this is very I think this is a
very good idea for testing or obligation

74
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:33,180
which extracts for example zips ok we
have this zip file now I'm

75
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:42,469
preview just to extract this file on the
server errors and error but I don't

76
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:51,440
cover the fires or for example or more
exactly the file has been extracted and

77
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,960
now this

78
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:10,300
ok here is our shell and the result so
normal user account uploading deuce

79
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:18,069
specifically specifically crafted zip
file and nick says basket and maybe

80
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,770
differed back here

81
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:28,220
different bike will be connected with
external I'll entities index XML else

82
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:36,040
who is familiar with the staff ok few
persons

83
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:44,389
let's get back to to my presentation and
a little interrupted us

84
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:52,130
external entities ok this is not new
stuff but many applications level and

85
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:59,420
many developer stub know about the
problems by the way does external

86
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,240
external entities tests are available
only in the latest official website very

87
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:14,269
popular weapon testing tool so it's not
widely known ok HTML we have placed

88
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,529
under entities like a person found
guilty

89
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:25,139
semicolon boorda staff and so on so on
are we can just ride it more generally

90
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:30,899
and profound entity named Sammy called
the upper silent and teaching number

91
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:40,389
chemical or copper sound X X number of
the entity and then some color looks

92
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:43,440
like this

93
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,389
HTML and when when the browser Parsons
this all those entities are displayed

94
00:12:50,389 --> 00:13:02,639
like this no problem with security in
XML you can also have entities but only

95
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:11,240
five entities are defined by default
this duty single quotable quote and I'm

96
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,120
percent in XML we can define our calling
entities

97
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,750
security problem ok and it looks like
this

98
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:31,290
doctype we have entered like declaration
and here are you using this entity and

99
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,120
after parsing the XML parser we have
discussed here

100
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,300
ok no problem with security

101
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:49,060
the problem can be here and the reason
for this problem is that we cannot

102
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,018
define a so-called external entities and
external entities cover this photo files

103
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:02,450
from the server and presenters and
present us after almost passed this is

104
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:12,690
one problem we can also make HTTP
requests so share if I put here a CDP 12

105
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:22,570
77001 parser makes an HTTP request we
can also send files from the server

106
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:30,540
using HTTP requests to our server we can
scan a bike and instructions for making

107
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:37,899
requests like this offer such interfaces
are down or not properly authenticated

108
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:52,110
other box ok let's let's see how does it
work in the lap and i have here very

109
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,620
simple application for days and then
we'll be going back to deuce nuclear

110
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:06,540
staff ok the normal function
functionality share is we are sending an

111
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:16,180
XML server Harris and name which is also
passed from client to server so we can

112
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:23,620
try to put doctype here and define
external entity too fat for example et

113
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:46,130
si password file that's right

114
00:15:46,130 --> 00:16:10,140
this is an application and let's try to
find exactly the same staff in this new

115
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:20,949
platform

116
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:55,730
I can try and here we can see sort of
XML request to the server so I am

117
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:08,690
modifying it a bit first discover now I
should use this external entities for

118
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:15,970
example

119
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:31,419
ok slog submit after skater let's say
but when I get it and put it all the

120
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:40,150
coding I see it sure is my password file
so it works and often people say that

121
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:46,970
nah nah nah nah nah all these external
entities are only possible

122
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,409
it's a Web Services request and so on a
normal applications dawn heals such

123
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:59,419
request at this is not the true and
during normal dentist I see it is very

124
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:12,380
very very ok and actually there is also
a possibility to exploit such for Napoli

125
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:20,110
tease I mean here for now believes he's
even when no information is displayed

126
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:29,408
here so I can creeper an XML which
consists of so-called parameter entities

127
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:38,210
are not aware of it is harder but it was
a person's character and i cant creeper

128
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:46,059
XML which is sent to the server and when
XML parser guess this file XML parser

129
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:51,039
also sense the contents of the file to
my server this is a bit more complicated

130
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:59,549
so I'ma leaders showing examples no live
demo by this is this is also interesting

131
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:02,600
so when you see

132
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:10,530
application processing then for 90% you
have this file

133
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,560
NTT was a problem

134
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:22,830
ok but another interesting stuff

135
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:32,020
XSLT transformation but will be going to
do this for a while and first I will

136
00:19:32,020 --> 00:21:00,470
show you this stuff and I have to kill
this machine and my Windows machine

137
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:12,750
quite common problem

138
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:21,710
application and we are performing
dependence of such application and we

139
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:28,159
are fixing box you're forgetting about
the application but for some time there

140
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:36,190
is a park in the library or Latino
library and sometimes it allows for

141
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,630
example for just hated remote code
execution and those a very interesting

142
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:49,520
back into table seemed library this is
not a bike in JBoss or job haha the

143
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,900
library and

144
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:59,110
why I chose to spark to show you today
because very often no authentication is

145
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,590
needed to exploit this vulnerability no
specific condition is needed to exploit

146
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,490
this vulnerability and the only
requirement is that the application is

147
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:18,300
using reliable library library and is
also quite easy to exploit ok our JBoss

148
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:25,710
is already running

149
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,500
ok

150
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:42,960
for tables application server I won't be
logging in and the only interesting

151
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:53,980
information here I was a bitch

152
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:00,910
the only interesting information here is
that I see login don't seem interest

153
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:09,620
news staff we also had this same library
and it was on the error I wanted to

154
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:19,199
preview Jesus desist file and the same
stuff but they're using secure version

155
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:32,860
or at least I think so this is all the
library ok well what I should do here is

156
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:39,350
there some magic if you want to have
very detailed explanation of this stuff

157
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,610
just go to to this blog and reserved

158
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:54,040
elaborate explanation of this but in
short I should locate two methods on my

159
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,770
server 2000 metals and first matter does
get runtime and the second method is

160
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:05,080
exit from get run time I put it together
and I lunch execs Rome

161
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:14,139
runtime was proper to come out how does
it work ok I copy this time I put it

162
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:24,830
here and if I always seem extension
would be ok ok and here I proved a

163
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:36,909
specific number fifteen ok status for
which is another or but I reach the

164
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:46,130
information from here from the euro and
I see shared that on the number 15 in my

165
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,090
specific

166
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:53,490
her there is a mess hot like this I
should search for discrete runtime and

167
00:24:53,490 --> 00:25:06,850
then Forex in my example these number 15
and 60 case for example out of the

168
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:16,809
running a calculator calc this very long
stream it

169
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:38,720
backing to deuce login seem now I'll try
to show you consult rock from the server

170
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:57,010
running calculator

171
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:12,080
and enter and she was the calculator
just one simple all URL and actually any

172
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:20,270
application which uses old version of
seem libraries vernal we can also see

173
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:26,400
the output of the comment directly into
euro there are some magic here will call

174
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,830
calling here

175
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:36,189
example we want to know which which
privileges story have when executing the

176
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:42,940
stuff so I get and fireman fire opal
user name and I want to have reasons to

177
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:54,900
screen in the euro zone out there are
simple URL

178
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:11,140
same and also this is and we have here
administrator in the ural so I'm running

179
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:19,080
this command US administrator so this is
very clever method for calling arbitrary

180
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:34,240
time I met lots in JBoss for novel
version ok there is a similar stuff in

181
00:27:34,240 --> 00:28:07,170
XSLT parsing this will be another demo
JBoss ok let's get back to chetori

182
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:30,820
because the dumbest thing that can be
actually and related businesses so that

183
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:38,280
doesn't stop on the server side but but
very often you can just execute

184
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,540
arbitrary code using the transformation
ok what is this

185
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,879
XSLT trust farms

186
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,410
comments into a mothering so immense and
the coming years like this so you have

187
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:59,030
for example XML which is generated user
provides

188
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:08,520
template styling and XSLT and the output
device is Gmail which has served user

189
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:20,090
for example you have such as you can see
it as this reminds display HTML HTML the

190
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:26,360
command with additional docs like this
there's this Excel document Harris

191
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,649
mental data and the result is like this

192
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,860
errors

193
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:39,820
HTML header and here we have a very
little loop which gets all those names

194
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:48,030
and emails from outside table row and
displaces in blade ATML no idea how to

195
00:29:48,030 --> 00:30:01,350
make remote code execution in very very
basic stuff . of causing job haha I live

196
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:09,709
for many crazies in their libraries it's
possible to make something like this

197
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:17,850
declare a viable as I return to come and
then again does run time this is very

198
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,909
similar to the stable same stuff we're
getting around I'm also and Dan we are

199
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:28,860
executing running function exact from
runtime just parameter cmd and when I

200
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:39,990
upload or use this cell file server just
execute arbitrary code let's see how

201
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:46,590
does

202
00:30:46,590 --> 00:31:11,480
first application is already running I
have to log into my account and this

203
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,620
little application I have a possibility
to customize colors after logging in I

204
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:23,340
thought it was my caller just upload
this file doesn't look dangerous right

205
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,428
but we can use the same excel file

206
00:31:28,429 --> 00:32:04,140
presentation as you can see I'm running
also later

207
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:30,420
and later and works by default so we
don't have to change your exercise all

208
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:42,160
powers just it works and for example in
PHP it doesn't work by default by

209
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:49,970
reading files from the server works for
by default you can do this constructs

210
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:56,280
copy off and put sure a file and you
will see sometimes the first line of

211
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:10,420
this file and sometimes more okey dokey
and the last think well by passing a

212
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,460
bill to future nurse

213
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:21,910
PHP application running and the standart
filters from blocking uploading shell

214
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:30,360
into PHP applications freezers are like
this so we blacklist certain extensions

215
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:39,969
like PHP PHP free PHP 455 peace the
amount on song and we also checking the

216
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,980
uploaded file structure so we want to
know if this applauded file is a real

217
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:54,600
image if not something is wrong we're
not sure how to bypass all both of these

218
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,980
filters

219
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:05,050
first of reserve bit tricky sometimes
works and some of a apache server us

220
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:16,929
will interpret this file actually s PHP
and dole's not so probably a stupid ass

221
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:25,190
like this this extension I don't know it
let's get one step back this extension I

222
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,889
don't know it wants the back this
extension no success and yes I know how

223
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:34,710
to process this extension and I will be
using on the only be processing this

224
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:42,040
fire ass php file not so long ago it was
default configuration of apache on

225
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:49,070
Debian Linux for example and they're
still there are many many examples which

226
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,370
used this strange

227
00:34:52,370 --> 00:35:45,299
parsing behavior it's ok we can try it
on my last application file little shell

228
00:35:45,300 --> 00:36:24,150
and now I have PHP executed the stretch
but this very very often works and how

229
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:31,260
to bypass those image library image
check validation so I can just prepare

230
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:52,270
here a little image in paint I'm saving
it just my desktop golfie

231
00:36:52,270 --> 00:37:05,259
G for example is ok for now looks like
this nothing interesting for now and now

232
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:27,390
I'm opening this file into notepad so
cute stuff like this

233
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:37,410
I'm saving the file closing yet and it
still opens as well its image in Windows

234
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:48,259
ok now I'm changing the name so they are
so

235
00:37:48,260 --> 00:38:00,690
PHP dis is important and disrupt them
stuff put her on a yes and I am

236
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:17,279
uploading this newly created file and
here we can see it is X character let's

237
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:26,630
say no problems of source we see this
file and when I click here there is

238
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:32,859
binary representation of this file and
at the end you see the car out has been

239
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:38,400
executed the brother of disperses this
first part and we parse

240
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:52,029
ok so this is perfectly good image so
validation checks if this is good gifts

241
00:38:52,029 --> 00:39:03,180
will give us ok and by using a pending
treat let's say we can execute like this

242
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:18,220
what else I have some interesting stuff
but not today unfortunately we have

243
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:25,569
already I mean the case for my company
reports some bugs in DotNetNuke just

244
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:32,520
fall out enough indicated other box this
is already shakes pot no disclosure from

245
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:41,109
now for Mom for something like this and
I also found to about interpreting

246
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:48,160
devices in multiple devices alt new
which allow me for gaining operating

247
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,440
system route such devices and disclosure
will be on security at PL Travers all

248
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:02,530
those faced questions questions I have a
question for you get this this little

249
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:11,069
bottle of wine and the questionnaires
and we had two types of XML entities

250
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:18,690
normal entities are sound external
entities with this system he worked

251
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:28,410
there was another entity type and
Reuters yes

252
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:36,620
parametric

253
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:46,900
yes yes parameter entity but parametric
assaults ok what was the character yes

254
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,530
very good so you're getting his bottle
of wine so it will be waiting for you

255
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,840
here

256
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,410
revelations ok and do you have any
questions for me

257
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:23,810
ok limits but only in PHP s because like
or dislike comment oh yes yes it could

258
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:39,950
work also for example for JSP because we
could use overboard

259
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:51,770
for example and there was also very
similar of an uplifting to stop at New

260
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:58,190
York content management system and

261
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:04,880
there was a possibility to upload your
avatar image with with dotnet called and

262
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:20,500
it worked so it's it's a sort of
universal and other questions

263
00:42:20,500 --> 00:43:04,120
was most professional presentation I
have seen what causes for now thanks to

264
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:10,720
your IIS server and when you sport coat
like this it should work

265
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:19,990
a speedy and also in aspx doesn't matter
so this binary star is usually power as

266
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:26,049
just played by there in like like normal
HTML and when you and when the parser

267
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:36,810
sees this started we are starting coding
characters just France this was the case

268
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:44,529
with dotnet DotNetNuke CMS for an
ability

269
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:56,090
yeah fck editor Amanda filters and they
know about all those stuff it was very

270
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:04,420
noble ok maybe some specific situation
if you want to see some details just

271
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:11,550
google for DotNetNuke for now please
upload avatar staff and and this is

272
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,820
written in.net

273
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:22,980
aspx ok and other questions

274
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,220
ok so thank you very much thank you very
much
