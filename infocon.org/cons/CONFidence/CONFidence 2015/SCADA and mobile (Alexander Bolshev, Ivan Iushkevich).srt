1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,670
my name is you want to ask you should I
woke us security audit in digital

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,259
security

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:13,710
my role in this research was done by a
security guy my name is Alexander by

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,880
Chef and I work as a security researcher
digital security hole PhD and also

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,070
lectures at st. Petersburg connected
Technical University and my role here

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,740
was fighting can SCADA security
considerations here is that agenda para

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:36,680
talk we will give you a very quick and
drive introduction to them ICS 101 then

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,360
we will review the types of mobile
applications talk about our testing

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,170
approaches and finished with example in
abilities and attacks that could be

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,969
conducted with such vulnerabilities and
in there and there will be a shot

11
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:59,160
conclusion so what is the ICS in most
cases when you talk about scared and he

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,429
talked about ICS because skating is just
a small part inside big industrial

13
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:15,400
control system architecture today you
can find ICS infrastructure in every

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,380
power plant factory trailer on Apple
building such as business downtown hotel

15
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,640
and even in your house to in general ICS
collects data from remote stations also

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,970
called field devices such cool devices
could be temperature sensors that

17
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,369
aggregates some value from the physical
world process is this

18
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:42,520
various and the estimated algorithms if
needed operator drive and supervisory to

19
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,720
create comments to be sent back to their
devices that called actuators that do

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,119
dirty work interacting with physical
work like switching on of the pump all

21
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:01,210
closing open gates also here are some
ICS

22
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:07,960
samples I do not know whether you see it
or no on the left there on several

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,069
transmitters quality of the screen but
you can see the transmitter on the top

24
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:22,670
and on the right there is the interface
of SCADA system and in the center there

25
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:29,170
is part of control of it I said
infrastructure a control room and here

26
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:36,660
is that typical ICS infrastructure it
divided into three layers all levels on

27
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,690
the lowest level will have PLC and
transmitters that interconnected by

28
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:49,170
industrial buses on the middle level you
have several senators with SCADA DCS

29
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:57,230
systems MS are obviously software also
human machine interface devices and on

30
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,079
the upper level you have manufacturing
execution system that interconnect their

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,500
middle and lower level of infrastructure
with the business processes with

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:15,090
earpieces corporate networks here are
some basic I see storms we already

33
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:24,160
discussed ways to give an introduction
to other times the PLC programmable

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,299
logic controllers digital system used
for automation of typically industrial

35
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:37,140
electro mechanical process in fact the
Aussies is a special devices with

36
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,369
embedded

37
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,709
computer inside their programming in
special languages that are different

38
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:52,040
from C++ and Java or C Y similar and PLC
do all automated things in SCADA and in

39
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,599
ICS so in fact in real ICS
infrastructure alternated things are

40
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:07,190
done by PLC and SCADA supervisory
control and data acquisition they agree

41
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,920
gates the whole state of industrial
process and show is to that process

42
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,099
operator on process engineer and allows
him to do

43
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,520
supervisory actions if needed the skater
shows full picture of industrial process

44
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:30,039
should make human machine interfaces are
used to show the picture inside one

45
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:35,930
point of technological process for
example what is happening on several PLC

46
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:43,090
is not the whole picture so I hope you
know you get familiar with ICS and let's

47
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,510
look at typical mobile apps place in a
centrist action with him i three groups

48
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:56,300
of mobile application it's my life and
my pen else that resists on a resides on

49
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,599
lower and middle air of the ICS file MS
clients that connects to the MS

50
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:10,090
historian and almost got a client's that
connects to scale up from Romo 10 points

51
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,030
from the corporate network also was a
internet in the control room application

52
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,948
group C you can see in three other
subgroups the application that works

53
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,680
with PLC and do configuration
interaction with them they are simple

54
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,249
replacement for old fashioned can help
communicate to us

55
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:37,879
in previous years you need to buy
expensive and help communicator now you

56
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:44,109
just install cheap mobile application on
the tablet has got a client and the

57
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:52,219
by-election my panels let's review a bit
about every group so control application

58
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:58,058
do direct configuring monitoring or
supervising industrial process or its

59
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:02,109
components this application resides
inside Safeway at least fire world in

60
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:06,909
separate from other segments network in
control room and they have full of

61
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:12,849
bottle local control of industrial
process has fought mass or historian

62
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:18,419
client's this application engineer and
process owner and managers to read and

63
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,688
interpret some data from middle or high
level of competence of ICS this data is

64
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:28,369
read only you don't have direct access
to the PLC HMI and SCADA ops in this

65
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:32,419
case and you're on their ability to read
some variables are aggregated awareness

66
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:37,128
about the most interesting group is
kinda remote control applications this

67
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:41,419
application allows remote outside of the
safe perimeter

68
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,068
even outside the plant network
monitoring controlling their industrial

69
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:50,389
process for application in this group
with on picture schemes architecture

70
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:55,309
sketches of documents from vendor where
my life is shown as a remote control

71
00:06:55,309 --> 00:07:04,049
unit outside of the plant network so
this is a bit scary but it is you can go

72
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:10,799
to some other science and see how they
proposed application that could be used

73
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,179
to

74
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,240
do a remote supervising industrial
process through the Internet or through

75
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,190
their GSM channel on to other things and
now we will discuss typical attack

76
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:37,550
vectors so there are some typical attack
vectors first of all and I think most is

77
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,509
when someone lost his smartphone or it
was stolen so it's clear to say that the

78
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,940
direct access to the new iOS four lights
take that as a director cells to the

79
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,360
consummation

80
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,400
even application itself so you can do
all their actions to the ice to serve as

81
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:07,150
a writer can do and other products so
someone go to the bar and connector his

82
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,630
new eyes to free wi-fi

83
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:17,320
attacker can intercept and directing all
the traffic so his left up so he can

84
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:26,060
intercept all the data between
application and so so for example we Kim

85
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,169
decided to change the temperature in his
house using his mobile application he

86
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:38,740
said some data and attacking intercepted
and change to another one in the same

87
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,050
way when they become returns home there
will be nothing but Asians and other

88
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:52,380
problem is unlocked phone on the table
is clear to say that if someone sees

89
00:08:52,380 --> 00:09:01,160
that his phone was stolen it was lowest
you'd do some direct actions for example

90
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,529
changing

91
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:08,160
like jeans pants we'll see if it was
installed some Scott application he'll

92
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,699
do it immediately so let's suppose I
should to Asian when they employ am NOT

93
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:18,620
his phone on the deck unlocked and go to
hell Edina

94
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:25,670
some rest for a short bit of time before
the phone for direct access for a short

95
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,579
period of time you can try to get some
useful information for him for example

96
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:38,628
the IP address of this prudential's or
try to do some malicious actions with

97
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:46,949
the help of an application if it has no
password protection also some allegation

98
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:53,029
store that data on sdcard this data can
be able to my project files

99
00:09:53,029 --> 00:10:04,920
configuration files along its sensitive
information so someone from another

100
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,959
application that have access to the
sdcard can modify information for

101
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:19,170
example it to disable all buttons in my
project file so when I try to do some

102
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,110
actions using his mobile application for
example is it a try to switch off

103
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:32,720
something wise people got no longer also
that I can try to compromise the remote

104
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:40,329
server some box it's obvious that
several applications can have it all

105
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:54,910
from SQL injections to denial-of-service
remote code execution and so on so what

106
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:02,059
other mines rose for IC classification
for controller or UPS is setting aside

107
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:03,550
and client-side

108
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:11,459
dogs when the Sura fully trust the date
of this comes from operator and the

109
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:17,930
correctness of the entire technological
brought us rely on settings and data

110
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:24,290
that are sent from the mobile
application of the operator to lick of

111
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:32,050
the data validation can result in
enormous damage also compromise or

112
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,370
stored data that could lead to endure
for a special occasion it's for my arms

113
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:43,170
from us obviously and historic lines
it's also set aside and client-side

114
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,170
orthodox

115
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,979
attacker can sniff credentials or
modified by intercepting

116
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:02,339
compromise the data protocol between
application and so so it also can affect

117
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:10,310
the entire day brought us is also
possible for example instead of

118
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:17,719
receiving application server application
that but that's ok

119
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:25,470
received no notification at all for
example some replication sees that some

120
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:34,420
sort of shows to watch operations by and
28 cents notification to a parade of

121
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:43,410
that he should russia but the attacker
can intercept it but I'm actions that

122
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,569
the operator will receive notification
about that he should increase pressure

123
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:55,540
instead of decreasing it said he can
receive nothing at all

124
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:02,899
for Sky remote control UPS is also
Glenside and several side doors process

125
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:10,250
compromised through a protocol lack of
several side all the way to a toolbox in

126
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:25,019
suicide during our first we do some

127
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:31,269
filled up some checklist the texts
contain some of some checks and that

128
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,750
provide us information about the
application itself program about how it

129
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,980
works

130
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:43,889
the purpose of it what it stores and so
on this information helps us to

131
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:52,220
understand how the application walks and
water getting security came here after

132
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,800
the entry points as we begin to file
inside and outside on the application

133
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:05,889
and in the same time to do some things
you know it help to understand how

134
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:15,740
Aurelia application walks and walked
three points at half so let's talk some

135
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:23,430
more about this checklist Bianco
research application we do some context

136
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:31,689
this helped us to every application in
their security times each checks

137
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:37,250
provided us useful information or actual
plaques that becomes a tribal lines for

138
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:44,399
further analysis for application it was
the purpose of application and what

139
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,050
protocols are used to skate Asia my bill
COPC etcetera

140
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:57,300
tell them what their missions are
required for application you think forum

141
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,079
for services as a mouse writing down on
guard and so on

142
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,570
it helped us to understand the
application can be compromised how it

143
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:16,269
can affect the other applications on
their mobile device itself also bi

144
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:21,040
analytics data we can understand whether
the application collect some extra

145
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:30,269
information from the device application
any password protection so if someone

146
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:36,579
lost his phone was stolen and I don't go
far and it can hit immediately connect

147
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:42,939
so try to do some actions as application
and in need of court it's obvious that

148
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:49,000
made an application can have much more
problems like butter or always use a

149
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,470
story and many other dangerous political
just as application anybody's companion

150
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:07,970
so we must do some checks protocol radio
certification application allows us to

151
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:13,230
communicate with so without any purpose
was lucky and so on

152
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,600
well well well we also don't have
occasion on the client or on the server

153
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,540
protocol is used water that is sent
other any cryptographic primitives are

154
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,250
used and so on

155
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:36,950
also other documents or other device
application in its request an

156
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:45,810
application use a cell so you should
check the settings of it so for example

157
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:52,290
application check the correctness of the
certificate has escaped beating it

158
00:16:52,290 --> 00:17:00,060
allows us this information allows to
know whether as a sale related docs are

159
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,290
able to do

160
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:10,579
publication use XML so either an XML
parser what is it what settings it has

161
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:17,000
no other female related box can be you

162
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:30,870
application and also also it become then
try points for fathering what story what

163
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:36,049
does application store for example

164
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:43,520
also my files drinks configuration logs
and so on

165
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:51,340
where it's stored in shared preferences
or rather this formation encrypted what

166
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,850
are they used to be putting grip it just
imagine that the direct access to the

167
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:05,040
phone or some configuration files how
fast can retrieve their critical data

168
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:19,428
from these after all this sucks we began
someone just some more areas of

169
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:25,580
application and after it will begin the
next step

170
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,040
cultivating ok now I will give

171
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:36,668
and Brian inter how to do if I think off
clients because all applications hungry

172
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:41,429
allegation against manner specific
protocols for interaction between client

173
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:47,309
and Sarah for example some such protocol
shown on the screen and fuller Avenue

174
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,990
Engineering Co said she could take
infinite time to test them easier we

175
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,290
used fighting but I think requires
regular communication between mobile

176
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,970
application and Sarah and former by
application the problem is that nobody

177
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,919
lapiz agree application in most cases it
won't interact with Sarah was Alcazar

178
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,050
comment without stepping on some
components on the screen

179
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:15,649
we just a simple solution Google Android
yet to meet her and we testing total aid

180
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:21,250
the user taps in the mobile application
however the next problem arise many

181
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:30,180
mobile application using native called
C++ compilers forearm seven and we are

182
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,220
such application also use native
elements and Google yet to meet a

183
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,880
standard matters have no support for
them as a solution and used following

184
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,790
that it on the first round of passing we
do know motivations process the

185
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,680
following Chris correct data and while
doing it

186
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:56,020
we capture serious or screenshot and put
them on case we're safe timings and

187
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,430
actions that we are doing and put it all
in cage and on the next round where we

188
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,380
started

189
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:09,000
itself when we modify the data when
we're trying to crash application we

190
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,850
detect the crashes and false by
comparing the current screen with touch

191
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:20,860
screen on catch we easily could detect
the crash here is the architecture as a

192
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:28,929
proxy we used airline part of themselves
i'm suppose and singer else also was

193
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:35,970
with you know to do intercommunication
was easily and in this case we are

194
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,110
finding application and then we are
facing Sarah of course it's motivational

195
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,179
based housing no generational based we
have no time for jewish

196
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:54,280
advising the test scenario example shown
on this slide the first function is

197
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:01,879
creates than taps on the screen in their
second year olds are there clean chain

198
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,310
of user actions

199
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:11,330
and field occasion was correct actions
and final function do the fighting and

200
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,580
check their current state with that
clean state to detect vulnerabilities

201
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:26,070
and crashes and other things so how it's
locked that isn't very good but here we

202
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:35,210
are facing their mobile communicator to
their Simmons log on programmable logic

203
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:42,260
controller and finally we tested about
20 application here is the list

204
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:48,850
application from several types it's a
control application mass clients and

205
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,080
remote Scottish clans and what we have
to sign a result it was a bit shocked

206
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:02,010
and scary because controller litigation
as we've settled right it around in the

207
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:08,420
safe perimeter so I expected that most
of the box and witness will be in

208
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,640
control implication however most
weaknesses and vulnerabilities found in

209
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:21,330
SCADA remote clients so the application
that connects to the ICS infrastructure

210
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,310
from outside of the safe perimeter that
connects remote endpoint that could be

211
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:32,010
easily compromised have the most of
vulnerabilities and weakness and that's

212
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:41,230
that's strange I don't understand while
isn't happened but it is here is the

213
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:48,290
test results summary we have a bunch of
quantification problems found some

214
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,010
cryptic problems

215
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:56,120
sequel injection Daniel of services
possible memory corruptions and related

216
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,040
bikes and of course we can't show you
the exact vulnerabilities because a

217
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,360
responsible disclosure and responsible
disclosure process for ICS application

218
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,219
is hard

219
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,970
and fixing the vulnerability could take
years I have a vulnerability in SCADA

220
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:21,510
systems that now fixing for three years
and still not fixed so we will not

221
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:26,309
disclose any vulnerability because
irresponsible disclosure but we will

222
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:31,960
show you the screenshots of this
vulnerability is always cut it

223
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,580
vendors loggers and any characteristics
that could point you at exact

224
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:50,699
application but we'll show you something
at least about 30% of all research

225
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,600
applications has some problems

226
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:11,030
cleartext some problems with rights
notification itself many of them so each

227
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:18,080
type of client there are some litigation
problems so let's see if some of them

228
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,629
first

229
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:27,450
the plaintext on station some
applications sent both worlds

230
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:37,110
user logins in clear text format so that
I can intercept this data you can

231
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:42,600
can get confidential so easily and
connect to the server and do some

232
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,510
actions so just lighting and see if the
couple such applications that do so they

233
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:58,120
even do so over insecure channel so if
some of us may try to do some actions in

234
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:32,809
bar or free wi-fi that I can easily get
this information to go on

235
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:54,700
that connects to the point and I was
curious because Jess and channel is safe

236
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,830
you can google and see how GSM could be
easily faked and compromise GSM and GPRS

237
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:06,449
not guilty of course and after it I go
to the Google Play

238
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:13,309
type SCADA type ICS and get a bunch of
the application and it was an idea

239
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:19,129
what's about security of such
application is it safe to use them in

240
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:28,428
the real world and as we said it's not
safe let us continue so the user

241
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:33,789
credentials are was provided by the
application itself so another funny

242
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:42,539
moment let's hear while complications it
helped us to understand how so

243
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:49,499
applications are really walks and two
are too weak points they had for example

244
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:56,789
applications first checks there are no
this over after that he tries to like

245
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:05,799
ends on the user name nobody wants is
nothing and the sort of response

246
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,200
configuration file

247
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:19,129
communication between begins so we use
this information we can understand that

248
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:25,500
if they're so it is not properly
configured that I can get

249
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:32,590
access to it without anybody else just
username and so on

250
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:42,540
the data is encrypted and all the
information that I sent to the server is

251
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,480
also created there are some problems

252
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:54,540
storing the case on this slide you can
see some medications that help some hard

253
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:04,180
court case that I used to encrypt data
it's a shame I doubt whether its

254
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:12,770
configuration on our side its
communication and so on so it's clear to

255
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:19,470
say that no matter how their
crystallographic algo reason is strong

256
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:26,470
slightly possibility of obtaining the
case the strains of the cryptographic

257
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:34,540
algorithm in these cases as in all its
what to say that some of this case are

258
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:43,180
really easy to crack there are about six
symbols but those are really pretty hard

259
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:49,660
no matter they start in the binary
travelers and see them in the binary or

260
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,970
moral there are several custom

261
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:58,560
inclement implementations as you can see
this genius Lee algorithms on the first

262
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,850
step you do get the possible to get it
to the upper case and then you

263
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,689
interactively soaring it and

264
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:16,150
do estimation in fact that complexity of
such key is less than 2 million so you

265
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:21,830
and modern computer you can you could
cricket in a matter of minutes or

266
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:39,399
seconds or so so so they're off on some
households who now build on this land

267
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:46,660
agency as I'm sure my application that
helps to meet all possible big turkey

268
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:55,930
Reuters that tacit consent and some may
get some unusual had us sold

269
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:03,160
applications won't receive begins to
consume all brought us our trespasses

270
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:14,170
and after some time to begin start to
respond so if you know IP address of the

271
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:25,180
server can easily a crash that brought
us on the touring that both spouses yes

272
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:38,490
but not only a society will hold tryouts
R Us Weekly inside is also listen to a

273
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,070
specific bought and sent broadcast
messages and listen to response there

274
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:52,080
tried to find us a row and connectors a
subnetwork so that I can response to

275
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,199
requests for specific Baker that also
contains unusual so the application will

276
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:07,540
correct it can be used to disable all
mobile operators in specific subnet

277
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:15,060
specific subnet so also if you can see
it this application using the native

278
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:29,270
code though this much more beer for
example double free vulnerability and to

279
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:34,780
be some research that I can even get to
remote code execution on the client's

280
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:44,139
site so he can exploit oil operators in
the subnet and I want to get something

281
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,740
for example are most of such application
around in the ground on the phone and

282
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:56,890
receiving some data from the remote
system to notify operator if something

283
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:07,360
gone bad but at least they're UDP port
in background and attacker could

284
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,709
silently disabled this application just
by sending this packet and application

285
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:18,440
will crash was no vacation and operator
could continue to think that application

286
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,530
is still running and they undertook want
to demonstrate to show you a couple

287
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:30,540
attack scenario the first attack is
insufficient validation of input

288
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:37,110
parameters from mobile application and
it happened when Sarah side thinks that

289
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:43,020
all parameters should be checked on the
client site and to this attack at a care

290
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,530
either should be connected to the
network with budget clients era in case

291
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:54,430
she he should be in control room or any
other remote control point and have a

292
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,300
little icon credentials or if attacker
could somehow intercept the connection

293
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,550
between client and server and point for
example through wifi

294
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:12,940
public wifi compromise to private life I
faked GSM channel attacker could meet

295
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,860
them in the connection with this error
in most simple case using our press

296
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:25,330
pushing and legitimate request goes to
the Sarah it could be modified

297
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:32,610
i cant the parameter name from this
quiet so you can google it but it could

298
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:39,560
be Google in fact and this worry is
setting the temperature limit upper

299
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:45,040
temperature limit and in this
application said the upper temperature

300
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,710
limit in home automation room for
example of course this could be sat in

301
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,760
the factory this application also runs
for power plants and of course this

302
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,100
there will be no catastrophe of course
the physical controls will be in action

303
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,610
and stop the process however process
alarm or process fault is also dangerous

304
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:13,540
because if technological process or
industrial process false arrest starting

305
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:20,000
the process could be could cost much
money for the business sometimes that

306
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,370
we're starting the process after fault
takes days maybe weeks or even months

307
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:34,989
and now the interesting attack that is
possible is compromising their passion

308
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,668
myself as we said earlier several
several application and she might

309
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:44,779
databases circuit interfaces connection
parameters and project on sdcard if I

310
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,040
should my project data somehow
compromised for example by virus and

311
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,009
other application vulnerability for
example application was compromised

312
00:34:53,010 --> 00:35:00,110
through the double for you direct access
to the sdcard from PC or if there is the

313
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,050
cat was walked intentionally

314
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:09,610
operator puts the phone on the table and
someone who Chris what does the card

315
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:13,600
that I can slightly thickened
reconfigure a change there are some

316
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,600
minor phrase they could replace company
announced and logical for example

317
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,380
sensitive data sources and now the
unsuspecting operator is compromised and

318
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:29,560
could make a wrong decision for example
here is the original item i interface of

319
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:36,370
some system it's a subsystem where it
goes from one town to another and they

320
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:43,230
got shows at their current level in the
second tank in normal case the process

321
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:47,560
is fully automated by programmable logic
controller but in case of supervised

322
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:55,920
decision will have two buttons stop and
start the process and here is how it

323
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,570
started

324
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:02,600
I don't know whether you see it or not
so here is several Japan majors and any

325
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:08,279
files and it could be started in a
simple like four months

326
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:18,550
excuse me let me like four months or it
could be encrypted by but the keys are

327
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:24,980
stored inside the binary so it could be
easily decrypt on forest and attacker

328
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:30,830
could reconfigure and he could connect
the garage to another

329
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:39,390
tank and change the functionality of
battles of course all will be ok

330
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:45,230
the system will continue to work but if
some event accuracy where manual super

331
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:52,640
region will be needed and engineer will
press top button but it will start that

332
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,109
could cause some alarm a fault one
physical controls will stop their

333
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,410
technological process to prevent the
explosion for example are a huge damage

334
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:09,980
but also as I said earlier the fault
could be could be dangers in fact it

335
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:16,550
could look like this of course it's a
good pair belong but it could be like

336
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:23,790
this if physical controls are also fail
and here is a conclusion we review of

337
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,350
220 Android application and not even one
was free of weaknesses and

338
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,950
vulnerabilities the most dangerous
consequences of this vulnerability is

339
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,390
compromising the operator for example
give him a false understanding the

340
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:42,200
current industrial process state skate
in ICS came to the Mumbai award recently

341
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:48,359
about brought all the branches and all
witnesses and I hope that you too

342
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,000
rapidly developing nature of mobile
software all these problems will soon be

343
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:02,010
gone and several proposing we used
alongside and extensions for Google

344
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:08,130
Android you have to make time whereas
engineering degree and white shark and

345
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:14,650
several boxes here are some links
up-to-date white paper sources and

346
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,840
diners will be published in the middle
of the gym and here is there a

347
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:25,930
repository off additional based browser
proxy proxy want to thank you to redeem

348
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,940
the king of the head of digital research

349
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,970
digital security research group for some
binary magic and great help in the race

350
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:40,680
engineering of native called and marina
critical for some bright ideas on ICS

351
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,180
threats and if you have any more
questions where the thompson thank you

352
00:38:45,180 --> 00:39:51,029
yes because of course we could we don't
ask-don't application for control

353
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:58,040
application because it's a safe
environment education in the control

354
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,920
room but for

355
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,380
noncontrolling application seeks
applications failed to a haunted on

356
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,340
ticket at all so they use either plain
text on vacation has a note on vacation

357
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:17,770
or either username on vacation and they
are all week as a cell and other things

358
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,940
isn't on this site

359
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:26,100
application users which has a built-in
cryptic is and other terrible things so

360
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:38,299
most of all has problems with on two
occasions and i was just curious yes I

361
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:45,830
couldn't tell what I think most of them
vulnerable in either one on either way

362
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:51,180
but I couldn't tell you what exactly
this application and lots more abilities

363
00:40:51,180 --> 00:41:00,460
because responsible disclosure I have a
question regarding the vendor response

364
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:07,600
to these how receptive were they in turn
around for patches which some several

365
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:15,470
reports of Arabia still have almost no
reaction just from Siemens but since I

366
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:23,649
really good guys and they always do it
fast and even when we publish

367
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:29,980
Dr description to confidence they sent
me a letter did you find some

368
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,220
vulnerabilities

369
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:39,390
was first and they always do it good but
still waiting an answer this could take

370
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:46,580
immediate infinity as I said once Keita
bug that I found three years ago still

371
00:41:46,580 --> 00:42:00,100
isn't fixed it and i couldnt still
disclosing

372
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,210
operations
