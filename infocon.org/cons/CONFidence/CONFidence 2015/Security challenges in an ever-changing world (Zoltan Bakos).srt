1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,069
I'm soda bottles from Bala bit and we
are a Hungarian vendor and you might

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:14,730
have heard about us let me start the
four-story fifteen years ago there was a

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:24,779
guy who thought about what to write for
his teases and it turned out that he had

4
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,689
no good tools for log management so he
decided to write software for that

5
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:31,510
purpose

6
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:38,350
this to Paul's sister Kenji this is what
you might know is well known and open

7
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,270
source community and this is our leading
products for log management and we've

8
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:50,879
all just introduced in a few months to
the market product called transporter

9
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,320
which is great too

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:02,500
to analyze the behavior of users it is
great to let you see the anomalous to

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:09,840
let you see where to focus on and today
we've all talked a bit about a control

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,479
box we will talk about that solution
where he is a privilege activity

13
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:23,039
monitoring at all and how many of you
know what this is

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,299
hands up everyone who knows that oh I
think there are more people please tell

15
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:30,189
me what this is

16
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:37,658
yes exactly so shocked control box is
like the black box for the eighth

17
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:47,600
infrastructure its security device and
it helps challenged us to learn more and

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,119
more about

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,240
requirements which are changing but
before I get into death let me explain

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,839
what shall control box does so it's
basically transparent proxy based

21
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,360
solution which takes the connection
request from the client side

22
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,650
Creuset and our stores and after re-
encrypting it gets forwarded to the

23
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,220
server side this happens also the other
way around so we perform a friend

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,880
so-called friendly man in the middle so
you understand why it's really important

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:32,430
to be well prepared for requirements in
terms of security for our customers

26
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:42,010
before I go on let me show you how
amazing this is in real life to do that

27
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:52,730
will open an RDP connection to a
completely normal Windows Server and

28
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:14,089
right after moving dad over to dad
desktop session behaves exactly like

29
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:23,770
this session would act without an
appliance I will just quickly create

30
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:34,230
some content that you see that this is
exactly what we will see when I replayed

31
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:44,320
a session and it's really simple to
replay such recordings as you might

32
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:52,970
recall we are in between the client and
the server and we offer the transparent

33
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:59,579
way to replay to record and an easy way
to replay the sessions I recorded all

34
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,930
already have already recorded some
special

35
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:12,939
but easily browse through the recorded
sessions for now have all look forward

36
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:20,779
confidence because I remember that I
entered it as you see and we immediately

37
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:31,830
see the results we see it was entered
here just like if we would sit behind

38
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,508
administrator and if it is interesting
for us we can immediately replay it in

39
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:46,440
our browser that's i think thats
fantastic because it's really a great

40
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:54,599
tool to replay the sessions and there's
also one thing which makes it really a

41
00:04:54,599 --> 00:05:09,229
great security tool for you if open SSH
connection for example they want to

42
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:18,180
login I haven't started tutor and how
it's also able to protect your

43
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:27,250
infrastructure but why is that neither
you must know the things we used to use

44
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,460
to solve our security challenges are

45
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,739
challenging task not really usable
anymore because we can't really put a

46
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,539
fence around are important service
anymore

47
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:50,009
computers are in the cloud and
third-party administrators are accessing

48
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:56,009
our servers we don't have such a tight
control over security offer

49
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:02,090
infrastructure anymore that like the
used to have so to keep our system safe

50
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:10,549
and secure is an ongoing challenge for
you as administrators as people who are

51
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,009
dealing with

52
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:19,379
security incidents on a daily basis and
also for us as a vendor to provide the

53
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:25,770
best tools for you to successfully
address those challenges and it's also a

54
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:31,909
big responsibility because if something
malicious happens then you're the ones

55
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:41,180
whose name is on the line and afterwards
we are the ones who you claim to not

56
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:50,539
helping you in having a secure safe and
secure system but you think why me why

57
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,169
would anybody

58
00:06:53,169 --> 00:07:00,279
hack my systems why would I be to target
this can happen for several reasons

59
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:07,840
let's say on a boring Saturday afternoon
some script kiddie decides to try out

60
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:17,080
his new tools and they pick your service
to mess around with or you have a third

61
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,508
party company who are doing
administrative services for you and they

62
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,139
decide to find out more

63
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,020
confidential information about the
company then you could provide them by

64
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:39,560
yourself or you work for a company who
has really important data and provide

65
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:50,039
crucial services and some hackers are
paid to find the weaknesses and weak

66
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,438
points of your security infrastructure
all those could be applied to any of us

67
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:05,810
so what could we do the most important
thing is to do everything to stop these

68
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:14,210
attacks to make it as difficult as
possible for them to gain access to your

69
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:22,659
systems to your date up its it seems
like an impossible task impossible task

70
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:34,039
but let's see if we could address this
if we could stop those attackers as

71
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,439
you know when you have your
infrastructural publicly available when

72
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:51,220
you when you offer services which can be
reached by people not system itself

73
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,810
where you need to another

74
00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:01,239
system around it where you can put
borders in protecting it from

75
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,050
unauthorized access but you can harden
the system you can put layers before it

76
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:14,660
to make it difficult to reach such a
layer could be let's say our solution we

77
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:25,630
have hardened appliance shop control box
especially to make it really difficult

78
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:36,779
for you guys want to access your system
to gain access to that we focused on

79
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:48,040
those parts wear something could be
exploited and we also want to offer you

80
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:56,709
a different concept because if you apply

81
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,980
needed level of trust where it needs to
be applied and you have two healthy

82
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,750
level of mistrust where it needs to be
there then it's an easier task when do

83
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:15,710
you need to put your trust in first of
all you need to trust your co-workers

84
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:22,560
you need to trust the people who have
normal access to your servers you need

85
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:30,300
to trust the vendor that he does
everything in his power to provide hard

86
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,609
and security tool to make towards the
tax really difficult and you need to

87
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:45,480
have some healthy mistrust in the
direction of the people who let's say

88
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,760
our outsourced people and you have only

89
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,170
some isolates and some legal contracts
that protect your infrastructure and of

90
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:05,209
course this will change the whole
picture because right now as security

91
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:13,130
approaches used to be I like that that
you have tight control from a technical

92
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:20,140
perspective over what is going on in
your system if someone has access to

93
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:27,620
your resources and what with this
approach with the solution like that

94
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,870
features hardened

95
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:38,350
for your purposes you can let go a bit
of the control you can allow your

96
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:45,980
trusted people more and even you're a
bit mister so people can can have bigger

97
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:55,420
possibilities but still with having
everything audited having everything

98
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:02,260
recorded gives you a level of
observation which is like the flight

99
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:16,930
data recorder you have seen previously
so what what is what is really important

100
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:29,760
in this area that you need to find ways
to address those changing requirements

101
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:37,460
you find tools that helps you to address
these and you need to always educate

102
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:45,350
yourself you need to quit question the
Wonder to make sure that they really

103
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,380
they're really aware of your needs and
they really want to provide you with the

104
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,840
tools which you which will make you

105
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:10,210
successfully successful and yeah that's
that's what I want to leave here today

106
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:19,890
as a message those three important
things always find a way to be a step

107
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:28,770
ahead of the cybercriminals of the
militias attackers always surround

108
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:35,910
yourself with people who you can trust
that they are reliable and always get

109
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:43,670
the tools which makes it possible for
you to achieve safe and secure

110
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:51,670
infrastructure thank you very much for
listening to those thoughts and thank

111
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:59,079
you for being here and you all if you
have more detailed questions about this

112
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:09,870
new approach of observation instead of
control or the technologies we are

113
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,150
offering you you can find us at our
proof and you can also visit our web

114
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:25,610
page on the internet do you have any
questions if not then thank you very

115
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,640
much for being here
