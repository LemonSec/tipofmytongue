1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
so i thought id is very strong guys
potency in English not impose the

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,940
following image then I'm sorry for its
peak something wrong if you don't

hackerspace messaging resume and all the
content of the recessions public

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,969

we're not talking nothing and no one so
it's about me something about me but I

8
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:59,270
will talk about very first and i know i
working to expand hearing your call I'm

9
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,320
a celeb sponsored research group I have
to search for occasions of offensive

10
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:16,100
security and learning some events that I
have thought it'd be happy it's great

11
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,130
confidence in my city thats I was the
founder

12
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:28,310
orders conference 8280 its bigger
conference in Brazil I was Speaker I

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,689
have of course confidence in his ear and
I have some contributions contributions

14
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,389
for al-qaida Linux format exploit to
have some quotes in the corner of the

15
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:50,979
mat expired and I was 18 expect a tester
it's about me so hard to start talking

16
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:59,030
about the back door the back toward in
the standoff device not that it's a new

17
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,130
subject now we know we have our office

18
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:10,489
back doors in this kind of device and
read some news about the devices with

19
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:20,730
backdoor had gotten better funding the
nazis natcore and other new news about

20
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,609
this kind of stuff and Victor fronting
the link halter's

21
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm speaking Portuguese sorry so how can
see it a better thing that this kind of

22
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:42,780
device not a new subject but we will
cost another focus when you founded this

23
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:53,630
kind of stuff in the vice so the idea
about the back door itself then here is

24
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:01,239
the back door that we found in the
device the back toward is plain text

25
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:07,650
when you make a download of the final
configuration you can see the back door

26
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,720
inside of this fire thing i det duty did
it it's very shameless for me because

27
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,769
it's plain text the guy don't use not
cryptography knowing coating them

28
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:27,200
nothing just write the text and you can
dump this you can see the back door they

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,959
again the fire estranged from you
because the guy put tried to black door

30
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,980
in the file then you have a back door
here in the back door here so for each

31
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:54,929
user you have a take back during the
fire and we discuss this so you have a

32
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,709
lot of users inside of the device but
take a look at you mean you have admin

33
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:08,480
user you have better door again have a
priority for the user so you have the

34
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,079
same user to me but you can see the
password is different and they're better

35
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,900
off leg

36
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:25,179
is different this is the normal Adam
user ok and better off ladies 0 in the

37
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,680
kids a better tour is one in the
priority is one sounded different

38
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:43,000
softwares users is only flag and
priority flag ok so if you want to

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,289
transform normal using the back door is
very simple

40
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:57,419
you get the user change the priority and
change the flag perfect you have you

41
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:03,299
already have a user your device of
course you need to save the file and

42
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:13,860
import the file to device ok so let's
analyze the device it's the real device

43
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,780
it's in my home in Brazil so it's very
strange because you see

44
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:31,549
device don't have factories that have
nothing that explain about this device

45
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,770
you have just attacking outstretched

46
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:46,049
we will see this is the target in my
device and it is original tag by

47
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:54,490
Givenchy Givenchy yes be counted the big
ESP my country ok it's dark it's very

48
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:05,970
strange to me it's our trio tag ok so
this device it was approved by a naughty

49
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:14,270
naughty always the Brazil national
telecommunications agency and its was

50
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,870
approved by a nutshell it's a very
strange because the devices don't have

51
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:30,700
actually don't have information about
this device and you have to search for

52
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,520
occasion here you can see three
companies that

53
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:47,139
side of the process of the device can
see this here by technology

54
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:57,900
a key here we have observed a telecon
yukio we have showings in telecom and

55
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:09,270
smart bigger by technology developed any
other observatories e change then call

56
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:20,120
limited its China its Spanish its
Brazilian company so about using the

57
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:30,770
Google Maps I look for the others by
taking Brazil and you can see the hour

58
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,359
is a severe do number

59
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:43,000
Centre Street its treating with you ok
and I go to the Google Maps to ok Google

60
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,860
Maps show me it's a fail oh it's very
strange because it's not look like a

61
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:56,270
telecom company for me to the stage for
ok maybe the Google Maps wrong right and

62
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:10,000
the you do have the number for the ok ok
maybe Google Maps it's wrong

63
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:21,009
know what's wrong it's a real number and
have her ok then very strange

64
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:31,589
so when you look for shares in companies
you read this tight decides

65
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:36,610
very nice site is very cool side but
seizing not manufactured and distributed

66
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:49,360
devices like this change in just 2 led
by this company is in the process with

67
00:08:49,360 --> 00:09:00,860
the Nautilus company because they don't
make it late ok let's go we have two

68
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,990
companies at this time

69
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:15,399
keep going so when you put it on your
device you can see the observer Telecom

70
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:22,880
is the femur device ok let's take a look
of several telecom site it's the

71
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:31,269
observer telecom site just a logo or
nothing you don't have links you don't

72
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:41,649
have tax you don't have nothing in the
site and they're looking for keeping the

73
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:51,120
internet and I found it is May 7 at the
observatory compound yes ok vile try to

74
00:09:51,120 --> 00:10:01,260
send him a guy I sent 11 the majors and
of course

75
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:10,810
III I think I thought I thought the GvG
and care about this device and I got to

76
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:18,180
the Givenchy and my my devices broken
modifies discretion I needed to start a

77
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,079
few more I need more information about
the device also this device not

78
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:33,100
supported by our by how you you guys
started this device my home how you

79
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,350
don't support knows that device not
supported

80
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:45,520
did very strange because of the deputy
going home and start device your house

81
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,230
and the companies don't have support
don't have spotted the device so we

82
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,830
should not believe me you can see in
this link it's in Portuguese but the

83
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:03,070
Maltings least you have a lot of models
that submitted support of course my more

84
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:18,550
than not in the list so looking for of
course we don't know one i I found the

85
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:25,490
femur okay when you open the fumes in
the exodus small boats you can see the

86
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,500
string typically Inc

87
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:41,610
so we have we have achieved we have
changing now we have a PayPal Inc

88
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:50,260
so the backdoor passwords it's very very
cool because you have less to that

89
00:11:50,260 --> 00:12:00,930
address but the street I rock on my feet
out the Google may be the default

90
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:10,180
password ok it's the mighty vice versa
would know replica of the Google

91
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:19,010
after this I look for IRA code below
let's go let's let's take a look at the

92
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:25,720
Google to search our local ok ok yes I
don't exist

93
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,040
ok I like looking what business
directory nice hope maybe I found it

94
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,449
there

95
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:42,320
the guy that put the battery in my house
I go to the side of the road is for sale

96
00:12:42,320 --> 00:13:00,579
yes or say good let's go the less
available seat of my 2005 ok it's the

97
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:07,540
site of the very nice not have humor
don't have nothing I was at the Wayback

98
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:16,990
Machine it's either decide so it's a
very interesting thing because you can

99
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,170
see the message phone number

100
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:29,380
ok the same number of device in the GVT
used the serial number of course for

101
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:36,230
your WiFi best would if you know the
device a non-member you connecting

102
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,710
device for your neighborhood for you or
for any company

103
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:54,890
and my last octet yes give it to me to
use these last two updates to name off

104
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:04,330
your WiFi network ok so if you sniffing
the networking around your house around

105
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:10,590
of your company if the guys using this
device you have the last two acted and

106
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:20,890
the password is funded by to let you get
off their marketers then it's very easy

107
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:31,750
to intrude into the device ok so I
opened the box

108
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:39,010
company in the process because the ships
that of the devices made by health tech

109
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:55,100
so we are taking input during device I
don't know because they so I set off

110
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:03,840
back door if you log in the back door
after any mapping is better I see a lot

111
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:13,100
of open ports in the have SSH Telnet and
the turnout is my first this case so you

112
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:22,520
have a gmail user to user is admin
persuaded CBT 12345 and have this is the

113
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:29,410
screen ok if you try to use the commons
logging

114
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:40,839
ok so if you do argue with the back
toward the same user just put this

115
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,130
password you found in the file you have
this list of comments

116
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,720
ok a lot of comments

117
00:15:50,720 --> 00:16:02,730
more normal so in the back door you have
loading show comment did you can see all

118
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:11,530
the users and all the passwords in clear
tasting your device is very very nice so

119
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:19,110
if I have been users you can seating
uses and then passwords and priority how

120
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:28,140
you can see the priority one is for a
demeaning it is a backdoor password

121
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:34,140
different number because I have tested a
lot of devices to make sure to have sure

122
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,650
this is not the best way it was a
different person but backdoor password

123
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:55,370
so it's very interesting because you can
do what the device's memory ok ended up

124
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:02,250
in a conference I found it at China's
linked to make a redirection to Chinese

125
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,439
company

126
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:15,339
China's link direct on my device ok you
can see username storage device it's

127
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:22,178
that name is normal name in Brazil meets
from 6 it's in storage device like a

128
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:32,179
network of names if you don't know your
device here they start out of the WiFi

129
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:39,600
networks around and turn off and moved
to another place you can see the same

130
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:48,889
wireless network so it stays started in
the device wide device story to the

131
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,809
networks around me I don't know

132
00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:04,460
so in summary you can see a lot of
credentials in clear text in the device

133
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:11,700
it's a lot of several of Givenchy
riveting make communications and you can

134
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:20,830
see the best word here here in Fort will
have more but just the speakers have to

135
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:39,158
pass some users here and here so it's
page when you login in the device ok

136
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:46,340
it's up for backdoor user it's a pin for
normal use it ok if you tried to direct

137
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:58,139
access to the web access using the HTTP
you can not found the fire but if you

138
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:03,969
force the files you can see you can find
a lot of files like a piece that start

139
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:18,929
in the the orders so strange because a
lot of devices both the the market

140
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:24,990
device normal have a user admin password
or admin password is this kind of stuff

141
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:37,149
but this device has fractured you have a
Givenchy 12345 best would change the

142
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:40,529
feel of course because it's very hard

143
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:49,180
used to have this kind of passed would
normally ok

144
00:19:49,180 --> 00:20:03,070
so outside of the back door it's it's
very interesting because we have 5600

145
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:13,310
exposes device it to my first search in
the shoulder it's open for internet it's

146
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:22,830
very expose it to expose it and I make I
i should I P and connected you can see

147
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:33,620
the run I P here you can see the less
you are ok the macro test two acted and

148
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:47,399
data access we'll ask Asian user admin
the password 2533 and inside off the

149
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:59,610
device for when the people around the
world and so I can change anything in

150
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:05,439
the device then I'm continuous
configuration I can change deniers

151
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:15,420
second changed the device you have
hooting device ok so

152
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:26,160
some updates are on to you when you are
on your later this research observer

153
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,010
telecommute today to the site

154
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:34,530
ok and have some informations and here
we can see the geometry is a partner

155
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:43,670
have more parties in Brazil like View
California boy it's there are companies

156
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:52,810
in Brazil so you can think this device
is warning that have the back door

157
00:21:52,810 --> 00:22:02,720
have more ok so I try to contact the
tried to contact the observer again

158
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,910
asking for FEMA ask for donations this
kind of stuff and of course it they

159
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:20,160
don't happen again so how to fix this
problem you can't change the back door

160
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:28,900
flag ok save the file and upload the
file again to the device you never visit

161
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:35,000
the factory default if you were
resurrected the flag will back you of

162
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,570
course suits able to access or so then
you can have different so

163
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:52,899
considerations about this is his search
out anyone out as additive to your

164
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,810
device

165
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:03,159
20 nice so but test your device you
don't know what the company is doing

166
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:12,860
inside of your device ok this 5,000
people don't have idea with the company

167
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:26,990
is doing ok so they can put the back
door in my house was DaVinci

168
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:35,630
thing was so the idea I don't have a
deal and put a big tournament mode how

169
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:50,820
to know some guys told me that USA put
the back door ended and the right of the

170
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:58,070
channel link it to the armor was changed
by China that would take I stood me

171
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:08,090
about the Givenchy employers the stories
about this but they did a good idea is

172
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:17,230
it is very hard to find it very hard to
to find who put the back door and no one

173
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:27,840
tried no one no one test your own device
here who took people's our ride they

174
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:37,230
have to device then it's very thing
through two and three times so someone

175
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:46,490
have my idea to put the best time I know
that ok

176
00:24:46,490 --> 00:25:04,400
so it's my contact anyone have
questioned its a problem it's really a

177
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:14,460
problem but I think he'll have GVT
problems the end up several problems

178
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:28,800
because they work together and but I'm
not sure okay so it's not a technical

179
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:37,370
talk but is to open your eyes when do
you buy a device in test devising stress

180
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:44,860
device because maybe someone is spying
you may be directly or trafficking maybe

181
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:55,709
grab your informations ok it's what they
had to write because my my keyboard

182
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:08,260
don't have the discharge so any question
any idea sorry

183
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,660
change the world

184
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:21,880
yes of course of course I burned the
device

185
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:36,380
so yes you can use W W 80 something like
that you can you start since your device

186
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:45,840
but this device not support if you can
use the open source of operational

187
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:57,010
system is very nice way to remove this
ok guys so thank you
