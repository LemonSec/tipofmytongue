11
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:05,129
thank you good morning my name is not as
growth in China commander of the seven

12
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,820
defense units of the National Guard
flatware let's say first of all I

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,600
understand it in poland are all such
thing as a voluntary military force like

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,979
national guard's desk now

15
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:29,810
informal but they're not not tied to the
military I am not sure who you're asking

16
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,670
about we we have something like
voluntary reserve forces that's what

17
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:42,590
you're asking ok I'm speaking about
militarized force who can provide

18
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:50,130
assistance when when it is needed let me
start with hugely the motivational slide

19
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:58,009
of the cyber realm of Latvia as you can
see there are a lot of institutions who

20
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:07,680
are responsible for a lot of things to
go around but there is also this little

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,890
box here it's called some defense unit
of last year or two main clients are

22
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:19,720
certainly who are responsible for
overall picture of the internet

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,150
situation in Latvia and national forces
and the cyber defense unit electorate is

24
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,510
part of the National Armed Forces
National Guard is one of their let's say

25
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:38,109
with the landforms this Navy Air Force
and also there is not National Guard

26
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,660
let's not make this with the reserve
because the voluntary forces they have

27
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,859
their tasks in the B standard have that
in the war time they are not like called

28
00:02:49,860 --> 00:03:01,260
in to feel in the blank space as
something happens ok

29
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:08,379
did you read have you had the
opportunity to read the book of our to

30
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:19,269
Haley airport anyone right so what
happens when there is snow storm in the

31
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:28,129
airport a blizzard you have just sold a
couple of small tracts not the couple of

32
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:32,980
food probably dozens but the snowstorm
is going on and on and on what happens

33
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:43,089
with the airport as well

34
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:51,930
airport closes and all the flights are
redirected to other other airports let's

35
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,440
talk about what happens

36
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:03,200
really bad situation happens in the
cyber cyber space in the country you can

37
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,790
just shut down the country you just
cannot say well it's winter and

38
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:15,150
everybody's freezing well go to the
other country and get your warm there

39
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:23,840
you have to stand your ground as I shot
before many institutions are responsible

40
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,060
for many different things but there are
just so many resources of the country

41
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,740
they can provide and there are just so
many people who can do that nobody

42
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:42,460
prepared for the worst-case scenario for
for everyday situation but when the

43
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,039
crisis struck what happens you need to
reserve in cyber in poland what is the

44
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,870
reserve

45
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,919
search of Sirte fall on the run out of
the resources army run out of the

46
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,070
resources what happens

47
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:08,390
who comes in who can answer

48
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:19,000
ok well the model in Latvia was that we
want to provide opportunity for the

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,990
talented people to give their share for
the state security but not interrupt

50
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,650
with their everyday life we don't want
to call them to the military pay them

51
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:37,179
five times less and say you have to do
this and that we don't need them every

52
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,300
day but when something happens we need
them so you have to do something in the

53
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:50,750
really smart manner to involve them
niggers if there is critical in

54
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,320
infrastructure in danger

55
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,860
do you really want someone from the
street come in and help you know you

56
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,910
have to check their background because
to check their skills you have to know

57
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:13,240
what they can do and cannot do so the
model in Latvia is based on the platform

58
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,680
of the National Guard of Latvia as you
can see their legislature was already

59
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,330
there before we started to create this
unit National Guard of Latvian is

60
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,930
integral part of the national forces
with them to involve citizens of the

61
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,180
Republic of Latvia and the protection of
the state I mean land territory and the

62
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:40,790
interests of the society so it falls
under this interest of the society

63
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:50,960
fortunately right so what is the main
reasons for the people to join this has

64
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,580
all the mention one is to give some
contributions to disturb state security

65
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,370
you live here you like this country you
want to stay as you want to stand their

66
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:09,850
ground so this is better with you want
to devote maybe some time apart from

67
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:17,400
your business and your family for the
country you are volunteer but especially

68
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,109
during free time

69
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:29,130
what we do we have our exercises
training and we fulfill our tasks at the

70
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:37,219
evenings of the working days and on the
weekends they compensate for the

71
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,210
specific dissipation of the thirty years
per day so it's like three days per

72
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,340
month I think everyone understands what
the situation is and I think everyone

73
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:57,690
can devote three days like let's say two
evenings of the working days and one

74
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:03,130
weekend a the security of their country

75
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,670
compensates assume that it's not a lot
just gas managed to have your lunch

76
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:20,410
yesterday arrested so have is too much
as a person

77
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:33,000
advise the battle have to thank you so
the difference between professional army

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,270
and national guard love letters that the
participation in the international

79
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:43,059
military missions as long as a
professional soldier as for nearly 22

80
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:47,829
years if the country since May somewhere
I have to go there national guardsmen

81
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:57,010
can choose who wants to participate are
now well the main point here is that

82
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,230
possibilities to build synergies among
royal that is different professions

83
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:08,620
using their knowledge and experience so
we will never be able to pay talented

84
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:18,200
people in cyber to to be a full time
army guys drinkin involve them we can

85
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,430
train them we can provide them
participation in a very interesting

86
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,900
military exercises as a civilian they
will never a good thing to do is but

87
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:39,490
I can assure you there are many
interesting things going on as well they

88
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,990
mention the main task will have two main
clients certainly civilian sector and

89
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,660
the National Armed Forces if something
happens in the civilian sector in

90
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,870
critical infrastructure somewhere that
the certainly team cannot deal with the

91
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,780
day run run out of the resources they
call us and say do you have this

92
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,150
expertise can you provide this month the
this much people for this this problem

93
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:11,760
or a whole structure is tailor-made and
fast-paced I don't have like structure

94
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,630
with the different sections and
responsibilities these are officers some

95
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,360
days are and CEOs noncommissioned
officers I have just a pool of the

96
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
people

97
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,230
experts have had some kind of the skills
and when the task is given a look at the

98
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:35,120
capability catalog and I see ok I need
this guy this guy's not available

99
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,240
because some kind of business in
Australia so you have to build this

100
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:47,230
force larger than you anticipated to
something will happen because with the

101
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,230
laundry force now not all the time

102
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,280
all the people are available if you if
you want most of the thefts you need the

103
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:04,870
team of five six guys lets you cannot
base all operation of the five or six

104
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,240
really talented guys maybe they're not
available at this time

105
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,260
you need ten times more maybe twenty
times more because these guys not

106
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:21,150
available this one as well this is the
little overview of how we created our

107
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:28,840
unit as you all probably know we woke up
in 2007 when

108
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:37,370
large DDoS attacks its estonia and let
her in the 2008 there were really really

109
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,800
good signs that state sponsored attack
attack

110
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,120
Georgia so we started to think about it
takes some time to work with the

111
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,190
decision makers to work with the
politicians to build up the positive

112
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:58,880
energy around the idea and only in 2012
we start with the formal situation

113
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:07,960
analysis in February 2013 Ministry of
Defence said yes the concept is good we

114
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,870
need we need this kind of units we need
to reserve and they formally announced

115
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,750
that this unit will be created and we
started looking for people actually have

116
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,500
to have my server god cards to the here
today

117
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:32,510
Alex on this is clear and Eric's
probably wondering around the key people

118
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:39,150
three or four key people who are opinion
leaders within a community you need to

119
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,569
explain them the concept that need to be
devoted to it they need to be patriotic

120
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:54,570
and I was lucky that I could find the
steam ok July 2013 paperwork a lot of

121
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,420
administrative issues within with army
of course but that's my problem not

122
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:06,459
theirs in February 2005 414 unit was
fully established personal equipment

123
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:12,350
sales approved we started purchases were
started training we started to to make

124
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:20,980
plans and all this nice stuff what the
Army does and in January 2015 actually

125
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,160
we are now almost fully equipped with
cover premises week of the place where

126
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,219
people can come at every day or every
night and work on the issues that have

127
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,560
been given to or they want to of course
there are some control element because

128
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,239
its military but

129
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,850
what I am trying all the time to do is
usually we don't have enough resources

130
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,290
to train or infantry for the infantry
tasks and this is what I'm saying all

131
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,260
the time for the charge to the Minister
of Defense we don't need to train these

132
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,800
guys to be infantry guys of course we
have some military military stuff going

133
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,000
on but they just have to know how to
defend themselves they will never work

134
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:16,339
as an infantry unit and fulfill some
that well with the side that we need a

135
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:22,910
small unit of 98 but actually the
interest for this unit is is really

136
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,199
really exploded and we are thinking that
we would need to increase this number of

137
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,830
the stuff role because the very
foundation of the National Guard

138
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:41,500
National Guard except everyone who can
lend our is willing to participate

139
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,020
of course there are some restrictions as
a military have to be in some kind of

140
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:55,649
physical shape I mean medically but
those are my requirements for the

141
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:01,399
National Guard had another harsh you you
you cannot have criminal record

142
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:07,079
don't go there does non-starter because
of course they are we all have skeletons

143
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,760
of course but don't don't start with the
people who are really talented between

144
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,660
the criminal record you will never see
under the because you will be dragged

145
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:24,640
into continuous problems and that this
will do discuss things all the all the

146
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,340
other project and yes well yes please

147
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:39,680
the question is about the selection of
the candidates and selection of the

148
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:47,089
volunteers with the former bosses I i'm
asking I'll just don't use going through

149
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:55,260
an account of the formal process to
identify would be able to maintain

150
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:01,200
difference security alerts a credential
levels or are they able to keep secret

151
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,810
information under control or something
ledges I was just about to tell you

152
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:13,630
about this as a as I started to say our
model we we we decided that everyone in

153
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:18,970
this unit needs security clearance
national and also EU and NATO security

154
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:27,640
clearance because the secret secret the
second one that made no secret EU

155
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:33,319
security and national security because
one thing is that in military exercises

156
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,630
its not that common but sometimes you
need this clearance and if you go to the

157
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:46,280
to the exercises its all stops there and
the other thing is when something really

158
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:54,949
bad happens will you really want to let
someone from the street to touch some

159
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,130
kind of the systems if they're not
checked of course something happens and

160
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,890
I don't know in poland minister of
defense comes to to to you and says you

161
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:11,540
have talent we need help and well
thousand people says we want to we want

162
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,550
to do that and and so on so on

163
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:20,740
you don't have time for the security
clearance checking in and everything is

164
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:31,590
just let the men and it could be even
worse and not doing anything so also we

165
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,679
are communicating with the public to the
media we are giving out information

166
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,460
about the exercises were you all the
information about what we are doing we

167
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:50,680
have one mean one point of contact email
the person who who who is interested he

168
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,720
writes i've heard about the unit I'm
interested can you tell me more about it

169
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,470
and then we start communicating we are
giving them all day

170
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:06,780
all the requirements how to join
National Guard what they what they have

171
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:15,500
to do what they shouldn't do the next
step is we are giving them to fill like

172
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,110
online questionnaire about the technical
skills recalled that declared

173
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,500
capabilities the person feels all the
online questionnaire really detailed

174
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,140
about what the what he can do what he
cannot do

175
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,659
ok the cloud capabilities next step is
we are trying them out in or internal

176
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:40,360
exercise we are seeing how they are
communicating with other team members

177
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,100
what they can contribute but that not
that that's necessarily mean that we

178
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,408
will push push them away if they are
like first year student of IIT no

179
00:18:52,409 --> 00:19:00,059
because when we are doing some tasks of
course a lot of the 30 workers as well

180
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:04,990
and they want to be with the guys who
are more experienced who don't want to

181
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:11,620
do that on their free time so I would
say our unit consists of the three

182
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,729
levels of the specialist the first level
specialist the first level as experts in

183
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:23,309
some kind of the field in some kind of
the problem what is going on those those

184
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:32,860
guys are like five or six percent their
second largest group I call them a good

185
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:39,020
system administrators they are somehow
involved with the security they're doing

186
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,668
some specific that they are trained to
do something but they want to learn more

187
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:49,840
and do more we don't give basic idea
knowledge we involve people who has

188
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:58,240
either formal education in I T or
practical and the third group is as I

189
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,840
already mentioned those guys who are
really eager to do something they are

190
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:09,110
students or they're able to devote a lot
of time to study

191
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:21,760
and those are working bees ok 0000 the
cover probably pretty much all of it

192
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:31,850
yea well one to three days it's not that
much but if you need two guys from some

193
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,659
important exercise your full-time guys
are not available

194
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,610
some kind of position has not filled
these guys come in if you need to do

195
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:48,209
something maybe not really priority one
order guys who are on in every day are

196
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:54,660
doing priority were they want second
opinion they give us incident though of

197
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,309
course there so they are sanitizing it
out of the older all the sensitive

198
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:05,780
information but they giving essence of
the incident and we are bringing

199
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,010
together a team we are looking into the
incident and we are giving them back to

200
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:17,799
the the report information I could tell
you we had the several of those and as

201
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,918
always comes out if there are second
opinion that there is a new findings

202
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:32,220
even for the pool for the really really
professional in town two days yes this

203
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:39,150
is the framework for training program or
training program is based on that

204
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:46,820
everyone in the unit needs basic
understanding and basic skill in every

205
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:53,639
aspect of eighty security basic
understanding but the goal is that in

206
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,780
one or two in these areas they are
looking forward to become experts but

207
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,910
they need a basic understanding of
everything else can work with other

208
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,490
experts they can

209
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:14,390
build the team because probably you know
that you know a world teamwork sometimes

210
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:25,240
is a problem because everyone has his
ways and I've seen several times that

211
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,870
five guys working on the same problem
from different angles and on don't

212
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:36,409
communicate military is good for this
because we are we are we are really

213
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:44,660
strong to to create something as a team
work and to communicate to come forward

214
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:55,910
and say I'm at this place and where are
you I'm song first year when we started

215
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,170
with thought that ok we will have a lot
of problems to organize or our own dance

216
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:09,150
or own exercises and so on but right now
in the nato in the European Union and in

217
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:15,429
other formats like will cover partner
state in the United States Michigan they

218
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:23,760
are they already have really really good
exercises and they they they bring so in

219
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,780
one year

220
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,320
who participated in the six major
exercises cyber Europe in technical and

221
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,360
operational parts and lock shields
really good exercise technical exercise

222
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,729
server endeavor United States lead the
led the exercise several coalition NATO

223
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:48,809
exercise the system paid this was sober
paintball with the Michigan guys

224
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:56,399
remotely a great great stuff

225
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,420
slowly going to the conclusion so
strengthening defense of the state of

226
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,580
society

227
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,870
well I see I see a lot of talent
probably some of you want to contribute

228
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,639
something but you just don't have the
platform you just don't have the

229
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,310
opportunity to contribute to the state
security and not interrupting

230
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,950
interrupting your everyday life your
business and your family this is a good

231
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,820
this is a good place to do that

232
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:34,669
yeah well we have our joint exercises
with the circle the mill circle the

233
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,960
other state institutions leslie has a
small country everybody knows everyone

234
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,170
and we can organize these exercises like
with the phone calls and that's that's

235
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:51,000
right we also participating organization
on national cyber exercise is led by

236
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:01,550
circle the mill cert and what what is
the what is good for the employers

237
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:08,560
because those guys who go to our unit
and have their experience they have

238
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,200
their networking with other guys they
have their experience in the military

239
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,790
exercises they're bringing back the
knowledge to the institutions and I've

240
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,470
been working a lot with the lawyers
without the big companies and smaller

241
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,760
companies and so on and so on and most
of them are really understanding and

242
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,260
even like saying to the other employees
maybe you want to join to this it's it's

243
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:39,290
beneficial so an enhancing security
level four level for all so on this is

244
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:44,500
actually the only point of contact if
you're interested right there at the

245
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:54,430
same email will answer as I said stand
your ground you're not going anywhere so

246
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:59,530
somebody in the wounded in the back of
their minds think something really bad

247
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:04,920
happens we'll bring my family to the
Sweden on somewhere and I'll be safe

248
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,480
never happens stand your ground

249
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:20,120
want to add something

250
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:32,669
you can follow us just to check what was
going on including that was the only

251
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:42,240
social media that the Minister of
Defense allow this supposed to accept of

252
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,610
questions for ya

253
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:55,199
my name is these are I am from a
sprained I was like two days ago and

254
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:03,370
presentation of cyber security unit of
the Ministry of Defense Advanced and it

255
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:08,969
was really terrible so that your
presentation prices and that's probably

256
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:15,860
because your country was like
experiences ass pressure from other

257
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,240
countries

258
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:26,860
talks and what is interesting for me to
have cyber security unit is reported to

259
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:37,149
have like attacking defense a break
breakers and defenders you have my my my

260
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:43,160
my sword so if you have we already
experience in European Ukraine is that

261
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:50,870
like special cyber security units from
other countries hockey like our

262
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,919
ministries as well as Minister of the
fans and

263
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:03,030
if you have any idea staff in all
ministries of defense as well as you're

264
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:11,980
not able to like courage to track to
identify these are talks because very

265
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,080
often people

266
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,149
employees of this ministers trees they
are not from iraqis security I T

267
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:24,560
administrators are not former oh how to
perform investigation or even do not

268
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:31,159
monitor or even know log files no
Application Server databases activities

269
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:38,520
and so on so it's very important to like
health centralized IT program like

270
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:46,290
security assurance program to collect
all these like activities from all your

271
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:52,000
like ministries for your journeys into
one central place otherwise behavior

272
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,350
anomalies activities and so on and enjoy
cybersecurity holy 44 person who is

273
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:06,560
full-time employees are they all of them
oppose like focuses on analyzing walks

274
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,830
on analyzing behavior activities
tracking if you are ministries are

275
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,230
hawked or no so it's important to have
this

276
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:23,260
security key information management
system in place so do you use Sun's ok

277
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,240
maybe I was not clear enough

278
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,380
seven defense unit is the force provider
we don't have everyday tasks for those

279
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,950
are all those other institutions the
server picture of the ministries and so

280
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,760
on and so on

281
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,660
responsibility of the circle the we are
coming in only on the invitational basis

282
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,880
when some institution has reached their
limits they don't have enough expertise

283
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,630
they don't have to have enough personnel
so that that's where to the command of

284
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:02,179
chain they are asking us to come in so
those four full-time hours they actually

285
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:11,460
administered of people technical people
are part-timers ok do have some bug

286
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:18,360
bounty program for detecting some
critical vulnerabilities in your

287
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,479
ministry of defence infrastructure or
something with all this we are not

288
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,830
responsible for the administration of
the minister of defense or or any

289
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:33,110
institution we are we are we are
reserved

290
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,229
we are coming in with something really
bad happens and so when someone's

291
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:48,530
someone says I'm drowning I'm done I
need help

292
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:55,100
i'm david consultant for Industrial
Security have a bit of a provocative

293
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:01,949
questions are you not in some way to get
resources and maybe more motivation away

294
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,240
from the private sector because when I
think of somebody rain power plans or

295
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,860
provide over crudely sectors where
they're not say we don't have to train

296
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,110
our people too much we don't have to
build up Iran team if something really

297
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,389
bad happens we can always call the
National Guard

298
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:26,740
well not really well it seemed this
presentation made seemed overly

299
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:34,340
optimistic probably for you because we
are not like corrupting the free market

300
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,870
we are not going we're not offering or

301
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:42,939
services for the institutions and the
private sector will say well we'll do

302
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,040
the prep penetration test for you or
something like that

303
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,170
the there is a certain things

304
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:58,000
laid out in the legislature in what
cases we are going in when we are

305
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:13,760
invited only minor question do you have
to be to join forces

306
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:26,670
ok because I know there was a large
population of people in the possibility

307
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:33,300
to go and let them see if they didn't
get it they don't want it really really

308
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:39,340
kind of way to do that and still want to
do that so they don't want to be elected

309
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,059
citizen it's not that hard

310
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:49,299
hello my name is Thomas did you

311
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:56,059
any problems during security clearance
for the UN jet rejects some people

312
00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:00,389
because of the security clearance away
are now in the process because you know

313
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:05,309
the wiring of the security clearances a
long process and see a National Security

314
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:10,739
Agency and all those institutions they
take a lot of time to do that up until

315
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:17,239
now we didn't have any problems but I
think this is a success because in the

316
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:23,580
process of admission to the unit we are
really detailed the in detail explain

317
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,408
people what would be those cases when
they they cannot obtain a security

318
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:35,789
clearance so up until now we are real
good I foresee that there will be some

319
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:41,200
kind of the problem because because
there always is but still in the other

320
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,720
units of the National Guard we are the
only unit of the National Guard need

321
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,320
security clearance

322
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:53,100
you cannot join all units may be
enjoying I don't know engineer engineer

323
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,259
battalion artillery battalion or
something they don't need security

324
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:07,039
clearances if you want to devote some
time to say security and I'm sure I work

325
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,918
with UBS question is in case of a
wartime scenario would you need an

326
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:19,719
invitation to join or do you do it
voluntarily very well actually the more

327
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:25,609
provocative question that you and yours
because as we all talked about the same

328
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:30,250
security clearances of course all the
wartime plans are classified they are

329
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:36,690
plans in place what we do and how we do
it but unfortunately I cannot discuss it

330
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,119
with you

331
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:43,359
wartime plans I meant when you're
attacked not necessarily attacking

332
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,759
someone

333
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,250
said they don't agree with their are
alike

334
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,399
defenders and attackers defenders on it
that covers everyone is attacker because

335
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,049
if you if you want to defend something
you have to be at that so that is that

336
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,590
sir

337
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:09,160
official position of the Latin country
is that we have a separate unit defense

338
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,470
there are no planning documents or
anything laid out in the legislature

339
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:23,810
that would say that we could look at the
scenario that we are taxed someone this

340
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:29,970
is open and search for imagination
probably mean defense is the best form

341
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,779
of attack

342
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,040
offense is the best form of defence
that's that sort of a strategy if you

343
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,480
are threatened

344
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:45,440
military also there's defense there's
active defense there's a fence and

345
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:54,490
people politicians can play with those
terms but i would i would say in the

346
00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:02,830
cyber more so than in the classical
military the attackers are in really

347
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:12,040
good place resources wise and any other
in the classical military you know there

348
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,480
is a company in defense you need three
times more troops to attack them three

349
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,520
times more resources and so by the by
the book and you can hope that the

350
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,940
attack will succeed in cyber attack
defenses defenses expensive I hope

351
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,930
nothing happens

352
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:41,859
thank you that we are here the terence
group and the first question is do you

353
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:50,710
think that's willing to use makes prices
and wages risk with people for instance

354
00:36:50,710 --> 00:37:04,470
can take of do 40 minutes instead of the
tasks as the audience would have

355
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:16,220
security credentials above just sooo
just measure if this kind of this kind

356
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:23,520
of initiative is possible involvement
with Indus just kind of people with the

357
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,119
side of the platform of the National
Guard was the best one for us in every

358
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,900
way as i understand or know National
Guard and Interpol and it's it's it's

359
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,450
not a question about the platform it's a
question about how to attractive and

360
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:43,640
possibly easy way to bring people into
developed something security I don't

361
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,020
have the ready answer for for for the
polling situation but

362
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,980
think the discussions are going on and
you'll find some sites some way how to

363
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:59,680
involve those people and to answer your
first question of course we didn't

364
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:12,970
tested with something happens but the
stuff already ok we don't see that in

365
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:21,490
the Baltic sending the ball and will be
some kind of the overall from war this

366
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:30,509
will be some kind of the rolling rolling
if it happens I hope not crawling in

367
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:36,490
saddam's incidents coming in incidents
going all out and so on and so on and as

368
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:41,439
I like to say the cyber is like modern
artillery more than a military injury in

369
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,050
Georgia as well

370
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:48,700
well before the before the troops than
10 over cyberattacks like preparing the

371
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:54,490
ground they like preparing their minds
and so on I don't see i don't see the

372
00:38:54,490 --> 00:39:01,419
the situation where someone from my unit
but actually they understand the risks

373
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:07,130
also some of my unit would say that I
need to run somewhere because actually

374
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:12,430
when we are doing more tests available I
don't need them become classical

375
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,839
military don't need them to come in in
the in the unit they just need to answer

376
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:29,740
I can do something so he can sit in
Australian do something

377
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:39,759
decoration the first one is what we
understand becoming a member of the

378
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,740
organization is a voluntary basis

379
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:48,069
always yeah this is the stepping down
from the position of the member of

380
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:56,520
voluntary basis for the legislature for
the for the sake of the lawyers

381
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:03,080
signing the contract for five years but
stepping down from the position of the

382
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,430
National Guardsmen on the judicial side
is very easy to just try to reports the

383
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:12,140
commander of the National Guard I have
to leave the National Guard reasons for

384
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:18,720
this and that and if he wants to chill
and the second question is do cover with

385
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,779
your initiative only ICT security
technical aspects or maybe other ones

386
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,910
likely go or if not are there any plans
regard really good question actually the

387
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,899
plan their own concept was to just to
collect just bring together

388
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,540
technical guys but really followed
literally fast we understood that we

389
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,690
need also lawyers will also need the
media specialists we also need the

390
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:52,080
social engineer specialists who are not
always necessary technical guys in OCT

391
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:57,740
so these these three professions are
crucial because you never exercised in

392
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:04,970
every task they are always questions
about the jurisdiction as American

393
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:10,480
counterparts always say all the
technical capabilities these are only 20

394
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,950
percent of the problem

395
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,299
eighty percent of the problem what we
can do but we cannot do in the manner

396
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,300
that nobody on the team gets her
afterwards I mean like put in jail for

397
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:27,540
something so so yes lawyers media
specialist

398
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,990
we already have those who already have
those couple of those guys we are well

399
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:38,399
that wasn't the day initial plan but we
really really fast understood that we

400
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:48,330
need we need them

401
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:57,090
solution of some incident and if so
could you give us maybe some basic

402
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:06,360
statistics and examples ok last year we
started to work with the circle as

403
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:14,570
already mentioned they are sanitizing
the real real incidents sanitizing

404
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,300
meaning bringing old all the commercial
information sensitive information

405
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:24,190
because the relationship between this
certainly is industry an industry is

406
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:29,800
based on mutual trust industry relies on
the certainly today will not disclose

407
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:36,400
some kinds of their secret so they are
sanitizing the incidents and giving them

408
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:46,960
to us not really I think I love to talk
about the numbers but more than last

409
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:55,290
year more than let let's say it's it's a
two digit number

410
00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:08,440
with minor stomach exercises and this
introductory training to provide and

411
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:20,120
other advanced trainings for people to
or yes we are using all kinds of

412
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:25,990
opportunities in the military to send
them to the different courses with on

413
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,509
send them to the expense of civilian
courses because military cannot pay for

414
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,790
that we are sending to the them to the
military courses they're participating

415
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:39,080
in the exercises and also what we are
doing what we discovered actually not

416
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,880
discovered but we were taking this from
the stone and guys that within the unit

417
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,240
when you have your core there are so
many specialists that you can have a lot

418
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:55,930
of training a lot of lectures within
within your unit so everyone on the unit

419
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:03,609
is obliged to give at least 14 hour
training election year if you're not

420
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:09,000
feeling really good at something you
have one year to study something we're

421
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,350
not like really enforcing this but this
is the year old enough for them so

422
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,339
you're joining the unit you need to
provide also some kind of training for

423
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:22,800
other guys on the team so we using
internal services and only then we also

424
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,300
source of course we all sources well the
people for industry are interested to

425
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,280
come in and give some some kind of
training of lectures we are requesting

426
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,610
them with some some some military things
you know a lot of small of information

427
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:45,370
warfare of psychological operations
intelligence operations I don't know

428
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:50,650
development of the robotics someone
someone special extended this one well

429
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,070
let's bring him in and discuss how this
would influence the security in the

430
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,690
future

431
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:00,970
question we know that there are such
units in the United States in Great

432
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,288
Britain in Japan

433
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:10,699
tanya is there any form of exchange of
your experiences or we don't have any

434
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:16,439
ties with Japan we really really close
relationship with their Stoneham seven

435
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:20,739
defense you have a close relationship
with the mission and national guard sub

436
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:31,249
components both on there and Delancey
well we have on the information exchange

437
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:39,118
level with the Lithuanians information
exchange level with the Germany which

438
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:47,189
started to be involved in some kind of
like see if we can do something with

439
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:55,009
ukraine well and now we're here so
because last two years

440
00:45:55,009 --> 00:46:01,910
exercise locked shields Poland was
always a bolus so here are some really

441
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:03,029
talented

442
00:46:03,029 --> 00:46:09,799
yeah well thank you for that

443
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:15,489
Latvia Baltics and Poland therefore they
face the same regional threats and not

444
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:20,539
always always the same things on the
technical but but their agenda agenda

445
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:26,469
will probably will be the same thought
process of decision makers the

446
00:46:26,469 --> 00:46:31,569
operational level how this is spread out
to the technical guys so I think this is

447
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:35,419
a good opportunity for four baltics in
poland to work together on this because

448
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:40,179
the pole in this huge regional country
you have a lot of people a lot of talent

449
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:45,259
so maybe we can we can share something
and we can give something back to you as

450
00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:52,730
well I would like to ask about

451
00:46:52,730 --> 00:47:03,660
is there any public least you're now so
it's well it's not it's not a secret

452
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,580
unit

453
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:10,840
let's say it's not a secret unit but we
have the policy everyone who don't want

454
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:16,590
to be recognized in media or somewhere
we respect that and for the other

455
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:21,110
members of the team is prohibited to
rule to release the identities of the

456
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:32,950
other members being in the group is
beneficial for their employees employers

457
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,129
so do provide any signed certificate or
something like that

458
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:42,250
their current employees working for you

459
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:49,670
well as I said we don't like they don't
cover their identities but you know

460
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:53,390
covering the identity never works

461
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:58,950
work something that we as a group come
together and we decided okay we will not

462
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:05,939
release decent you will not believe that
if someone says I work for the employer

463
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:13,240
because a lot of business in the east
and I don't really want that information

464
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:22,140
that I mean the unit to be in any way to
the employer someone else we are doing

465
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,240
everything in our power to not to do
that but we have we're explaining them

466
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:32,379
that there there is there is a name name
tag this is not the security on it this

467
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,100
is not like special forces or something
so there is a risk so they have to

468
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:50,930
evaluate this and decide if they're
willing to take that risk around

469
00:48:50,930 --> 00:49:02,270
regarding the people

470
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,860
sounds so special way

471
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:18,080
special situations so for example crisis
time scamming and there is new to the

472
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,569
group growed esteem for example to I
know call eighty percent of them to to

473
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:30,200
do something they need can count on some
special protection during this time for

474
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,980
example here we are again we are going
into class but stuff a little bit but

475
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:42,680
just before the thought this kind of
unit as military says its high-value

476
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:48,450
target and a certain situation it is it
is protected as a high-value target

477
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:55,859
because there is a country units but
there's only so much people who can do

478
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:05,580
this stuff that's all I need to know

479
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:17,770
of you all these challenging to find a
guy who is able to go through their

480
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:24,680
creations former procedural or to find
again and export because I i think is

481
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,169
validation your country might be
complicated because I believe that

482
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:35,250
majority of companies businesses with
Wordle it's a distant countries we have

483
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:40,300
an experienced problem let me over that
we have people who work with the Eastern

484
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:44,540
countries and there they have liked to
business trips every month and so on and

485
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:53,980
so on but I would say a special and
appalled and especially into poland you

486
00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:01,220
need people you don't need to bring
these guys really good but well he has

487
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:08,160
some problems but we need him to undo
that the first thing is better and

488
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:14,980
clearer clear record don't go into the
area that are putting someone in the

489
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:20,660
basement and let's say you don't go to
jail and and go go go do that this is

490
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:27,109
not the voluntary voluntary organisation
and is not for that I don't know what

491
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:39,650
the security agencies though do I have
no comment

492
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:49,540
I have a question about a law the law
regulations Lowell special permissions

493
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:59,860
to to work with with your team or not in
low of the National Guard their ten main

494
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:07,300
tasks and one of the tasks which gives
up alternative is to support to resolve

495
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:13,000
or mitigate incidents in the cyberspace
to support circle the international

496
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,270
forces coming from from this level of
the law level there are other

497
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:26,759
regulations and manuals and standing
operational procedures to come from that

498
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:33,390
yes we have managed to destroy the
parliament and we have this regulation

499
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:41,859
or law because as i understand you are
also some monies or only try to select

500
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:48,680
only through the certainly because
private company of something what they

501
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,899
do is critical they are in trouble

502
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:58,080
first I go to the circle if certainly is
not able to help them they need more

503
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:03,670
resources and this is a critical thing I
want to I want to be clear we are not

504
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:09,650
trying to go and help every private
company with the administration now we

505
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:14,560
are talking about the stuff that is
critical for the existence of the

506
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:20,590
country so they go to the circle of a
they evaluate things if they're not able

507
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:25,280
to help they can call us

508
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:34,990
volunteer for you that they can even the
worst because of because they have some

509
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:45,879
special access to two critical yeah well
this is the basis of mutual trust I

510
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:51,770
don't see the scenario that bank would
ask for help for example the the

511
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,380
institution of banking they will they
will never release this information of

512
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,510
course and the bank bank banks if they
are major banks they are critical

513
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:07,540
infrastructure so this is a challenge
but I believe until the last moment will

514
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:28,100
try to find the resources and weighs
call to do to it for themselves

515
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:50,940
bank's ability to have heat electricity
we are just like a force provider when

516
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:56,859
everything everything else which is
built for everyday situation fails we

517
00:54:56,859 --> 00:55:06,360
are just preparing for the like hope for
the best prepare for the worst

518
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:15,340
yes the owners of the critical
infrastructure there's a list of them

519
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:23,860
and they are managed by the National
Security Authority in conjunction with

520
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:29,960
the circle the but I don't know why
because it's obvious which is critical

521
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,650
infrastructure or not but in Latvia list
of the critical infrastructure is also

522
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:47,400
plus that doesn't make doesn't make very
little sense but but they did that

523
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:58,770
yes

524
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:04,950
high reward for HP security analyst
basically the requirement of having a

525
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:07,970
clear record aren't you afraid that that
deficits will attack your critical

526
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:14,220
infrastructure without without this
requirement will be just better

527
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,680
technical specialist than those who will
have a clear record who work for you

528
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,669
already defending is like more
complicated than attacking so far do you

529
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,890
have any thoughts on this

530
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:29,950
well this this and I'm not saying this
is a restriction this can be restriction

531
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:38,790
but all the other things which comes
with not clear record is a huge huge

532
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:45,330
problem to involve people in the
protection of the state this there is no

533
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:52,480
way to resolve that this is my opinion
because this this can't be true maybe

534
00:56:52,480 --> 00:57:08,349
now this is a restriction for unit

535
00:57:08,349 --> 00:57:15,859
ok I think he's probably the longest
question and answer session I ever heard

536
00:57:15,859 --> 00:57:27,828
once more it suits their interests of
the time I see so what was more tomorrow

537
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:31,420
before the lands with gas discussion

538
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:37,140
we've got pummeled least investigated
concept and present some ideas for

539
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,660
concept of how to do it

540
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:46,720
important if it is such an interest and
of course all this questions and great

541
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,109
presentation will help us to to

542
00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:55,788
have some ideas about our case so thank
you very much to to get for this

543
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:56,160
presentation
