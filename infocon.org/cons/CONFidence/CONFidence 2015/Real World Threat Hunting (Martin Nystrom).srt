1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
so few months ago my team detected the
activity of the kid are as malware and

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,928
you may be familiar with Kate hours it's
an evolution of Zeus tune in for Steeler

3
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:19,430
it's a really cool piece of malware
because what it does is it compromises

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:26,000
the victim's computer and once it
compromises it it waits to go to

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,860
Facebook and then does a web inject on
Facebook and invites you to download an

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,079
app that complements the Trojan and the
app is installed on your Android phone

7
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,079
and it gives you instructions for
overriding the security warnings of that

8
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,969
and then it what it does is it
intercepts the two-factor authentication

9
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:52,879
used by banks so that I can log in as
you and steal your money so my team

10
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,680
conducts security monitoring for
customers and we saw this a few months

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,960
ago for one of our large Canadian
financials this malware by the way it

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,460
specifically targets banks in specific
regions so the Netherlands India canada

13
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,830
is one of them and we happen to have a
customer in Canada who's a large

14
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,658
financial so we gave this a lot of
scrutiny and we looked at it we saw that

15
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,979
within just a few minutes this was
something of alarm to us so when we

16
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,259
investigated it these are the steps we
went through this is what investigators

17
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,689
some of you may be security
investigators the user what our security

18
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:37,460
investigators do as soon as our analysts
saw this attack she raised this to an

19
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,860
investigator for deeper investigation
the investigator made sure we saw a call

20
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:47,610
back and NetFlow is a key tool that we
use we love now flow because we don't

21
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,170
have to worry about the payload we can
see the traffic moving around and you

22
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,960
can see the call back at one-minute
intervals which if your security

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,189
investigator you know that's typical bot
activity so we see botnet activity

24
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,229
coming we also see that the IOC is
matching meaning this IP address for

25
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:09,030
some period of time is considered
malicious and the attacker was smart

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,220
enough to actually Trojan a machine at
st. Mary's University in

27
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,220
Canada which would then lower the
defenses of anyone monitoring that

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,490
network and we found that this was
targeted in the sense that we didn't see

29
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:32,490
any of our other customers being hit by
the same malware so I'm a manager I'm

30
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,190
not a hacker and all I want to tell you
in just a few minutes why I'm really

31
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,340
here why I'm in Cracow but I'm gonna
wait till the end and what I want to

32
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,820
walk you through today are are just the
way we see the world we run a group I

33
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,040
actually came from I was investigator
for years I started to security

34
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,019
monitoring team I wrote a work based on
that based on what I've learned doing

35
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,250
security monitoring just for inside of
Cisco and we turn that into a service

36
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,160
offered to customers and the reason we
did that as we can see that the world is

37
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,810
changing in the customers need something
better

38
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,640
the threats are changing for example
everyone brings their own device to work

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,570
now and then most companies they can
show up with their own Android phone

40
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:24,000
iPhone iPad their own custom-built
Windows laptop or Mac like my Mac people

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,820
are using social media all day and we
know that attackers are leveraging

42
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:36,260
social media to enable them to to stalk
their prey and to ultimately succeed to

43
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,299
to convince them to install that malware
we also know that there's a ton of cloud

44
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,230
services which makes it really hard to
know what is malicious network traffic

45
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,570
and what's benign and the app stores
some app stores are better at curating

46
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,970
their content than others

47
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,019
we also know that threats are changing
so for example if you did anyone hear

48
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,850
read the Verizon data breach
investigations report now Verizon's kind

49
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,209
of a competitor for me but I love that
report that report is full of great

50
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,930
information about how attacks are
working and which ones are not working

51
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,519
and one of the things that they
highlight is that the attacker is

52
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,100
usually successful within just a few
hours 60% of the time it only takes

53
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,590
minutes or hours for the attack to
succeed and begin actual trading

54
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:35,419
information but most defenders it takes
them months and usually that means law

55
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,850
enforcement tapped him on the shoulder
or assert organization and says we found

56
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:46,630
evidence that your system is compromised
we we know also that point of sale

57
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,510
malware which is something at least in
the USA that's been hitting us hard

58
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,760
target Home Depot have been hit very
hard by point of sale mauer is

59
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:01,219
extraordinarily successful and companies
are losing millions of dollars now in my

60
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,280
years of experience and I've been in
security now for thirteen years so I've

61
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,090
been at this for a while back in the
2000 sort of the good old days

62
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,619
attackers were mostly there to annoy you
right there you Trojans were disrupted

63
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,810
they created a lot of network noise
fairly easy to see on the network but if

64
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,770
you remember things like Code Red and
slammer really disruptive they've just

65
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,349
blast through your network but in the
mid 2000 the attackers got really good

66
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,330
next on the way to make money at this
and an entire ecosystem was developed

67
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,159
that allow them to trade Trojans and
skills for money and we now find

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,750
ourselves in a place where attacks are
migrating not just to make money

69
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,440
cybercrime is real and it's a large part
of what we see but we also see that

70
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,600
attackers are going after corporate data
and I'll show you an example in just a

71
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,170
few minutes of one of the attacks that
we've observed that we know was

72
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,220
purposely trying to steal corporate data
from a customer so we know the corporate

73
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,840
data is on the menu for attackers and
they're they're doing getting better and

74
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,979
better but all this time our ability to
see through this and find a loss is

75
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,750
getting harder and harder why in the old
days IRC was just you know that's how c2

76
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,010
happened it was just IRC all you do is
block IIR seaports and you're relatively

77
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,330
safe and then they totaled it and then
the encrypted it and now they use social

78
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,859
media and cloud storage to move stuff
around and we now see attacks using

79
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,249
Pinterest and YouTube comments for c2

80
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:39,889
so that encrypted traffic how do you
know that it's malicious if someone's

81
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:46,639
going to Pinterest and YouTube versus
some crazy looking DGA it's very against

82
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,979
getting harder and harder for the
defender so the group that I ron is

83
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:58,869
called Cisco active threat analytics 88
that's our guy design a logo for us and

84
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:02,429
I like it because it's a bunch of binary
and we can find a tax sitting there in

85
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:08,938
the middle and what we really aim to do
is to use for things to solve the

86
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:15,599
problem if we start with people we hire
great people we hire investigators that

87
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,360
have at least 10 years of experience
doing security investigations they know

88
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,259
their stuff because you can't just point
tools at this problem and win you gotta

89
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,659
have good people

90
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,519
second we apply analytics and the reason
we apply analytics as does what I just

91
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:36,779
said on the last slide we're getting
blind the payloads are encrypted the the

92
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,739
attackers are using social media to move
date around you've gotta have analytics

93
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:45,299
to spot the militias from the benign we
use security intelligence security

94
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:49,349
intelligence is probably 80% of the
winds we get today is through

95
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:54,329
intelligence just very quickly be able
to see data and zoom in on it and then

96
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:59,549
lastly we've built a new platform called
open sock and I'm gonna show it to you

97
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,638
in just a few minutes

98
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,099
open site allows us to apply big data
which you here way too many times you're

99
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,979
sick of hearing the term I now but we
use Hadoop and a bunch of Apache

100
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:16,058
projects to handle massive amounts of
data six gig per second or more and

101
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:21,729
actually find attacks in the data so
this is that these are the four pillars

102
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:26,079
of our solution and in just a couple
minutes I'm gonna go through and kinda

103
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,409
talk to you about how this works for us
now one of the things we've heard from

104
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:35,599
customers is that they don't want their
data to leave their network so we put

105
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,050
this big stack of gear and it's all
Cisco stuff but as running open source

106
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,558
software plus our own we own Sourcefire
now the smart guys beyond that we put it

107
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:46,750
in their threat Britta sandbox would put
that in there too

108
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,200
we put it on a customer network we don't
move data in route now big surprise

109
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,460
customers in Europe are not interested
in having their data leave their

110
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,070
datacenter and come back through the you
s why because of what they've learned

111
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,660
from Edwards note so customers want
their data sitting on their data center

112
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,270
they also want staff from near that at
least in or near their country to be

113
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,890
analyzing and I'll tell you more about
that in a bit but we use a secure VPN

114
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,890
link to analyze the data and then we
have tools that allow us to move around

115
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,660
within our case systems and then
ultimately brief a customer securely

116
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,579
about the attack now one of the cool
things about the solution is that not

117
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,990
only we starving all the data off the
wire but we're also indexing it all so

118
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,050
we build network meditate on top of that
which means we get full packet capture +

119
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,819
metadata indexing across all of the
payload right because as you know the

120
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,780
headers of those IP packets are super
interesting but we also take machine

121
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,730
exhaust means we take your syslog will
log into databases and script the data

122
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,850
out we know how to pull data from
anywhere in the network and stuff it in

123
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:02,280
this big system and analyze it and find
threats that's what we're doing now open

124
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,530
socket particular which runs on a
platform there's two key things it does

125
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:10,120
the first is that it reaches the data
and that means if you're an analyst and

126
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,420
your job is to make the donuts every day
which means you're there monitoring the

127
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,400
network looking for threats we enrich
the data with what we know about the

128
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,459
victim where did this happen on the
victims at work what IP address range

129
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,240
because there's a big difference between
the guest wireless and the data center

130
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,430
where the Oracle server is huge
difference right so we mark up the data

131
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,680
we enrich it we add at about
vulnerabilities of the victim what we

132
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,900
know about intelligence of the attacker
itself and then the second thing we do

133
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,459
is we apply analytics to it we conduct
predictive modeling we've taken we've

134
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,270
actually partnered with a company that
does banking fraud and we've taken those

135
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:54,579
those algorithms and we've applied them
into this so we can discover new DA's we

136
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,510
can discover new means of exploration
that we had no one has seen before

137
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:04,890
or by applying it right there on our
platform this platform if we zoom into

138
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,699
it

139
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,930
here's what it looks like and after the
talk if you want to go into detail about

140
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,560
how this works

141
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,219
talk to gobble he's the technical guy I
i'm not technical enough to give you a

142
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,830
fully detailed breakdown but I can get
you in touch with the people that can

143
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,890
here's how it works

144
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,590
the first thing we do is up at the top
left we just put in a passive tap so

145
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,100
this solution is passive we don't see if
it breaks when I get to bring down the

146
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,920
network we pulling everything we can
offer network not only by starving data

147
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,370
off the wire but also any of the network
telemetry or or or machine exhaust on

148
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,110
there and effectively if you look at
these Apache projects like flume and

149
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,420
Kafka and storm these are just Apache
projects their tools that allow us to

150
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,130
handle massive amounts of data set up
topics to prioritize how we process the

151
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:03,630
data and smooth it through the system so
its real-time processing storage we

152
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,010
actually use high for storage so that
means we can when we find an attack we

153
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:13,510
can index the packet associated to that
attack go back in fine and analyze it so

154
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,100
the investigator actually has a
recording of the full packet capture

155
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,320
wooden goes to analyze the attack

156
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:28,890
huge huge advantage to his analysis you
can go to get up and get yourself and if

157
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,650
you now we're not going to help you with
Hadoop we're not gonna bring

158
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,939
investigative skills we won't give you
our playbook but you can use that

159
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,550
platform yourself and running on big
iron big hardware and can do this kind

160
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:47,990
of thing on your own by downloading get
up by downloading open sock downtown you

161
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,340
don't have enough room to delegate up
now the intelligence sort of the secret

162
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,580
sauce inside of the system is because
Cisco is in a really privileged position

163
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:04,590
in the world we are on and most of the
world's network and that means we can

164
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:11,730
see things that no one else can see for
example we say we see a third of the

165
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,850
world's email traffic

166
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,300
because it traverses our hardware our
routers switches email security

167
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:22,160
appliances we actually see all that all
that traffic and if you add up all the

168
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,279
web requests we see with our cloud
security with the WSA the web security

169
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:33,329
appliance as well as our cloud solutions
for for web security we see thirteen

170
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:39,329
billion web requests every day so we put
all that in the system in addition to

171
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,430
the connections we have with the DNS
roots the ISP gateways government

172
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,050
intelligence open source intelligence
you put all that together we have a

173
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,540
superior position we have information
superiority that means we can spot

174
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:58,790
threats in a massive system that others
can see and so we use that responsibly

175
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,439
by deploying that not only to our
products and platforms but also into our

176
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,079
services so we can help customers with
this he can't really buy this

177
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:13,250
intelligence you have to buy it through
our services and products so the last

178
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,399
thing I'd like to highlight about the
solution and i wanna give you a couple

179
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:28,529
of case studies what I call exemplars
this map is the DGA for crypto locker so

180
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:33,860
DGAF most of you probably know but just
bear with me a demand generated

181
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,399
algorithm which means that attackers are
smart enough now that they don't bother

182
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,589
using just an IP address for command
control casual stomp on it then they

183
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:48,029
used a fast flux to register a DNS
against tons of IP's and then you had to

184
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:52,790
block the DNS name now they're smart
enough that they register a DGA and the

185
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,189
malware with an algorithm that allows
them to to switch up the DNS that

186
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:01,800
they're connected to over and again so
fast that you can never blocked the

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,569
actual attacks anymore so we have to get
smarter one of the ways we get smarter

188
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:12,310
is by discovering the DGA we can then
use that to prioritize our detection and

189
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,589
some of our prevention by blocking it so
we use predictive analytics we use what

190
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,819
we've learned from the cognitive
acquisition and Prague to apply data

191
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:26,290
scientists on all this data and finally
attacks that's one of the advantages

192
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:32,939
as we bring to the solution so my
favorite thing to talk about other real

193
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,860
cases the things we've seen so that's
all do before I go into them now I'll

194
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,319
just tell you over the past few months
that I've been on this team here are

195
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,790
some of the things we've seen that I
think are indicative of where the market

196
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,230
is going for attacks and I wonder if
these resonate with you if they do you

197
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,980
know maybe let's grab a coffee or a beer
and we can talk about them but here's

198
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,730
what I think we're seeing over the past
10 years in fact my executives come to

199
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,699
me the VP comes to me and says hey tell
me what kind of attack for saying so I

200
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:08,149
can brief this to customers and he says
how our tax change and I said well the

201
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,170
attacks really haven't changed that much
in the last 10 years it's still the

202
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,740
users who are the victims and they're
getting breached malware is really still

203
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,649
where most of the attacks occur most of
the time but what's changes in the old

204
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,300
days it used to be your operating system
that was vulnerable and compromised in

205
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,779
these days its plugins / Java
Silverlight that's how the attacks are

206
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:36,420
typically succeeding today we're also
seeing malware is sandboxes became a big

207
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,319
thing about three or four years ago now
we're getting smarter in knows how to

208
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,490
evade it knows how to detect that it's a
sandbox and then just evaded we're also

209
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:51,860
seeing tour which used to be used for
privacy protection tour is now being

210
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,620
used for malware exfiltration and
commanding control or seen that more and

211
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:03,040
more used more commonly we're seeing
Zeus is kind of on the on the outs Droid

212
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,030
X is taking its place to Zeus is is on
its way out or maybe times way out but

213
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,389
they're not making the money they used
to

214
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,919
we're seeing attackers getting better
top the station the way they named files

215
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,900
and move things around the house is
kinda began that because the attacker

216
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,990
was smart enough he could hide the
malware in the user profile instead of

217
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,230
the system32 but attackers are getting
smarter at the way they named things and

218
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,280
move things around and hide them in a
name processes and that that they're

219
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,980
just up the station is getting really
clever and then lastly is anyone has

220
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,950
anyone been insecurity long enough to
remember macros

221
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,060
as a way of delivering an exploit like
exploding someone via an office macro

222
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:48,800
that is so old school but it's happening
again that's the way attacks are getting

223
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,740
through again because users every user
will say yes to enable macros and the

224
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,880
attackers are just changing the stages
of the attack so that it reaches out to

225
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,930
pastebin get some code and goes out to
Dropbox to get the real code and and

226
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,810
it's it's all happening all over again
so attackers are smart enough to keep us

227
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:10,879
on our toes now remember most attacks
follow a kill chain at least typical

228
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,430
malware attacks follow a kill chain the
first thing you do is you you figure out

229
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,320
who you want to attack via social media
right so I know I want to get into Cisco

230
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,770
so let me see if I can find the the
Windows domain administrators and I'll

231
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,590
do that by looking for people in a
nightie role at Cisco on LinkedIn

232
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,949
pretty pretty common they'll in lower
than was some kind of a bit like a

233
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,960
resume making you look this over an
invitation to something and it also

234
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,380
follows we all know most of you are
probably all of you know the kill chain

235
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,130
but the goal is that we want to help as
a defender we want to move to the left

236
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:50,640
side of this and our detection right I
was just talking to someone who has a

237
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,980
company that's there to monitor social
media and cloud storage to find

238
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,850
indications of attack to help customers
find those attacks earlier in the kill

239
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,020
chain they would find them say the Recon
level that's the goal as as defenders we

240
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:11,270
need to move ourselves to the left so
let me give you a couple examples

241
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,970
here's our first example case 10 11 from
my team and this was some sandbox

242
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,150
evading malware that was targeted at
corporate users so let's walk through

243
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:25,770
the attack on the way to attack works
this is the Chanate or malware now first

244
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:32,930
of all the attackers were smart enough
to compromise WordPress servers to host

245
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:41,149
the exploit now why is that important
it's important because it

246
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:45,728
it lowers your defenses when you see a
name that doesn't look like a DGA so

247
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:50,089
that you click on it and install the
software from it so the attackers

248
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:55,509
exploited WordPress then they fished
corporate users with this really well

249
00:19:55,509 --> 00:20:00,649
written volume license email asking you
to register your your Microsoft Volume

250
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:05,080
License Agreement the user clicked it
they were redirected to a clever site

251
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,389
that hit the malware of using some nice
really well-written JavaScript the

252
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:15,748
Trojan was executed it actually hit
itself it did some clever things then it

253
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:21,399
reached out to figure out its own IP
address of the of the victim then tested

254
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:25,529
its connection hey smart enough to see
if the connection to the sea to server

255
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:31,779
will succeed and then once it succeeded
it actually began exfiltration so let's

256
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:36,419
look at how this went down the first
thing is that the victim of this attack

257
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:42,359
received an email when you receive
phishing emails in their terrible the

258
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,210
they're so obvious you see it and you're
like why would anyone fall for this

259
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:52,330
thing it is so obviously a fish right
but this one was really good if you read

260
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,019
this email us a couple of things you're
gonna notice first of all it's the

261
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:01,399
English is perfect second of all it's
about your volume license agreement with

262
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:07,820
Microsoft that means it's targeted to
corporate users third the user idea is

263
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,249
both in the front or in the two it's
also in the link itself so you know it

264
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:16,169
actually looks really the gentleman I
think I might have fallen for this one

265
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:21,619
so the user click the link and when the
user clicks the link

266
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:27,839
here's what happens they go to the
Microsoft site and the SSL certificate

267
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:34,820
matches so it matches no warnings are
anything but through a trick of

268
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,139
JavaScript in the way they've framed
this you actually get a download on the

269
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:44,248
download comes from this site called to
really company dot com that's the

270
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:49,679
compromise were WordPress server ok so
the user gets this download and it's a

271
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,910
zip file all users open zip files

272
00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:01,580
and then execute the code they always do
it and this user dead and so here's how

273
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,620
we saw at our security analyst the first
thing they saw was an alert on the alert

274
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,909
was something really cool feature called
retrospection which means we saw this

275
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:16,030
file which actually hosted the attack on
a php page and when we saw that

276
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:22,270
connection out of the php page at first
when we saw it it looked fine it was

277
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,970
benign but we later got intelligence
that was fed into the system that said

278
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,120
hey you know what

279
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,510
something I saw happened six hours ago I
now know is malicious so you should

280
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,670
probably take a look at it so the
analyst saw this alert and began to dig

281
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:40,460
into the attack so the first thing the
analyst did was went to that site and

282
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:47,510
downloaded the zip file on a safe system
you know a pristine system and when she

283
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,629
did she took that file and found that it
actually download zip file and so she

284
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,980
opened it up and she executed it in a
sandbox which is a really common tool

285
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,260
for investigations so she opened it up
she escalated she should put in a

286
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,830
sandbox and she found nothing happened
so she submitted the sample to

287
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,919
virustotal and virustotal said most
antivirus systems knew nothing about it

288
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,040
it was considered you know normal so
only nine of fifty seven actually

289
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,950
understood it to be malicious so she
said something's weird here so she

290
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,450
escalated into an investigator someone
who's much more senior who has more

291
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:30,430
experience the investigator now took
this and and ran it into more sand boxes

292
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,390
right as you got Joe box and cuckoo and
we have other commercial tools at our

293
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:40,020
disposal so he ran a couple more and he
just SAT there nothing happen you know

294
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,690
thirty minutes went by nothing nothing
nothing just time now she said you know

295
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:50,040
that something's weird so he ran this on
a physical system where he could do

296
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,120
memory capture you know just a debugger
right you can look at the file system

297
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,800
memory processes all that kind of stuff
and what he found was that within the

298
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,580
code it's just honestly timer just just
keep sleeping and waking sleeping in

299
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,269
waiting

300
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:11,080
and so we knew that it was actually did
it it could detect whether it's running

301
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,109
in a sandbox and just sleep the whole
time so he dug into this little further

302
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:21,428
he found that the malware the first
thing it did is it looked up using IPF I

303
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:25,239
dot org to figure out the IP address of
the victim now this is kind of

304
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:29,379
interesting because we're seeing more
and more that malware is figuring out

305
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:35,070
what country it's running in what
corporate network it's running in and it

306
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,539
may decide not to actually execute if
it's on a system where thinks a security

307
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,829
researcher is evaluating it right
because of the country the corporate IP

308
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:48,849
address and the timing even and so you
know it's it's actually pretty

309
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:54,499
interesting but then he saw its using
tor service toward the web dar un dot

310
00:24:54,499 --> 00:25:00,440
org of taxi get the DGA needed to get
the IP address needed to actually do the

311
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,959
commanding control so the investigator
took those ip addresses returned from

312
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:09,089
those within the code any looked through
all the NetFlow meeting all the network

313
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:13,749
telemetry coming in and out nothing
there was no indication of a compromise

314
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:19,089
so the attacker excuse me the
investigator raised the case to the

315
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:24,859
customer and what he said was this is
serious this is malware designed to to

316
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:29,289
compromise your systems but it's not yet
confirmed I have no indications that

317
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:32,889
your systems are breached so here's what
you should do

318
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:39,589
blocked the file hash block the agency's
IP addresses these domain names K and

319
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:43,549
the customer did that and there was no
further signs so the only thing that

320
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:47,329
happened as the malware was delivered no
indication that the matter was

321
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:51,969
successful in actually breaching that
system an actual trading data so that's

322
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:57,139
a sort of a happy ending the rare happy
ending of a security case but we learn

323
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:01,879
from that we know that by with attacks
like this the attackers are targeting

324
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:06,988
corporate users this not just about your
banking information anymore so the

325
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:11,820
attackers or after that second we we
learned that attackers are getting

326
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,799
better at evading sandboxes they're
figuring out how to right now where that

327
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,120
can detect sandbox that is running in it
and then invaded

328
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,840
we also learned that tour here is being
used for commanding control a lot of

329
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,330
corporate network still allowed tour but
we're increasingly seeing it used for

330
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,260
command control trip to Wolves a good
example and then lastly we were able to

331
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,410
block these which means will help the
customer moved down to the left on that

332
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:47,500
kill chain let me take you through a
second example this one has a lot more

333
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:56,960
sketchy so VPN VPN if you have the p.m.
back into the united states it's a great

334
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,780
way to watch Netflix right great way to
be able to watch stuff that for whatever

335
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,360
reason they want to block you from
otherwise so we may see people using VPN

336
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,030
for reasons other than just corporate I
T

337
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,730
we also know that people use tour for
legitimate reasons in certain countries

338
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,120
to get around firewall restriction that
that country may impose due to thwart

339
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,649
totalitarian politics they may use tour
as a way to get out to social media that

340
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,400
there that they're starved from right so
it can be a legitimate thing and that

341
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:36,650
one of R us' customers we found someone
hitting at or exit node ok so this is

342
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,330
one of the alerts that are investing our
analyst found so the analyst sees this

343
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:47,939
user heading out or exit node and when
she looked at the site she also found

344
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,380
under second alert that was that the
site that to which the user was

345
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,530
connecting the victim in this case is
not a victim and I'll show you why but

346
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:04,649
that the user was signed by Internet
Widgets Pty which is actually attributed

347
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,730
to certain types of malware that uses
this certificate signing authority so

348
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,190
hey you know what this looks kind of
weird so she sent this case up to the

349
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,170
investigator the investigator now look
through the traffic and found VPN

350
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,670
traffic going out through that door exit
node and we can actually see if you look

351
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,140
inside of here that is using something
called private Internet access

352
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,810
that's the name of the software

353
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:35,510
so the investigator now take takes that
case and rewind the tape and see that

354
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:42,100
going back several weeks there's NetFlow
indicating this person this user is VPN

355
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,330
and out of the corporate network using
tor exit notes to route traffic has

356
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,659
something looks kind of strange now as I
said earlier VPN and tour can be benign

357
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,820
because it can be someone who sort of a
security zealot like most of us who

358
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,610
doesn't want anyone looking at our
traffic including the corporate I T

359
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,409
Department it maybe someone in
authoritarian country but it can also be

360
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,390
someone who's searching for illegal
drugs

361
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,090
a hitman on Silk Road or whatever has
replaced Silk Road right so on a

362
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,730
corporate network these things are kinda
fishy so we raised the case to the

363
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,090
customer and again this is a low
priority case we said to the customer

364
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,659
hey this is potentially malicious
traffic you may have an insider who's

365
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,390
taking data and actual trading it out of
a network we don't believe it's malware

366
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:36,530
we we believe it's deliberate human
activity so the employee was interviewed

367
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:42,770
they asked him to remove the software
and that was the end of the story

368
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:49,340
what would you have done in my case as a
security investigator I would have done

369
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,750
two things first I would have looked
inside the network to see if he if this

370
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,140
employee was accessing sensitive
resources within the enterprise second

371
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,970
thing I would have done is I would have
done this trend exxon a system to see

372
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:06,980
where else he's gone and it may have
resulted in a dismissal but these are

373
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,530
the kinds of things that we see on
networks that require some you require

374
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,240
some thought you have to really think
about it it's not as simple as squashing

375
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:24,860
a bug squashing a virus now let's do one
more case this one I thought I enjoy

376
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,870
this case you may be familiar with a
piece of malware called China chopper

377
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:35,350
and China choppers really cool because
one of the capabilities it gives you is

378
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,500
if you connect successfully compromised
the server is this is something you

379
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,550
would typically used

380
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,840
to breach a server if you can
successfully compromised a server it

381
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,750
gives you a virtual terminal you can do
database management you can do file

382
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,190
system management you can you can do
command-line access i mean you it's like

383
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,780
you're right on the system it's it's
really a cool tool and so we detected

384
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,350
activity on this customer service by the
way this customers health care customer

385
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:08,340
in the same health care sector has been
targeted by this Chinese actor called

386
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,280
dynamite panda for years so we know that
this is a serious this is legitimate

387
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,450
concern but now by the way some of you
may have seen this a lot of companies

388
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,100
and I really cringe when I hear this as
soon as they see traffic to China or

389
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,740
Iran or places like that they want they
want to shut it down I said come on

390
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,020
there you may have customers there you
may have people who are interested in

391
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,710
your company they're just because it's a
tribute with a company that country

392
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,450
doesn't mean it's malicious in this case
it does because we know that this

393
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,930
particular malware is used by a Chinese
actor this Chinese actress specifically

394
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,900
actor after information in the
healthcare sector and so it raises the

395
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:54,840
alarm so our analysts Jesus and verifies
the alert now the analyst looked deeper

396
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:01,340
into the allure and sees that this is
indicative that what's happening is in

397
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:07,169
the users user files / file SNDA CER
which is sort of deep in the bowels of

398
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,830
the system definitely not something we
should see someone accessing from the

399
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,970
internet onto a web server ok this kind
of activity should be done by an admin

400
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:20,380
from inside the network not outside the
network so she raises the escalation to

401
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,010
an investigator the investigator now
here's what happens

402
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:30,410
investigator says hey this is clearly an
indication that your system customer is

403
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:35,700
being remotely controlled by an attacker
known to be an apt actor a nation state

404
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:42,310
whose compromise your system so we
raised a high priority case and I wonder

405
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,320
if any of you have ever seen this happen
before we told the customer is a serious

406
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,250
case you need to take the system offline
fully reimage it

407
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,820
Patchett before you bring back online

408
00:32:52,820 --> 00:33:00,759
the customer an antivirus said it didn't
find anything and closed the case he

409
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:06,769
said not so fast there's something wrong
we want you to take another look and

410
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:10,080
what are investigators found in this is
one of the beautiful things about for

411
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,139
packet capture the investigator found is
that if the attacker was live on the

412
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:15,658
system

413
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:19,980
live a live human attacker why how do we
know it's a human because they're making

414
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,960
mistakes they typed commands sexy the
system said I can't find that file

415
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:33,460
freaky corrected it to command IKEA see
so here we have evidence of a live human

416
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,840
attacker on the system we gave that
evidence back to the customer and when

417
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:44,269
we did the customer said ok ok they took
the system offline they rebuilt the

418
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:47,820
system they passed the system they
brought online and after that we kept

419
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,600
monitoring in the system kept getting
attacked but the attack wasn't

420
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,799
successful so we have to say hey good
news this thing is done so it's fun to

421
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,960
tell stories these are three things that
our staff and investigators doing the

422
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,119
last thing I want to say as as I close
out this discussion today is that our

423
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,089
service began in the United States I am
in Raleigh North Carolina beautiful

424
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:16,500
place we also have staff in Austin Texas

425
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,239
we have a site in Sydney Australia and
really pleased to tell you that over the

426
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,699
next few months we will complete a huge
security operation center beautiful

427
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:31,540
state of the art right here in Krakow
and will be hiring staff here in Cracow

428
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:38,219
and for the specific purpose of serving
customers in Europe seated right here in

429
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,259
Cracow at our beautiful facility here at
Cisco and that's really why I wanted to

430
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,700
come today is to begin this process of
introducing you making sure you know

431
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:52,868
Cisco is a security company we hire
elite security investigators to help

432
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:58,550
used these kinds of tools to help
customers find these attacks so that's

433
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,410
what I wanted to share with you today I
hope this has been useful as a way of

434
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,759
seeing the tools in action of the kind
of work that a security investigator

435
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,520
does

436
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:15,869
and I want to thank you for the time
today

437
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:25,759
respect the person asking your question
just ask for you to take conversation

438
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:30,609
outside to make it easy for them to hear
the answer thank you

439
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:38,288
hi I work for HP security you said the
day reimage the system completely were

440
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:44,369
you able to understand what was the
initial reason that got them hacked lake

441
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:48,589
was their vulnerability and software
they use because if they remade 121 like

442
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:52,819
the same versions of all the starters
they opened up the same hole but that

443
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,430
and a tiger succeeds against what they
do

444
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,279
right that time great question and then
decide to restate the question it is

445
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:03,619
okay great see you found the attack you
told the customer to fix it they reap

446
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,400
the ARIMA sisters and passed in writing
online but you're correct to observe

447
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,180
that we also understood the way the
attack succeeded in others was the

448
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,700
vulnerability that allowed it was
something in PHP they had like an added

449
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,078
a php module and we guided them to make
sure that was passed before they brought

450
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:29,040
it online so yes we did a great question

451
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,800
hi there my name is Jeff from the
University of Michigan question about

452
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:42,190
case one could you tell me the duration
between the detection to the analysis to

453
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,330
contacting the customer how long did
that take so Jeff your question in case

454
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,480
one I think that was the case of the
corporate volume license Trojan the one

455
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,340
that was like a Microsoft email right so
I just looking for a timeline here my

456
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,580
son is in Michigan's I smile you have
some affection for Michigan what's the

457
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:10,279
timeline I i off the top of my head what
actually let me tell you this we're

458
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,250
doing for package option which is
extraordinarily useful in our

459
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,920
investigations that also means you have
to be relatively fast because you know

460
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,610
it after three days it's gone and you
can really hold it for so long we have

461
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:27,300
staff that works 24 7 so this initial
detection and export of correlation to

462
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,010
knowing this is malicious happened
within a few hours and we then escalated

463
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:37,630
to the customer within just a few hours
so and the reason I'm confident in that

464
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:43,280
are two-fold one we have to be there
fast because of full packet capture we

465
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,260
can be that fast because of twenty-four
seven and we were able to observe that

466
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,170
the attack didn't succeed and actually
making any further progress to seeing

467
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,540
exfiltration we only saw indications of
them our being downloaded so just a few

468
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,580
hours

469
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,600
such that the customer was responsive
enough to put those blocks that that

470
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,680
mitigation in place

471
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,690
thank you

472
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:19,540
questions don't be shy now we're glad I
do you employ a penetration testers to

473
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,230
actually test how well you react to
actual attacks too similar to an actual

474
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:29,410
attack so the question is do we employ
penetration testers to test ourselves

475
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:42,540
and that's a really good question but we
don't tell you we do because it makes it

476
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,819
sound so much better I like her socially
with even the best penetration testers

477
00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:51,170
don't get past us but there's a couple
of reasons right number one

478
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:56,560
customers are still about penetration
testing like for example when we first

479
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,910
started engagement we run vulnerability
scans on it at work looking for you know

480
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,279
where you vulnerable so we can help you
prioritize us and they get kinda happy

481
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,839
about that because even you know as you
probably know even scanning can knock

482
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:15,890
over systems and so customers will
customers will actually give us their

483
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:20,339
vulnerability scanning information so we
can use it they say they sometimes let

484
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:23,310
us do it and they're getting a little
better with it and I think you're right

485
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,630
that we will come to a place here where
customers will say well look if you're

486
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,720
so great let me run my penetration
testing you guys tell me what you found

487
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,209
my old team in Cisco CSIR this happens
all the time someone will run a pen test

488
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,470
they wouldn't tell us about it we would
catch them and we would hey what are you

489
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:44,368
guys doing and it always felt great but
in my current team that's not happening

490
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:47,630
yet and I think it's largely because
customers are still kind of the kind of

491
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:51,589
customers they're really helped by us
they're not super mature yet IT security

492
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:56,470
so as they gain more maturity and
confidence I'm sure that they will use

493
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:03,669
penetration testers to test my team's
effectiveness ok

494
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:13,490
more questions what about doing his
command and control centers so if you

495
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:20,290
detectives there is some of ours it is
body is controlled by someone somewhere

496
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:29,160
thomasson's don't you just customers
rising dude just fix it but not figure

497
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:35,149
like new deal with the whole militias
not rock salt what i do to improve the

498
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,780
Internet from your Cisco

499
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,359
I think you're saying okay fine you you
find command control you inform the

500
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:47,500
Customer you get it cleaned up but what
are you doing to help address that I

501
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,059
think address the rest of the Internet

502
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:56,690
okay that's a good question I would say
that if you look at Cisco tell us which

503
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,500
is our our intelligence group and
they're the ones that are finding out

504
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,309
where they're the ones that couple
things we do one as my blog right so we

505
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:07,630
can share with customers I blogged about
this case hey here's what we're seeing

506
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,000
here is the attacks and whether working
we also have intelligence sharing it

507
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,530
goes out shadow server that sucks right
that's inside of Cisco so we we do a

508
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:21,450
number of things to help share
intelligence out both in open source

509
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:26,990
with the ice axe and trusted partners
etc but we're not doing things like

510
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,578
takedowns right we're not doing that
kind of stuff we're not involved and we

511
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:35,910
will cooperate and takedowns where it's
useful but it's not a first priority for

512
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,740
us right the first priority is to help
defend the victims good good question

513
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,859
and i hope i and I answered honestly it
may not be satisfying but that's that's

514
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:57,348
really how we do it

515
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:04,299
just a quick remark one of the reasons
of course way sorry my external

516
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:09,720
consultant working in the idea security
area and I have a large corporate

517
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,999
customers what we're seeing is that they
have a huge welfare infrastructure and I

518
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,868
love the Tigers try to find out the real
physical IP addresses to just bypassed

519
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:23,700
the laughs that's very common way of
gaining access because very often where

520
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,950
some are configured and they will not
block on physical copies they will just

521
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,489
leave it to the domain name and once you
have the real IP you your past it it's

522
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:36,279
interesting so here is your observation
is that attack wife is great but

523
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:39,749
customers will will

524
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:44,828
attackers will just essentially use the
ip address and no DNS lookup is needed

525
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:49,099
which means it can get right through
that stuff now by the way my team as a

526
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,729
hunting playbook so their specific hunts
that our investigators will run through

527
00:42:53,729 --> 00:42:58,749
data and one of the hunts they employ is
looking for a connection out to asset

528
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:03,209
without at a requisite DNS lookup which
would help us discover that kind of

529
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,339
activity but it's interesting you know
there's there certain techniques that

530
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:11,170
attackers will use where that's
relatively easy to get past software

531
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:15,749
defenses and hardware defenses where our
investigators can use their heads to to

532
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:23,859
look for that kind of stuff so great
great remark and I would agree more

533
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:33,730
questions and comments

534
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:39,320
ok I think we should end here thank you
for questions I'd be very happy to talk

535
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,260
with you afterwards and thanks for the
invitation to come I'm really glad to

536
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,180
support this this conference and glad to
see such great turnout here thank you

537
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:48,330
again
