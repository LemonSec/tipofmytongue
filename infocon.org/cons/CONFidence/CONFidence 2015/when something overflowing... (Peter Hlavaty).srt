1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
so I have to be able to talk about can
exploit Asian about some but also send

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,559
you some new technique and complicated
we go through some centric boeing's

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,448
being torn something affordable from Flo
interview some new posting technique and

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:26,449
really awesome slope slope and other
things and we'll take it by example

5
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:34,880
which we discovered last year those be
some are modified trains each other by

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:43,120
2004 and rates and they discovered this
in internment during phone switch

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:51,328
because this back by selecting from 2012
and but it's applicable for mobile

8
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:59,829
defense and the current market and we're
going to have a diverse cuisine just saw

9
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,900
to trade so one of the reasons I think
the side of the pipe before us and the

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:16,100
other one just just goes to spice
functions and it was back at by bus for

11
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:24,119
us and we just basically the index on
the counter of the bus and that means it

12
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:31,280
was out of luck in getting the size and
in this spice to pipe and what's

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,750
happened is that when you have thought
this by before us

14
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:45,640
glowing six if you're not out if you'll
do fine so basically use local steak and

15
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:54,470
when's the big value came out the buffer
zone the pool and in this case which was

16
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:02,950
the one o'clock it was that it was
racing to increase the counter and it

17
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:09,660
was it was used before you start but was
formed from steak but at the end it was

18
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,120
check this value again

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:19,659
and it's it's ok feeling that the books
books and but its own steak and steak

20
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:26,950
means panic but it is not the case of
these partner function and spice but it

21
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:34,929
wasn't used in a presence on many other
functions and we choose the candidate it

22
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:42,079
was a false false positive rates and
also perfect because it's free buffers

23
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:49,549
33 members on the state which can be
used and in the one of the members you

24
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,090
can or fights with pointer and they've
paid twice and this point or points to

25
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:02,799
your your data which can be controls and
it can cause the stego for and that's

26
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:09,220
nice that's one of the only nation is
that the overflow before somebody under

27
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:17,389
cannot point toward that end and the
size the second- second was a shoe that

28
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:24,290
inundated with plenty plenty rooms that
means that implements some experts 41

29
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:31,310
alone and in which you saw the steak
looks like on their own because the

30
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,980
Pentagon completes its compiled about
something returns etc so if you have too

31
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,619
many goat by attacking the stake in this
case is possible because no candidates

32
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:51,250
including its ratings in this function
and in this case you can you can target

33
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,519
the written pointer or contact the
parents or local variables but every

34
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,370
time then targets different songs you
have to specify because they like the

35
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,940
looks different

36
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,220
and doing this phone is possible because
it's a panic but keeping on the steak

37
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,850
and its most likely happened both times
but you can you have an option the race

38
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,110
two times the first time to increase its
stake and second time before it will be

39
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,890
fun like a free vacation again but in
this case the possibility to do it

40
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:33,409
because it's moving though for racing 2
times that's the first thing and second

41
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:40,660
thing is that even though you do its
needs to end without problems that can

42
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,770
be a problem and see the real bill you
know so what's next but next can be

43
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:53,640
bought from Buffalo you can also to pull
not to stick and static will be that's

44
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:00,969
you will at the beginning you were right
it will be this type of us will be not

45
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,070
I'll get on the fast pace result from
steak but if it'll be too came out from

46
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:14,710
two came out and you will grace to be
even bigger available at the pool and so

47
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,200
i dnt Denver became for a titillating is
fine you just over the pool and it can

48
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,479
survive I don't the problem is that
helpful not only with one structure also

49
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,240
be some kind of an appointment size but
also to under members which is

50
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,440
overflowing same time so that means that
your for not only the far from one slap

51
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,730
but your fault and three different
places at the same time so it can be a

52
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,160
big problem then you want to build some
stabilization or something

53
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,860
soviet and later this month and then to
think that I mentioned before that in

54
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,700
this case you not overflow of data
before we cannot enter and leave the

55
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,190
pace ice and the kind of pointer is this
speech if one feature that six points to

56
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:10,710
your into that to your data which can
control but the sites we can restore

57
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:18,140
follow from free places and we can we
can just come to but for this its owner

58
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:25,190
that means that it will fail by reading
to our cannot pointed to some memory

59
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:31,890
which points up on that too but these
are side effects that that means that on

60
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,370
this memory which is which cannot point
of two it's not control that anymore but

61
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,890
on the other side sits its big process
it because loss is that your vote just

62
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,969
only with 22 barbarous and two places at
one time not a different places so it

63
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:54,900
can escalate the exploitation rights but
that means you know you're not able to

64
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:03,409
control it anymore only if you don't you
suppose pray and can be kinda heart

65
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:11,070
especially when you have sixty platform
and but for that interview some new

66
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:20,729
technique be values there was also the
first place function because of the out

67
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:28,060
our page which is basically allocate for
any page and reads which reached the

68
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:35,910
data to the page but it if on the other
side some problem because you can

69
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:44,750
allocate you can create only about 200
fives in one process so it can be a

70
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,190
problem but on the site when you can
allow this position on the musician not

71
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,440
scan assassination but when you look
later if you became out from under my

72
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,360
memory basically it's good enough
because then you have for example one of

73
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,789
these pipes and every time you tried to
allocate some memory is something going

74
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:12,599
to place so many times and you will
cover just base and see basically feel

75
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,248
although to base with your partner

76
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:24,259
but it's kinda complicated because you
need to use pipe and sheep that despite

77
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:31,969
obvious spice and take the same time the
US postal rates function but for the

78
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:37,849
past four sockets for pipe its it took
sound and the function but forty ti

79
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:45,279
exactly function that needs and four
days just use pipe spicing to the rights

80
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:52,589
to write a TI spice to pipe and we got
it and reaping its main Times writes for

81
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:58,470
a few seconds and he gets its memory and
sits right by it because you just how

82
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:06,230
about what's a 500 alt pipes and it's
not my position but you feel all can now

83
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:16,670
with butter and when it comes to
implementing this kind of thing not easy

84
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:24,660
it's tough say it has all the four steps
are trying to fulfill its implements

85
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:32,139
come under some some mechanism some
invaded you under under protective are

86
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:37,000
able to so thats why these are made
there at the end you just end of this

87
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,420
month thats just provide the best
friends as a buffer and the bills pray

88
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:48,089
for the memory and provide for you but
but for some time frame to be the most

89
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:55,319
places like sports editor content and
same time by the cemetery's because many

90
00:09:55,319 --> 00:10:04,229
implements the scandal nobody like spice
it also need seldom steps because he

91
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,569
needs approval few steps and after the
battle for the steps and scan the

92
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,599
complicated process because it's
different

93
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,100
exploitation these days like it was
before 10 years now its makes a broken

94
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,089
zipper exploitation its kinda coming to
be difficult task into needs some

95
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:26,990
engineering

96
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:38,860
with insights and it's more like a
developer less than the other and so on

97
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:45,870
assets said that ok now we can we can
spare data we can all but the problem is

98
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,810
that still need to fall to something
that you only control and four days can

99
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,599
have some words for example someone
limitation when it comes to came out the

100
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:05,270
tanks and also that but in some fashion
because when you get some from came out

101
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:14,110
it was just returned from some current
slap and organized by size and every

102
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:20,899
time it's basically mbira Jackson was
like so what's the plan

103
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,690
line is that the operator mention many
memories

104
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:32,050
many memory objects the same size so
that means you create a lot of slaps so

105
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:39,130
you will create and empty slots and two
i didnt text that they will three points

106
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,950
that it will free some some of the
objects and then tried to allocate your

107
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:50,279
bathroom blunt object which which can be
evolved from and later on it will pop

108
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:56,829
over and potent it can be also it's not
sustainable and seats can be some

109
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:03,099
experimenting but this idea which works
it's not so funny person but it's folks

110
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,850
quite stable

111
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:15,230
what's gonna complications explains it's
also not too much does not want this

112
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:23,410
case but in all the other experts in
this case that separation that means

113
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:29,819
that for example in extreme cases is
something that maintains used for

114
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:35,410
different objects have some different
cases and that means that this case is

115
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:41,029
only subject or something or other
objects but you cannot you can object

116
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:46,370
that such a problem that many markets
from this from discussions let you look

117
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,649
at sort of tanks and but you can also
wanted to this but you can control it

118
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:57,430
but forties is also can can solve it
basically because the case resources

119
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,469
just chunk of memory and can convince
feel when school is out to be al-qaida's

120
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:08,370
new one that can be your point that you
knew you cannot afford for these objects

121
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:16,110
into positions right after that buffer
from economical social that cash game

122
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:23,939
being like in this way but it's more
complicated and it's easier because it's

123
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:32,459
a litigious asians and every session
it's all the objects and these and other

124
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:40,500
objects which al-qaida are free and some
would control the contents I called

125
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,389
Emily powerful jets and so it's no big
deal

126
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:52,110
like from the kennel cases so why is
this possible because I think

127
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,480
securing that operating system its

128
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,079
should be mitigated by these are at
least Buffalo but for like you know it's

129
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:07,709
nowadays because the main points of this
means that you can help from his remote

130
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:14,258
likely to control our gate or free kick
the can down the thing is that you can

131
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,889
control the contents or

132
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:23,609
can cancel at fooling the contents that
you can have the same data except some

133
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:29,410
had predicted that ok there will be some
something . there are some members which

134
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,559
know the decisive good not tired and
these investments you can control that

135
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:40,660
objects and among people in the early
seventies objects some pointers to

136
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:46,919
functions on the bus which can be later
overturned the winner waiting and can be

137
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:57,319
misused and also and this cannot open
systems can also are going to be going

138
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:02,238
tips is ok because I think it's right
way to go because any other party

139
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:09,109
introduced into the canal but for this
unit some integrity checks because 120

140
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:14,959
once out of the objects you can point of
the cannot and that's a big deal on the

141
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:24,419
thing is that the 64 bit or 64 bit other
space and it's it's introduced a new

142
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:32,119
opportunities and basically you will be
some security system that's every child

143
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:38,410
can be well like it's basically its
pages but I think that you have before

144
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:45,009
and after some something else you catch
both of those killed and susceptible to

145
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:51,769
60 platform it's ok it's maybe it's not
going to be very efficient but it can

146
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:59,020
sum up late and can be going to the
direction

147
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:05,750
space-based so about this it doesn't
that sound bites means for the spice

148
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:14,830
that such again the bus back because
racing was repeating but what was not

149
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:20,660
permitted was that you or for at least
two before us and the same time so that

150
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:26,839
means that it's not stable too much
because you can't own some buffer but

151
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:34,220
mean value and the memory in some kind
of so stocks fell upon its in level you

152
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:41,770
have to fix these issues and we have to
have some weights at the end it was

153
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:49,850
about I think one-half of reform for
success and heels of showed you how to

154
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:56,710
spray that you cannot memory and faster
till some ideas how to play its part but

155
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:01,910
when you want to play more video on
everything you need to do some research

156
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:07,940
about what is your target because the
state's bTW you over four weeks some

157
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:14,160
kind of pointer a pitch sites it is the
pattern which is a beating and you need

158
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,580
to find a target because for example for
us to have some fun everything in detail

159
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:26,399
before us and it was used some good
techniques that it was also want to get

160
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,520
a power structure and its introduced
elder some function pointers but on the

161
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:38,690
other side it includes also some magic
and venue already is magic you panic in

162
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,950
this case you can't the Reds magic
because you're right just cannot point

163
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:52,420
of it and the problem and other things
that needs for the police 64 bit yes

164
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:58,530
it's going to be able to also doctor's
permission and execution operation at

165
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,399
this time or data so it's very good to
replace these things

166
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,910
and that was that

167
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:14,580
48 was not a bother but we need to
interview some think the one thing was

168
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:22,629
for this when you tryin to you can
control the bathroom but 22 December

169
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,490
interscope because you can awful to not
to every size but only to the specified

170
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,420
sizes 16 3042 and etc but it's
multiplied by size of pointer so you end

171
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:44,780
up with its slabs which you can use and
for this you can find the target and

172
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:52,550
less time in currents in contact with
skin is going some problems with some

173
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:59,480
sort of security and research and I want
to interact with on this one because

174
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:07,600
usually at a train victor is that
republicans if antivirus and its protect

175
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,879
you and the companies from getting
compromised but the change is that at

176
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,140
first time you need to get somehow into
other computer and for that in some

177
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,880
social social or someone everything and
for example the focus on the meetings

178
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,910
and so many good liberty is not the
thing that's now is sparked a solution

179
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:37,340
that it's somehow how to present to
install computer is that you

180
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:43,659
limits the 10 days that it does this
year days and that means that he will

181
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:50,630
not be far more expensive to research
and to what extent target because one

182
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:59,720
time when many things basically phone
system it's game over game over for

183
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,380
especially for the company's for user
maybe not but for companies it's game

184
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:10,310
over so I think that brought this action
is necessary and forties

185
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:21,450
eye-popping calculator calculator
killing although Roberts and what's the

186
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,850
price its only other filings and we are
going to this direction but it's doing

187
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:35,870
it understands this technology in four
days later that support securities

188
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:44,580
because it's very important its projects
especially companies out of conference

189
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:51,480
in San tell the guys asking me what we
are doing and we are based in China and

190
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:59,180
the vr6 security sectors and basically
that's and we do all the stops and this

191
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:05,800
country's kind of story that's at the
beginning we are all members are the

192
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:14,980
people from the good very good security
base and cosmetics out of gas working

193
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,170
for Microsoft before and so therefore I
was working before front of us company

194
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:27,490
and so the other guys was working for
some other security companies also some

195
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,310
of the guys were smoking for because
you're doing Shetty to cover the

196
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:40,450
rollbacks and we also not until the tone
for consecutive years we get some

197
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:51,040
results from there the machete and make
some point even something like pontoon

198
00:21:51,040 --> 00:22:01,300
boat for devices and we also supports
the young guys CPF games for example we

199
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,620
have some intense

200
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:11,909
your CPF for Bluetooth earphones the
cold capes and the gate and also she

201
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:17,420
rubs and dildos qualified for this and
also be doing something for the greeks

202
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:28,280
we last year we also get some new one
everything and operates and then

203
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,440
everything's been good some of them but
they put it past and as this time their

204
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,970
products and also afterwards we make
some tool for four weeks but can routing

205
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:48,430
basics and other things that we
introduce new techniques and try to

206
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,930
share of people I make some highlights
for example of make some protection

207
00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:01,460
techniques also makes how to play this
page tables and pointed out by the roots

208
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:09,280
and also have introduced in public this
framework for the people and sourcing

209
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:17,560
the this time building present something
out to buy one get sleep basically by

210
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:24,070
right very you can hold the candel
including the prosecution and also team

211
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:30,210
trying to share knowledge of all diets
this is just some highlights but also

212
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,940
mention that dozens of China domestic
conferences or lectures and universities

213
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,530
to be trying to share and spread
knowledge not to think that I said

214
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:47,430
that's how team creating the event which
is basically a down even when you can

215
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:53,290
choose your own device and try to point
it just sends your proposal proposal to

216
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,230
us and anything that it's a really good
you can go you can go for it and maybe

217
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:12,060
some magic date about 10 24 October and
these will be second best that's all I

218
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:19,550
did the same for thats we are told in
terms of the questions you can pick up

219
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:25,620
some shirts if you want from our even so
if you have any questions

220
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,820
property manager exploits station just
ask any others just a scapegoat baby

221
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:46,040
transfer hi I have a question can you
share some knowledge how or what tools

222
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,280
do you use when you're writing a kernel
exploit because once you trigger

223
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,740
depending obviously there is a problem
but there is a lot of small steps that

224
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,510
you need to when you're working on your
next load did you have any can you share

225
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,350
some of your experience was the best
approach and how to achieve it is much

226
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,100
easier and users but when your internal
obviously kernel panic and you need to

227
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:17,800
start all over 40 for example Bristol
415 can only mean dose is BBB yeah yeah

228
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:27,230
and 40 for this month we also work then
you can basically came after you get

229
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:33,929
some experts you want maybe some to some
kind of a driver and it's easier to pass

230
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:40,070
you can put you can basically write the
kind of a driver inside and just a

231
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,649
miracle to jump from simple to be
described as the one thing that second

232
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:51,520
thing is that's the kind of exploitation
it's not so hot it is getting some just

233
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,750
it just be sense about knowledge but the
venom trying to go inside the Cano and

234
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:02,990
how it's kind of Orcs it's as easy as
you some things even easier as my device

235
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:09,910
for example lease tried to a company
tried to reproduce and try to get back

236
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,660
its looks like and there's something
analyze these and they just started

237
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,900
playing with for example some shopping
framework introducing some coding sites

238
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:25,559
and experiment and you can basically a
burger and this kind of framework can be

239
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:41,129
your basement

240
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,290
thank you very much
