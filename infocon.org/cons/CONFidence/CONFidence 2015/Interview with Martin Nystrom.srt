1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,410
cool

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,930
so we're at the confidence conference on
crack oh and my guess is Marty Nystrom

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,100
from Cisco

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,219
hello hello starting to please introduce
yourself what do you do basically

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,500
sure I run Cisco's active threat
analytics

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,840
program and we we monitor customers
networks for advanced attacks 24 hours a

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,350
day

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,070
seven days a week but also know that you
are a.m.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,359
monitoring did cooperate the ethics and
corporate networks

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,500
and could you tell us how much of them
there

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,550
hambre sure if you think Ive

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,760
all the data coming in and out of our
customers networks there are

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,540
hundreds AFP thousands other events and
attacks occurring

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,879
everyday on corporate networks an and
one other

15
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:53,480
most important things we do is to winnow
down that data

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,828
so that we only talk to customers when
we find something serious enough

17
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,289
for example a successful attack that
weekend

18
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,989
study it and then reach out to them to
very quickly mitigate

19
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,759
and remediate that attack and what was
the title

20
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,470
love your speech today what were you
speaking about I talked about real-world

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,520
I think we'll see real-world threats yet
the real world trade happen because

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,179
that's right yeah I real-world
red-handed

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,930
that's right and and I'll the whole
point was I want the audience to

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,270
understand what we're seeing

25
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,658
right because there's a big difference
between was theoretical what's possible

26
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:34,090
and what's actually happening so if you
study the way attacks are working today

27
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,439
the attackers are very successful at
finding the soft spots which are always

28
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,139
you and me

29
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,630
the way when we open email and browse
the web sites and

30
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,869
and I highlighted three specific
examples

31
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:49,030
I've have different kinds of attacks you
seen and then how we helped our

32
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,720
customers

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,048
safely mitigate and then remediate those
breaches on their networks

34
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,790
so how can a single user defend from it
well

35
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,270
most importantly on just be suspicious
self you receive an e-mail

36
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,360
let's say today you'll need somebody

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,910
and they may the reach out to you with
an email it's a LinkedIn request it may

38
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,720
be a tweet

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,910
I Instagram message and they may be
friend you

40
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,549
and then they may send you a document
and ask you to open it perhaps it to

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,740
resume or an invitation to a party

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,770
I'm and so your defenses are lowered
you'll then open that

43
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,110
and that's when the attack happens so be
suspicious be careful the way

44
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,120
you when you interact with people and
and he should be on guard about how you

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,740
open and look at things

46
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,130
and eating his attire to is it's hard to
find a good security experts nowadays

47
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,820
it is and that's a double-edged sword
because that means

48
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,940
on people like me and and most have the
speakers and attendees here are security

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,650
professionals

50
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,160
I meet the job market is good for us
we're finding job getting paid well

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,680
I'm it also means people like me for
hiring security professionals many of

52
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,040
whom

53
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,350
right here in Krakow will be hiring and
it means we

54
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,299
we have to hunt harder for those
security experts and I'm

55
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,060
so it works both ways I can is there any
country that has smaller disagreed

56
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,140
exposed and the other

57
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,179
that's a good question I I don't know
that I could say some have

58
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,170
better programs than others in the
United States for example at the

59
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,850
universities are adding great programs
and I into their IT departments and

60
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,609
other programs

61
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,190
the US government is investing in he
actually in the military and security

62
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,570
training in at in order to recruit and
attract that talent

63
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,350
on and honestly it it should be securely
should be a part of everyone's education

64
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,780
in it. on so I'm not sure some some
countries do a better than others but I

65
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,930
will tell you that the reason cisco has
selected poland

66
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,970
to make an investment in a technology
center in hiring

67
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,209
is because of the education that we're
seeing here in poland

68
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,950
and the kind have professionals were
saying we've specifically targeted this

69
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,500
reason

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,320
region because the availability of
talent in the education and I love the

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,980
people here

72
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,920
that's something to be proud about yes
well except for the fact that you were

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
speaker today you are also lemme Cisco's
also they're putting in partner of her

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,640
confidence

75
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,529
why have it isn't the specific event

76
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,910
well because when I had the privilege of
coming to Krakow

77
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,589
about three months ago beautiful
beautiful visit had a wonderful time

78
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,440
and when I came I met Andre and above
upright prodi a

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,219
pro I say I would say pro idea cuz
that's how it looks and Android that I

80
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,430
know now I know

81
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,770
night out on but when I met him he he
suggested the conference as a way to

82
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,580
recruit

83
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,039
rice a very you know unashamedly I want

84
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,690
security professionals to think if Cisco
as a place they would like to have

85
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,020
in their career on and so I thought if I
sponsor the conference

86
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,770
here's a good way to make introduction
and deal to meet people and gained start

87
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,289
to build their interest in Cisco as a
serious security employer

88
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,700
nice I mean I know there are some
plastic next addition

89
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,210
will be filled with Malone more students
so that's the aim to get

90
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,450
it's a great way to get started to we in
the US where hiring interns people who

91
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,450
are still in college

92
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,280
giving them exposure to you know being
in security monitoring investigation

93
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,780
it's a bit like being a firefighter

94
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,438
because you gotta be in there a wall the
attacks are happening studying damning

95
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,869
and all the time and on it's a very
important part anyone security

96
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:19,869
educationist

97
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:24,129
sure to be a firefighter so is that the
cap is part of being a security expert

98
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:28,519
well but you know I've spent years a
having to be up all night working on

99
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,009
security investigations

100
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:33,499
and I'm its hard work it's sleepy work

101
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,809
but it's an important part of everyone's
education I think everyone should do it

102
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,099
at least for a time

103
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:41,149
so that there can nected to the way real

104
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:46,399
attacks happen alright and as my last
question I would like to ask you

105
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,279
hold your comments to attend such even
slight confidence to the experts are to

106
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,219
the students are ok we should appear
here

107
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:56,339
well i i tell you it that's a good
question obviously students will enjoy

108
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,009
being here because it's a relaxed fun
atmosphere there's bean bags and

109
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,919
games and even some beers over there I'm
so students will have a great time here

110
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,058
people who are young in their careers
who want to gain some experience and

111
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:09,099
other disciplines

112
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:13,800
and get a job but I'll tell you that I
have a number I've years experience

113
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,099
actually 13 years experience in security

114
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:20,128
and I'm learning things here today so I
think even people who are seasoned

115
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,309
in their security career will be able to
find things here

116
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:26,619
that will be both entertaining and
educational

117
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:31,129
that's very nice to hear okay thank you
for the serbs conversation

118
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:41,260
thank you for the time but

119
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,289
on
