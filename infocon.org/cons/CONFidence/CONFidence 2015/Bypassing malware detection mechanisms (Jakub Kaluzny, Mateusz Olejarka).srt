1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
hello everyone I have disliked flight
into my face so I don't see you a lot

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,219
but I would like to welcome you and to
get on my knees together with my

3
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:18,460
colleagues hope we are going to talk
about how to bypass morrow detection

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:27,510
mechanisms deployed in online banking ok
thank you all for coming because it's i

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,930
think quite late so what we do we are
both mental SYSOUT securing company is a

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,530
company based in Krakow before that we
both house have experience as a software

7
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:48,520
developers in our current occupation we
mostly taste as I said we are

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,300
professionals mostly

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,569
banking sites mobile applications web
applications related to financial sector

10
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,629
we have tested multiple multi-factor
systems multi-factor authentication for

11
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:13,130
certification systems also we did some
more analysis post-mortem and we help

12
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,869
our customers to stop and going moderate
tax ok that would be short about us

13
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,470
this is the agenda for today we are
going to start with such small

14
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:33,570
introduction to give you a call concepts
related to mother to and from our two to

15
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,408
start to discuss then we will discuss
potential attack vectors on script based

16
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,480
Muller

17
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,740
script based on tomorrow's elections and
then we will go through recommendations

18
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,630
for improvement in such solutions and
later on we are we want to discuss with

19
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:02,360
you I work so I pass the mic to cuba who
dis do this introduction part ok so

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,890
first we have to answer a simple
question why this topic is so

21
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:15,010
interesting well why is it hard to
protect online banking applications

22
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:21,310
against malware or viruses like this
time they are stand-alone executables

23
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,380
are not reliable you can sign for
example the virus fight to virustotal or

24
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,680
any other service and you can see that
not every antivirus catches positively

25
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,220
so the second thing is that our lazy
they do not want to install stand-alone

26
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:48,940
executables click 10 times then use
space or the discs and and anything all

27
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,840
the question for you are you lazy I
would like a simple question supposing

28
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,050
you you're sending transfer your online
banking applications for example it's

29
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,270
invoice for telecommunication services
you open your invoice for your copy your

30
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:16,250
bank account on dress on the first page
in the bank you you just paste this

31
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:25,150
address type your amount on the second
page you have to pass code which you

32
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,540
received on the second tunnel in the SMS
what do you do what do you compare of

33
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:38,660
course we compare the amount and you
compared the banking godless we fought

34
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:45,490
what what we compared with the screen
then you're lazy then you're lazy

35
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,950
because some of my where some of the
model where can change what you see on

36
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,810
the screen because it's in the banking
in the browser application what you

37
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,990
should do is actually comparing it to
the paper invoice or at least invoice in

38
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:07,640
the PDF file right ok so so there is a
market cap for new solutions on the

39
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:16,209
market the solutions which work in the
browser's which our client list in the

40
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,170
mean of you don't need to install any
standalone application you just you're

41
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:29,210
just a simple client who opened banking
website and all the magic stuff for

42
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,870
detection mechanism is done
automatically and that the last thing is

43
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:40,280
there is a lot of money and banking
industry we all know that ok so how does

44
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,979
my work or actually how the some of my
work first of all it interacts with the

45
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,990
browser using web being jerks most of my
most of banking model or does it do you

46
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,169
sweat being text we just small
JavaScript code which is included into

47
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:06,659
the into the banking website it's done
actually on the client side so so they

48
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,890
intercepted between the server and the
client

49
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:15,360
sometimes it works the other way for
example by changing the process memory

50
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,730
of the brosser changing banking account
address you know these mower so what is

51
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,610
the purpose of banking of course it's
still credentials to the banking

52
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,480
application intended transaction data to
steal the money and sometimes it

53
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:41,919
automates attacks by for example
clicking simulating user clicks or

54
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,280
actions

55
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:53,489
so how does JavaScript based malware
detection works so aim is to detect

56
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,440
our presence and it can work on
different layers so here is like a

57
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,460
simple diagram of of the data flow when
the user open the banking website so the

58
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:14,650
mechanism can catch signatures of the
HTTP response from the server to the

59
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:22,669
browser it can fingerprints the
terrorist groups and the block in the

60
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:28,799
brother of course it can fingerprint
user and blossom behavior I mean the

61
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,640
speed of clicking the speed of typing
letters and mouse movement that's how

62
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,320
Google recapturing the works of course
in the back there is some production

63
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:47,360
system which analyzes transactional data
and our detecting system can work also

64
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,780
there so the action of this solution is
to drop a remark sessions as compromised

65
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,049
what are the limits of the solution
these are the metals I mentioned before

66
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:08,060
her got a simple simple graph of
marketing audit ability of the solutions

67
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:17,590
and by marketing I mean marketing power
of of saying such phrases so when a

68
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:24,330
marketing person goes into the bank and
assay our solution uses HTTP response of

69
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:31,130
nature people from the bank ok why not
and also the ability of this is very big

70
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,810
like you can of course check which are
this which signatures which model

71
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,080
by the signatures and so on but when the
marketing person goes into the bank and

72
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,889
say oK we've got some fraud detection
system which uses a must in learning

73
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:55,860
deep learning and big data cloud systems
apt then the marketing of this is you

74
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:05,669
know why don't you know this is quite
hard recently we've been testing some

75
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:11,180
voice recognition technology actually
its voice authentication to the bank

76
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:18,510
we found some vulnerability we've been
able to bypass authentication voice

77
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:26,260
authentication once and for defender
actually wants is OK I posted one's

78
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:34,919
learning big data cloud computing system
updated to your apt I can't now we are

79
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,890
we are not vulnerable but okay come on
in place of banking I think once is

80
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,159
enough

81
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,179
ok small disclaimer

82
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,420
we do not represent any vendor we do not
create such solutions we can close out

83
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,339
one if you want we want to show mainly
implementation and architecture error

84
00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:01,320
source the whole idea of script based
anti-malware and we want to talk about

85
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,870
what can be done to get the solutions
better so

86
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:14,040
victors for client using online banking
applications

87
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,870
our approach of testing was to meet the
brosser we've some underwear allies to

88
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:27,290
JavaScript of this detection solution
which comes from the web server analyzed

89
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:33,000
outgoing traffic and sometimes we had
access to the administrative interface

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,209
in the transactional system it was for
example other main console to view logs

91
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:44,479
and see the colors of the solution

92
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:54,410
I so our first idea was simple it's not
magic really we were intercepting a

93
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,100
sleepy trusting in the clean machine

94
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,440
infected machine we did some action
let's say that actually was to login

95
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,930
into bank what we see we did some JS
analyzes and we've seen that on the

96
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,979
infected machines are some different
paths different subdomains there were a

97
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,800
lot of base 64 strings which didn't
appear in the clinching traffic and

98
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:27,750
we've seen some encryption are symmetric
keys and so on so what we did actually

99
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,800
counting this HTTP requests we seeing
that on the cleaning machine we've got

100
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,859
just simple one action and on the
infected machine we've got something

101
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:45,699
more so what would you do issue if you
are operating model we're actually

102
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:50,990
creating a model where and you'll see
that your mother were on the infected

103
00:10:50,990 --> 00:11:00,990
machine creates more HTTP requests what
would you do

104
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:11,940
one more time

105
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,820
ok well I mean we analyzed and we see
that this is a little bit stronger line

106
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:27,260
is is the requests we think that it is
prices there is money order anybody else

107
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:37,740
yeah I'd like so just disable these DVDs
SDP request and actually like if it

108
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,339
bleeds we can kill it so we we just for
example change DNS of these sub-domain

109
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,839
or just a sleepy request we can do this
in javascript no problem and its

110
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:58,070
bypassed so like for example for his use
family model where disabling the HTTP

111
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:05,279
request this other song request is just
like one line of code and it shows us a

112
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:12,339
bigger architecture problem because
actually like on a business level this

113
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:20,200
solution work by sending a red light so
the anti-malware magic script sends the

114
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,810
red light this machine is infected

115
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:31,930
why not send the red or green light
instead so all signatures check if there

116
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:42,520
was more aware and finally sent this
machine is generally no matter where we

117
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:53,089
called adverse inference ok so once the
mower was spotted we found 10 bility in

118
00:12:53,089 --> 00:13:01,050
a few solutions in this red light
request there was there was another

119
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:07,029
solid contain some data logging of the
user the time and the behavior or

120
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,740
sometimes in the behavior it was said it
is suspicious sometimes it was even

121
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:22,500
the name of the malware so what would
you do for example this request if the

122
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,110
browser sends the request of of the
alert why not change it and so it's ok

123
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,230
this this machine is not infected its
machine off user to affected and

124
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:40,930
actually it worked pretty well so in the
other interface when we viewed the logs

125
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,180
you can see that there was no suspicious
activity from either one but from the

126
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:55,030
user to ok and last thing the like I
think most money for me was the first

127
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:03,760
things first so if this magic is a big
bunch of various groups its takes some

128
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,360
time to load the dumbest trade right we
we've been testing dissolution for such

129
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,210
a long time that I've been doing some
well it was not it was money well

130
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,510
testing but I was really doing it fast
so freaking blogging clicking blogging

131
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:29,220
typing passport and some at some point
on the infected machine locked so fast

132
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,430
fast enough that the anti-malware magic
didn't work it's because of the red line

133
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,500
is because of the red green

134
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,740
red green architecture problem
JavaScript download so I was able to log

135
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:54,130
on the infected machine with no other
well I possible thanks

136
00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:00,840
ok so now we're going out to deep dive
into how this nature stuff works

137
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,760
brilliantly on the client side we have
some script JavaScript coyotes fall to

138
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,069
US sales are because JavaScript ease the
load it from the server actually you can

139
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,430
see it from the process itself out on
the other side on the server side we

140
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,989
have some API you related to this
solution of game and we have some

141
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:29,740
signatures present on the client site
will discuss it in a moment this is one

142
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,230
part of the second one is some reasoning
engine something which decides we are

143
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:41,990
going to send this art or not sometimes
it was related to some encryption a

144
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,570
symmetric encryption and still here

145
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,350
encryption is ok but you have to
remember that if Javascript and trips

146
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:57,870
and I think the public is also present
there so I was discussed this example

147
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:03,900
the message with the login user while
and user to was encrypted but still we

148
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,459
had to encryption key so the message
itself cannot be trusted in case of the

149
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,840
values that say the user right

150
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:27,940
what do you think about notification ok
that's why I think so I'm gonna say I'm

151
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,260
a fan of codification because it was you
have to understand the purpose of

152
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,900
education it's has to make more
difficult more time consuming more

153
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,579
resource consuming to attack a roadside
to analyze to understand what's going on

154
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:51,070
in here having the site we have
signatures so what we're looking for and

155
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,290
the reasoning engine how actually it
works

156
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,280
embedded on the client site so I think
we have to protect it

157
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:05,220
we have to make it hard to understand
the cult itself and also hiding in plain

158
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,460
sight also to embed in some real
JavaScript inside the application in

159
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:18,590
case of codification we found i dont
didn't escape cold at all or it was

160
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:26,939
easily to use it to buy possible but
still some applications if you look into

161
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:32,320
the transcripts related therefore skated
got it was quite easy to spot because it

162
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,120
was different

163
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,939
all of the rest of the card was not
obligated small parts was out that's

164
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:46,860
what interested us there so simple
obfuscation some pics and coding based

165
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,240
64 strengths

166
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:56,820
quite easily to the culture just what we
recommend in case of obligation is to

167
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,840
use multiple JavaScript obfuscation
taking that whilst

168
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:08,209
scripts and to change them for example
some of the solutions we generated each

169
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:14,520
time the JavaScript which was which were
taught it to analyze this anthem out of

170
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,680
26 for signatures was donated each every
time the page was loaded so you could

171
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,700
use the interchange

172
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,090
obfuscation techniques to make it hard
to understand and make it how to

173
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:39,990
automate their frustration of course how
to be there are speaking about

174
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,340
signatures we found two approaches
signatures server side and plain sight

175
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:52,889
how does the initial server-side works
basically user requests that some sites

176
00:18:52,890 --> 00:19:00,810
you navigate to his banking site and he
got old ahd and I'll JavaScript CSS

177
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:10,350
files also he got this detection script
which signatures were really regular

178
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:20,300
expressions we extract parts of the
rendered HTML site and those parts store

179
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:28,240
struck months were sent back to allies
to the server so here the signatures may

180
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,690
be there weren't easy to see what some
of some of the analysis was done on the

181
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:39,960
server side but still we knew we now
which parts of the website where I sit

182
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:48,810
here and second approach was signatures
client site so they must be for

183
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:57,470
navigators and got all the stuff of HTML
JavaScript CSS stuff in it and also our

184
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:09,420
pilot action script and he got
signatures and battered US also in the

185
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:16,960
script which are what is signatures it
was some concern strength functions

186
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,960
which were the JavaScript related to
signature were looking for

187
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:30,500
your for example window object some
constant financial names variable names

188
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,680
sometimes also the type of the object
related to given name was also checked

189
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:44,410
and then signatures were analyzed and
the responses were sent back to the

190
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:51,470
server so actually doing as I said
before the obfuscation we are able to

191
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:57,380
see really which signatures which
JavaScript objects related to Web

192
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,580
injects

193
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:09,360
applications under my arm and was
looking for one other thing there are

194
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,979
two approach because here we have one
crisis to crisis in Italy industry

195
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:21,000
interests sorry initialization face when
he started and then the reporting face

196
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,890
when results are sent back to the server
so we had two phases actually and you

197
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,320
could either ask about that blocked the
first think the initialization and

198
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,760
secondly you can also manipulate what
was sent back to the server and one of

199
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:48,620
solutions we just thought it was like
this something there was an error of my

200
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:56,169
numbers and each signature practices
related to changing or not depending on

201
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:02,030
if the mother was found are not changing
that one of dole's in disarray and then

202
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:08,710
this area was sent back to the server so
basically we had if there is there were

203
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:14,060
no matter who were present on the
machine we had actual results

204
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:21,110
peres was sent back to the server as it
was sent to the browser so nonetheless

205
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:26,389
we had minor or not we could also folks
that we are clear message to the server

206
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,040
and send it back so

207
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:38,100
case of client-side signatures now
moving to the last part of our talk to

208
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:45,949
conclusions we divided into two groups
for potential buyers of such solutions

209
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:51,610
we think it's good approach to have to
boot or to buy this kind of social

210
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,870
because I think in the end user will get
them are under station so we have to

211
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,729
somehow protected business and this is
OK in case of buying don't believe and

212
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:09,570
military great technology dollars into
marketing bullshit ask for teachers how

213
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,970
it works to how it really works

214
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,480
request also left Imani our
infrastructure try to see how easily it

215
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,230
will marry into your existing web
applications into your existing

216
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:30,880
monitoring solution this is also such
solutions while layer of defense you

217
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,360
cannot forget you have to have strategy
right you have to have people watching

218
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,979
it what is also most importantly in such
a solution I think not them our

219
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:46,300
detection right which it holds but I
think one of the most important thing is

220
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:53,980
how weak it is social kind of response
to an ongoing malware attacks which it

221
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,290
doesn't stop at this very moment how
quickly I chose two nations can be

222
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:03,300
deployed to stop something which is
hurting you are really very moment okay

223
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,879
so also we think it's important to
gather knowledge insight have not only

224
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,480
have it but I understand how it works to
improve ourselves and to trust but

225
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:22,950
verify right you have to trust it works
but trying to check ok going to the

226
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:32,370
vendors I would like to second at all
the vendors we found our we are reported

227
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,449
to them and

228
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:40,409
we did it in a responsible discussion
matter so as I said before this is good

229
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:45,230
pass to build such lessons but still
have to remember that we have processor

230
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:52,740
servers HTTP HTML Javascript and all the
good and bad which comes with it so

231
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,429
remember . remember how JavaScript work
remember pluses and minuses of

232
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:05,669
codification think about your
architecture try to be one step before

233
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:14,909
your potential attackers what's next

234
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:21,669
actually we've finished allow some time
ago a paper which we can analyze the

235
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:27,100
sect help you both a solution like this
one if the intercepts police find us we

236
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,549
are here at the conference site or stand
you can write an email tweet it to us

237
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:40,100
wherever however I approached us however
you wish now questions if you have any I

238
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:47,659
don't see hands because of the light

239
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,430
just one maybe I was like yes please

240
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,210
quick question how reliable is it to
detect signatures like if I drink a

241
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,610
redbull is my signature of how use my
online banking very different if I'm

242
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,490
tired too drunk whatever else does that
bullet that's done using online banking

243
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:17,990
now I'm so fortunate to have to use it I
prefer online banking career instead of

244
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:26,530
going to the bank office in case of a
user secure a note I think most of the

245
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:34,750
time we are secure right so let's say it
will work

246
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:41,690
future of work of anti-malware work and
actually malware detection like

247
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,400
everything else in to the web

248
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,870
everything in the browser like some time
ago you had stand along clients with

249
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,810
banking and so on that were you actually
everything is in the web so so you have

250
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:04,830
to trust these solutions or maybe create
yours but there

251
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:13,519
question how if you should also mean
from your test how many times can detect

252
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,970
malware let's talk about tire and some
other mother which know if you're

253
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,730
talking about the rates of detection

254
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,490
we don't have like an arsenal of all my
were created actually if you want to get

255
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,610
infected by a specific model were
targeted for specific bank it's not very

256
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:40,570
easy you don't go to google and type in
fact me with the use targeted to let's

257
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,720
say ABC bank it's it's not so easy with
we don't have an arsenal of my work

258
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,450
actually I have to say we are not
strictly my were researchers we do not

259
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,470
do I could deep reverse engineering and
so on

260
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:03,200
most of this war is actually web
penetration test because it is a web web

261
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,830
solution yes it's another piece of
software which is outta to your web

262
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,840
application

263
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,470
e-banking web application which could
still have her abilities but still no

264
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,960
but section rates for lower is actually
one hundred percent for DS model where

265
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,950
four weeks until our solution have two
signatures right looks like a nineteen

266
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,250
viruses and efficient yeah well
sometimes it covers the nineties the

267
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:35,620
other solution gets 99 well yeah this is
pretty good I wanted to antivirus right

268
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:41,768
it's as good as is and is very moment
would be a bank would you advise me to

269
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:46,320
invest in such technologies or find some
different alternatives in order to

270
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,889
secure my client's yeah well that's
that's a question if you are buying

271
00:28:52,889 --> 00:29:05,418
queef funds which can actually more like
software-as-a-service we choose which is

272
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,380
this kind of solution or you want to
create your your own crew your own team

273
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,860
working on lower actually in our opinion
I think like a small team of five people

274
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,189
or or maybe more

275
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,630
is enough to do all this work by the
bank itself

276
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:31,929
okay thank you for like two outs to my
colleague said I think and building an

277
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:38,630
in-house onto milos solutions could have
one advantage I think if that same our

278
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:43,470
creators will start to targeting such as
solutions I think they will start with

279
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:49,389
something which is mainstream like which
has biggest market adoption and if you

280
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:54,740
have it anyhow I think you could be a
little bit safer because you did it your

281
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:01,279
all you have to say it's built on top of
your application right but there are

282
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:09,000
social icons like we've heard from from
one of our client that's if the model

283
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,419
where operate there are sore

284
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:17,720
see that these bank is protected by ABC
anti-malware solution they do not start

285
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,019
as they do not touch base because it's
too much work to them and they rather

286
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:36,119
attack smaller bank which does not have
the solution was just during this rising

287
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:43,459
prices just a useful to or just called
tool to analyze this we know it

288
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:51,580
sometimes it could just go out of your
mind just realizing such things actually

289
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:57,259
and it was as I said it was quite easy

290
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:03,769
was sometimes one or two techniques used
the script wasn't big enough to try to

291
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:08,340
write Santos right I have two plus a few
hours

292
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,158
knowing of course before application
techniques but because it wasn't long

293
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:18,200
script and it was quite is the office
Kate it took me awhile to get to the

294
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,480
meaning of the functions outside because
also their names were obligated but we

295
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:30,019
did it by hand I to let's say to check
some scenarios we actually create some

296
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:32,149
tools in case of it was

297
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:36,729
plugins to for example cut
communications or to modify the script

298
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:44,799
on the fly to reach repeats artists but
it was mostly by hand

299
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,970
well that's mostly because our
translation tests are mostly money while

300
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,620
we do not use mainly scanners and

301
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:02,059
automated tools we prefer manual testing
yeah of course of course scapegoat our

302
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:13,149
souls on the very first used his
beautiful

303
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:23,800
until to make it pretty low key right
that's not really make it look richer so

304
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,059
I could ask the full up pushing if you
assume that every user has a unique

305
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,770
pattern they pressed keys how many
spelling errors they make a move their

306
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:36,730
mouse could use a similar technique to
figure out whether someone else is using

307
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:42,220
my count they don't have the pattern of
how I use my computer and my devices

308
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,850
what happens now I feel like we've seen
some solution which is like for example

309
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:53,629
Google Copper Creek upjohn know it
measures some speed of plagues and and

310
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,240
so on

311
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,650
there are many new authentication metals
for the banking industry like voice

312
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:06,030
authentication we had a lot of fun
testing recently voice recognition

313
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:11,190
technology like my colleagues went crazy
when I was speaking all day long into

314
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,570
the bank ADCB lured me into the bank ABC
then there were also some twenty stories

315
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:24,860
like one of the option if the voice of
integration software was to ask the bank

316
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,240
how much money of guarding polish its

317
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:37,510
and it rhymes with how we are just so
much poverty there and it worked

318
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:45,400
yeah so I think I think I haven't seen
such solution which will indicate user

319
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,320
by

320
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,389
by measuring their behavior but maybe
it's the future I've I think right now

321
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:58,549
there are tools which allow you in case
of this solution which allows me to say

322
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:05,769
if there is a real user bar or a script
which do this automatically but still we

323
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:11,109
saw some cases when there was no
automated tool to extract for example

324
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,918
money

325
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:18,649
compromised account but there was some
operators number the real human which

326
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:24,359
was doing the transfer himself so in
case with a remote desktop yeah so in

327
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:33,899
case I'm not sure how r ya when I think
we were able to see something funny

328
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:42,060
during our analysis we found out that
because we lost this case wasn't polish

329
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:48,460
let's say institutions financial
institution and we found out one quite

330
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:55,510
easy to spot problem during our analysis
of our most of the users do not change

331
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:01,319
at least do not change the language to
English before they started making trust

332
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:06,020
and that speaker interests and it shows
only dole's accounts were compromised

333
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:20,300
change the first thing they did change
language to all right but quite obvious

334
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,730
another one

335
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:31,230
so would you prefer to recommend
behavior and analyzes

336
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,520
users actions and bank or just provide
something like that

337
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,670
clientless malware detection system you
had to choose one

338
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:53,400
we realized I was let's say skip to
waste solutions which right it we're

339
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,900
using signatures so actually we didn't
bypass any solution which were using

340
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:09,160
really use our which were doing down
there saying right so I think those

341
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,649
things can be good enough

342
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:17,700
like this is a good way to do it good
way to protect your business from the

343
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,149
mall where it will have to understand
the purpose of fun similar solution it

344
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:26,339
has to minimize the risk but do not
delete the risk right it won't stop

345
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:31,509
everything but in most cases it will
stop popular

346
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:44,000
my family against you or any other
questions

347
00:36:44,000 --> 00:37:03,520
factions fight with your thoughts of my
reduction of specific question to ask

348
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:10,240
because we do not provide such solution
but as we've seen its actually most 99%

349
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,459
of banking malware which is operating in
real now you know actually there was

350
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:27,589
some names took these names from one of
the vendor website

351
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:36,960
nice catch nice right there is some some
names but actually lowered the text

352
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:46,009
mechanism is as good as its signatures
so actually for most of signatures for

353
00:37:46,009 --> 00:38:03,579
most of operating in rio yeah I does
this software has some did you discover

354
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:09,339
it has some finding false positives so
it's too sensitive that is recognizing

355
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:27,440
the user are similar but this kind of
behavior one solution and it caught some

356
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,380
automated tools which were looking to
bank but they were not aware they would

357
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:38,900
some intermediary payment companies
weeds do not want to pay the fee for the

358
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,589
bank for gathering gathering
transactional data but they just log

359
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:47,349
into the bank by their own but the other
I don't think so

360
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:52,410
out to other one other thing is some of
the signatures were let's say it was

361
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:58,140
forgiven my family was set of signatures
to check for example dysfunction that

362
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:04,650
sanction those streets drinks of given
names and if all of this were filed then

363
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:11,469
the backend server set ok this user is
infected with ABC Family came in case of

364
00:39:11,469 --> 00:39:16,569
some of them were missing for example is
found two functions but only two strings

365
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:22,420
not free it generated some hours
something is not it was not red light

366
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,240
but it'll take a yellow so

367
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:35,359
it really didn't allege the right on
this particular one didn't hire 200 that

368
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,230
only when it was certain that given all
its present dissolution catch a

369
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:48,160
signature is like a function is a
function which does operate on the HTTP

370
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,470
request so sometimes it may happen that
on the bank website originated there is

371
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:59,700
a script which could be called by the by
this kind of solution actually vendors

372
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:06,189
of such solution analyze their website
the bank website before and create like

373
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,360
a targeted signatures in case of
signatures have to be careful because

374
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,780
for example the user also can the
developers of the web application can

375
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,700
put some names into its a window object
from global financial names which would

376
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:26,618
collide with your signatures right and
still having given a less a base 64 D

377
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:32,710
cult doesn't mean you have mild or maybe
the users developers develop deflection

378
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:37,470
for good reason right but still have to
protect you have to test it against pure

379
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:43,250
clean with application to call a false
positive example

380
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:53,690
in one bank there was a situation where
but like a liking to the Firefox I think

381
00:40:53,690 --> 00:41:00,460
or or chrome injected some codes into
the banking website I think one of the

382
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,230
solution properties as well being
checked but it's it was not because it

383
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:16,130
was an original web browser plugging

384
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:21,070
ok so thank you very much and you should
get the follow-up paper or just leave

385
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,940
your business card or send us an email
thanks
