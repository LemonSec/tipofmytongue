1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,029
ok so hello everyone my name is gonna be
cold wind to this is actually more an

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,360
announcement of Electr thank you for
coming I'm from the drug sector CDF team

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,100
and this year we happily organizing the
CTF at confidence and is ranked on city

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,300
Ave time to talk city are four teams and
many great teams have already arrived

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,890
but the city efforts open for anyone to
participate now represents an

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,259
information so first of all if you
actually never played a city of Baguio

7
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,210
somewhat curious of what's going on but
our city official called jeopardy style

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:44,360
lesbians that there'll be twenty to
thirty challengers both from simple easy

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,300
ones too

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,459
rather demanding and how to challengers
from these categories which are web

11
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,800
security which is quite obvious as
low-level exploitation so if you like

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,030
buffer overflows that is your category
then cryptography are actually tripped

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,810
on our stories you might get some and
coded message or you might get some

14
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,189
wrongly implemented algorithm and an
encoded message and you would have to

15
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:19,548
break the crypto and get a message back
now thousands something on auto lenders

16
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:26,220
I do hope they will not be a bother to
you because city of players know about

17
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,298
various groups together and were as bad
signal so we hope this is a good one

18
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,799
we have some 400 challengers quite out
of rivers and during telander so if

19
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,049
you're into reverse engineering he will
have a lot of fun we also have one or

20
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:46,390
two networking to understand we had we
have a harder task which is super

21
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,619
awesome that will be launched today I
think about 3 p.m. so be sure to check

22
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:57,270
it out now of course not all cylinders
are opened at the beginning at the

23
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,920
beginning to reopen on the issue and
then during the time of the city yes

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:08,330
everything will be well consecutive is
opened now our city is a team-based ETF

25
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,160
meaning you play in teams of course

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,549
there is a limit for players per team
and every service is the upper limit

27
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,580
just to be sure if you want to play
alone no problem at all of the players

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:29,800
must be at confidence to participate by
the way if you do not want to play but
