1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,750
very high wind advisory was your evening
only air and my presentations about sign

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:14,420
so it's about time we started this is
so-called defensive time I'll TSOL me

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,960
talking mostly about defense and my
presentation is very differentiated so

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,000
right from the start I drop on social
distribution I even posted a small

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,330
college advice or I can see that this is
open everyday me know others thank you

6
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:49,760
for the full room after actually so
because they wanted to be moving because

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,940
this is about time and maybe does it
stop working care the photos are losing

8
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,089
yeah we'll do i mean John McCrae one set
famous vendor so this is because of

9
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:09,350
certain bullet in your head least of
security solutions that you have to work

10
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,699
on again and again and again and again
and again so this time look down

11
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,619
Thursday and it's a song birds marriage
I my sentences to my wife and kids but

12
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,500
the heirs of you in colors on the
information security productivity line

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:36,130
is very rarely exciting requires
continuous deepening of knowledge

14
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,420
experience skills leading to the
superhuman effort to distinguish why one

15
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:49,450
day at work from the other ear so what
should we do as defenders maybe we'll

16
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:55,579
just pack attackers here so there is
even this kind of strategy investable

17
00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:00,779
for example how can check yes or maybe
taking down but that's offensive

18
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,340
security yeah

19
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:13,330
maybe we should do just like John McCrae
maybe it will lead us somewhere else

20
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,690
like we talked in France he was first
criminal but then he appears to be

21
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,220
starting the criminal police in france
here there is Frank Abagnale career from

22
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,580
experts order to experts in for jury yet
and maybe indians' of the spot we will

23
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:38,709
do time in prison by kevin Mitnick those
cybersecurity do us from last century

24
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,290
leave stall on kevin Mitnick tsutomo
shimumora

25
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,970
it was more like saddam was a vocal
business giving meeting consists of vs

26
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,390
Marquez has here so it's like one of the
ones to believe but I think that this is

27
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,540
not one on once treatable anymore those
comparisons to for example sites via

28
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:05,319
when one guys fighting another guy I
think this is more and more about the

29
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:13,940
the team played because what happens
when we will start to play according to

30
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,049
the regulations the air for every
possession le every game

31
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:24,650
sides by changes of them poor overtimes
long season strategies maybe even finals

32
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:32,829
here we are getting his security dude
just another metaphor here so basketball

33
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:38,519
ruslan possible metaphor area but I will
be sick of this world of metal horse how

34
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,780
to make those button but for small
concrete here I don't know if you know

35
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:51,859
what I meant good mate of informal
schemes and cool yeah and when we are

36
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:58,419
talking about kids on cool dance career
yeah we know that they had so no wonder

37
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:04,310
this is leading expert in building
biggest HP Systems HDS abbreviations

38
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,850
from human this place is great for me
deliberates so we can see that

39
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,359
it's sometimes hard to distinguish
distinguish fact from fiction yet we are

40
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,180
questioned questioning who is attacking
who's defending is this really about

41
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,010
this one on ones through ball when you
have this change alternatives rules like

42
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:33,670
no blood no foul yeah I think that in
the end when I would like to give you a

43
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,310
movie the interview but from the
perspective of this ataxia do we have

44
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,160
enormous how was it was it worked out
yet what is the time like it was trying

45
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,840
to do it it was like starting 2015 he
wasn't billion and she had talked about

46
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,760
this but it appears it's not so easy to
to talk about security from this

47
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,070
perspective here the guy doesn't stop
talking previously about sock he was

48
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:08,540
trying to get into this level of how to
say it even obstruction yeah for example

49
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,830
for example what is the plausible time
spent talking about most of all time

50
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:21,150
here for for some attack stock set for
release open at the same time here so

51
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,109
they were just trying to make it quick

52
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,850
this is the assumption of one of the
guys you can find the full article in

53
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:36,030
the URL apt 36 possibly working on
shifts please enter your attention cult

54
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,599
using to support him

55
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,040
so this perspective as global
perspective of security that we are

56
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,480
maybe sometimes tired of leads to this

57
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:00,250
24 7 security operations here for so
must watch while so must sleep so runs

58
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,310
the world away

59
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:07,120
hamlets shakespeare but this time
management yeah he's obviously a

60
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,200
sometimes sometimes someone is trying to
do it with us here we have this working

61
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,479
time productivity time measured in
fractions of the second year for example

62
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,860
make sure maybe someone was just making
them and someone just counted that it

63
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,920
was not fast enough maybe we should do
something more in the meantime 22

64
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:35,650
priests are managers here or other times
it will be all returned time to time

65
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,700
tracking software yet maybe we should
join danger chief in the park time of

66
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,890
free time like the one from cyber army
that we are trying to build there was a

67
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:50,580
talk about this maybe this is a good
idea to spend your free time that you

68
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,060
are not working as a company and yes we
have creative people yes it's not

69
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,120
visible on the slide but there are
artists and they are they were actually

70
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,390
from different parts of day and night
but in the end we are humans we are not

71
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:16,260
all sent bats just don't sleep at night
and do your thing here but maybe if you

72
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,230
are not a cure and your choices between
attacking systems to get some money or

73
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:28,020
maybe making shoes you would choose yeah

74
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:35,680
probably where some of you are right now
where it's called where he speak up

75
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,330
where r memory dumps here

76
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:46,099
dismayed at work he asked me once you're
talking about later eight what exactly

77
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:53,020
it was about give me something concrete
or maybe you think I'm stupid yeah so

78
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,479
this underlying implicit assumption that
I failed was easy to reading between

79
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:05,620
lines we insecurity we are almost always
trying to track the US concrete's thinks

80
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:11,630
here but in my opinion there is less and
less concrete on this level of

81
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,310
obstructions here but this is talk about
time we can do little time travel like

82
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:23,729
their heroes Superman we will go back in
time I was stopped my talk again but now

83
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:33,110
there will be different subtitle yes you
know Stephen Hawking famous physicist he

84
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,550
wrote this famous a brief history of
time book Yahoo a few things that

85
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:44,899
Stephen Hawking is more appropriate
person to talk about time from physical

86
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:52,470
security police reserve em up no one
uses raising canes ok so maybe there's

87
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,570
another question who of your themes that
he was joined confidence 2015 in Krakow

88
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,970
plans to talk about time and security
but there is one ruled this is not part

89
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,040
of city of competition the ethno Hawking
Hawking come out so please don't do it

90
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,719
here I think that maybe some of you will
be able to do it and this is my quick

91
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,230
solution ideally Ellicott City I call it
abstract concrete knowledge

92
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,730
intersubjective fury so abbreviation for
women or men yeah it's looks a little

93
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:35,040
bit like some some caution of pack of
cigarettes or smokes here so you can

94
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,000
quit smoking just trying to quit smoking
here

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but I think that we are on different
levels with so many things and ideas

96
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,720
about seeing send things that came from
ideas here you can be especially someone

97
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,810
else security but you can just 42
different area and in the end we just we

98
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:02,280
are just trying to build this overall
abstract militia and why this is

99
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:10,390
important here because we have different
feel so hot rolled here we got

100
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,280
technology yes it's it's obviously a
week but we have different realms like

101
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,640
business law politics and they are here
for hundreds of years so they are just

102
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,819
people to make talks like that on this
global level maybe we are leaving in the

103
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,670
realm of World of Warcraft spied by then
the same yeah so Indiana conceptually

104
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:37,339
information security is on the incorrect
incomplete incomplete sorry inconsistent

105
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:43,410
for cars like which item in the dark
ages to quote a famous don t Parker talk

106
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,650
maybe like eight hundreds views on
YouTube

107
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,430
yeah so if we will not do it

108
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,770
business we will do it and there is
there are great examples from people

109
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,800
that are trying to represent both sides
of their

110
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,349
decide on the side mirror area there is
a nice talk about so-called timing

111
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,839
attacks from cows Computer Club
conference and there are at least two

112
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,980
ways to fight this type of attacks we
can fix our coat it's pretty obvious

113
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,120
here we are mostly doing it here so to
avoid such anger if we don't like

114
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,720
anybody let us know if the user is in
our database we should do always the

115
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,690
same thing doesn't matter if someone is
or is not in the database but different

116
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:45,250
solution is using pretty sophisticated
statistics yeah so this guy he's a PhD

117
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,640
from academia and he was just

118
00:11:48,640 --> 00:12:01,270
I don't know just to be sorry about
state of the art research papers from

119
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:07,970
defenders about how to defend our
companies not using just watching do you

120
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,420
really believe that this and other
vulnerabilities that leads to another

121
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,660
party about securities is the greatest
one there was a chance on my previous

122
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:25,270
slight dissent another metaphor yes
because on the next level of abstraction

123
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:31,870
we are getting drinks more family area
like to join us here on Second Polish so

124
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:38,610
is making the donuts about sugar is
holding a particular notice a microchip

125
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,310
so we really believe that in the future

126
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:51,849
solutions Michael solutions will be able
to deposit them so there are some ideas

127
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:59,170
about connecting those two worlds this
very low-level and high-level insecurity

128
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:05,930
for example sticks but Steve seems like
there are a couple of cool dudes that

129
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,430
are just figuring out how to speaking
sticks but we are mostly using the

130
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,469
natural language and there is a good
resource from mr Flinstone Klein he

131
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,700
wrote a book about sign language so this
is book wrote in Broughton in English

132
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,190
from the German guy about different
languages and perception of time in

133
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,940
those languages radio will be my talk
you can already hear from my grammar

134
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,660
mistakes that I am NOT a native speaker
yes all long translations and cars from

135
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,500
appearing my talk yet so we are thinking
most about security in another language

136
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:52,250
and the talk about time I think that
makes this need for proper language

137
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:58,510
clean from the dearth of everyday life
more obvious so this is example

138
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,200
definition you have extra padding
definitions insulated from Polish

139
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:12,060
created by huge and he have to say the
other time he's at least four minutes

140
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:20,739
here so to try to combine this just
definitions of security we can just

141
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:28,540
imagine the moment exact date time point
he's thinking about time for your time

142
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,920
segment time interval use process like
thinking about this time the duration

143
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,589
delaying tease password expiration time
like stink about style and all-embracing

144
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:45,660
time period unlimited time line is like
time in the perspective of the cloud

145
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,800
solutions and distributed systems so
after the DMV office this kind of least

146
00:14:51,800 --> 00:15:00,469
from the world of security we gots time
how how long are computers can be of

147
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,350
service due time how long should it
boots to to make the dura massive the

148
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,210
image here that we know that maybe there
is something wrong with the computer in

149
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,340
the harbor on may be infected by
malicious software but and here's a list

150
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,110
of terms used in security like that we
can get into things like cheat sheet yes

151
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:29,380
this is very unclear work using can
depends on their counter in CPU it may

152
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,110
differ among different platforms so

153
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:41,310
maybe we need more formal definitions
here this guy just died from Columbia

154
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:48,849
University and she wrote a book like
hundreds of page hundreds of pages about

155
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,490
time and he was trying to formalize the
idea about what this time

156
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,380
combining three worlds here so wild one
warrant was world of mathematics sets

157
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,700
theory and that there was no G
definition by abstraction and the third

158
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:10,769
one will was physics so special and
general theory of relativity and

159
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:20,579
thirteen hundred copies so it's not how
important do you really like redux

160
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:26,319
dispose of the people here that people
do things that are popular will give our

161
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,519
answers here this is not even digitize
in any form in the Internet

162
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,310
yes so maybe we should only read
articles that are enough for the lunch

163
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:45,689
break and security to know exactly how
to fight different threats or defense so

164
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:51,899
there was this assumption seer those
assumptions least in the definition of

165
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:59,990
and he wrote something like time and its
properties exists objectively so this is

166
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:05,559
very root here but we will try to talk
about time in the physics perspective

167
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:11,470
here so it's obvious we go to from
Parmenides that there is no change and

168
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:18,939
all time then Newton classical physics
where there is absolute time then mark

169
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:24,540
relativity but this is version 1.0 about
relativity and then Einstein's

170
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,559
relativity combined with mathematicians
from Russia Minkowski spacetime Mia

171
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:35,928
indians' it appears that time according
to Jim barber

172
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:41,890
most contemporary social time in physics
thing here

173
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:47,140
she's killing time literally so he told
you he will tell you that we are only up

174
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,580
serving two completely different from
those that are moving into space and

175
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,379
there was no connection between them yet
we learned that the question and cooling

176
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,130
heat with the fencing in Pretoria will
not change your feeling that this is

177
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:07,190
some kind of the smoker yes some kind of
washing bands universe and in the end he

178
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,600
even told you that you are thinking
about this time in like like this

179
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,270
classic time timeline

180
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:24,960
the same time there were no problem
maybe I should stop my talking here

181
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,980
because there is no time so what am I
talking about but there's always

182
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,360
technological part of the problem

183
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:42,560
time in technology clocks but what clock
no I mean there may be some used the

184
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:50,889
first close view of the Sun in summer it
is smoke there is no night and day so I

185
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:56,060
think that the invention of time was not
from from the area from the perspective

186
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:03,419
so we got this does sound clorox sounds
close water clocks clocks can you call

187
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,380
one with pendulum with wheel with
temperature compensation yet but in the

188
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,540
end we we are in the 21st century so we
are thinking mostly about quartz clocks

189
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:17,740
electronic locks like the one from one
in my kitchen but these are tears up

190
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:27,350
when there is no power it will be rested
212 and function in function my kitchen

191
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:35,330
will be not working here so it is that
the DRS sorry for this function but this

192
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,810
is pretty similar to Example personal
computer yet what if there is no CMOS

193
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,260
battery

194
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,680
there will be a research and you will
have call from one of your client's and

195
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,970
he will tell you that

196
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,870
internet is not working and after the
legal charity will notice does what he

197
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:58,320
means by Internet these HTTPS connection
to Google and it's enough to have time

198
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,889
around three months

199
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,340
present time to to make it work again
but maybe she should use something like

200
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,800
ATP and ADP sorry but NTP server on
Windows platform system it like that

201
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,680
depends on the registry configuration it
will not synchronize when there is more

202
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:27,330
than 15 hours difference so if this is a
computer in organization that is using

203
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,810
Active Directory and Kerberos protocol
it will be a problem because it's enough

204
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:37,820
by default five minutes to make Kerberos
not work but our organization and our

205
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,850
time if there is a problem with time
then there is a problem with time on

206
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:49,610
every computer service not a problem but
defense because for example BKI

207
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:54,770
implementations for services that we are
using outside of our organizations are

208
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,400
using time stamps as well so the answer
me are getting into most popular way of

209
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,280
managing time in distributed systems and
EP it was created by David Mills it is

210
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:17,180
David Mills lifetime project thirty
years from 1995 and NDP in 0:24 that was

211
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:24,070
altered by by different guys and I think
that this this equation that we are

212
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,580
seeing in the middle of the screen

213
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:33,179
this is the only thing that survived
loss to two years so it's changed

214
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,060
completely

215
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:41,350
there are things like encryption 1394
but does your organization use NTP for

216
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:46,860
and encryption please check it and
there's also a definition section yet

217
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,199
time scale is a frame of reference were
time is express as the value of multiple

218
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,260
increasing binary counter return

219
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:00,660
indefinite number of bits they are
figuring out a way to overcome death

220
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:08,410
2036 problem and they just invented
so-called nter so altered after 2036

221
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,530
that will be next year on the next year
out then the next year oh yes we are

222
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,600
thinking about timing perspective of
hundreds maybe thousands of years here

223
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:29,230
so we will go to the strap of Service
here and there is the highest rate of 60

224
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:36,990
strata and those diseases strata Tyrese
Toni clock here this is invention of new

225
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:46,780
yes I made in the fifties atomic clock
but there were some place with time made

226
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:52,470
by hawkers and this confusion that if
you have only one clock it is not a

227
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:58,130
problem but we should have at least two
clocks you have to know which one of

228
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:05,410
them is showing the rights time
definition of the seconds from 1967 the

229
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:11,410
duration of over 9000 soft erudition
corresponding to the transition between

230
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:17,550
the two hyperfine levels of the ground
state of the season 1 33 items and after

231
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:22,450
22 years dangerous other this sentence
that it refers to assisi Martin much

232
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,890
rest of the temperature of zero ok so
thirty years in physics it's nothing

233
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:34,550
it's nothing here but insecurity I think
enough to make a little bit confusion

234
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:40,510
but we are not on this level of sound
anymore so we are not about us some in

235
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:46,379
time we are thinking in the perspective
of technology so atomic clocks is too

236
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:53,430
strong so it appears that there is this
international atomic time but for civil

237
00:23:53,430 --> 00:24:01,750
time there is UTC from our systems and
UTC have things like 30 seconds to quote

238
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,509
most of us every time we have fully

239
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:11,839
seconds we find something and in the end
it is there is huge compared to

240
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:18,789
so-called solar time so in the end we
are just about rotation of the of the

241
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:25,669
earth to compared to some so-called
static stars so leave seconds two times

242
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:37,969
a year and when we are comparing those
clocks clocks we are using things like

243
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:44,609
to wait I'm transfer using a satellite
is there any encryption involved so it

244
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:55,259
appears that the indians' time he's all
about physical area so is it secure it

245
00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:02,479
depends mostly on fewer optimist or a
pessimist I will try to be rarely see if

246
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:08,149
this is all about physical layer so
every encryption without some additional

247
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:13,069
latency and we want to avoid this we
want to make our time more and more

248
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:23,719
precise maybe in the end we want to make
the timescale equal to this season so

249
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:29,319
are there any things faster than the
speed of light so I know there are no

250
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:35,699
detectable seems there are things that
are faster and we can detect them for

251
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:44,919
example by using it wasn't long way from
time transfer for example Dec F 77 from

252
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,879
frontcourt popular in Germany and Europe
is it secure once again there is a

253
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:55,349
resource in the Internet and it appears
that you're sold soldiering skills sent

254
00:25:55,349 --> 00:26:03,799
just determination and law are only
obstacles to make everyone in your area

255
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:11,760
wake up two hours later and finally get
some proper rest

256
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:24,690
important because I'm just asking you
for this business extension into

257
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,710
security so-called risk assessment yes
this is a great idea how we can for

258
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:37,270
example count money after black unlike
in Turkey so we wish is there any amount

259
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:45,510
of money that is enough to two counts or
around our financial problems about

260
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,540
outrageous like that so I think that
time is something that we can measure

261
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:56,170
yet time as a service it's not science
fiction this is done by by Denise the

262
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:00,980
National Institute of Standards and
Technology in USA I was trying to ask if

263
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,510
our laboratory laboratory of times doing
things like that but they didn't answer

264
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:11,180
so it is to make everything about
real-time yeah we are using those

265
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:17,130
algorithms no one is buying the stock
market using mouse anymore yet it's

266
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:22,700
might be made by the Ultimates there is
a great great talk about the song that I

267
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:29,320
encourage you to look at that and after
this financial crisis in 2007 there were

268
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,500
ideas like making time banks where
people can jurors show services between

269
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,430
them and every hour spent on making
service to someone else worst orders in

270
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:46,370
there you can hike their tax system this
way because taxation systems are not

271
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:53,139
property tax docs are time maybe it will
change in the future yet so making the

272
00:27:53,140 --> 00:28:01,730
simple I'm not I'm not doing it may be
too often but this is all about money

273
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,920
yet but this is hard to discuss about
foreign money it's almost like oxymoron

274
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,470
we are trying to avoid latency and
jitter that everyone he doesn't matter

275
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:18,580
how far he's from the system that is
making the money he have the same chance

276
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,990
to buy some pilots

277
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:29,790
actions at the same time here and this
these documents is a great because there

278
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:36,330
is state of the art compared to current
problems in distributed systems

279
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:43,960
internals of things and technologies
that are the future technologies here so

280
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:51,800
I love systems final clout sorry I'm
system's timezone out so we should maybe

281
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:58,659
call club's award what it was biking
today set time showing because maybe

282
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:03,740
some marketing genius with we lose his
job but we will be more that the

283
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:12,559
security will be more visible because
there is logic clock yeah we are not

284
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,710
tight physical clocks we can do logic in
in the way that systems are working and

285
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:28,620
just logic like imports timestamps can
just a line offense in the sequence that

286
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,669
we are trying to implement maybe
something will happen

287
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:38,110
couple of seconds before I'm something
couple of minutes seconds after but he

288
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,439
truly shouldn't be this way so we can
just try to fix it but in the end it

289
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,140
will be a time cause we will cost some
time and we are not interested in making

290
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,250
our systems less real time because what
is this real time really

291
00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:01,429
and there are problems seem single point
of failure I am I was talking about the

292
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:06,710
lib seconds this is about to leave they
bark there is great post mortem returned

293
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:12,670
by Microsoft about this issue 13 hours
their cloud solution was not working

294
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:20,110
because of time problems here so keep
second two times every year

295
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:27,300
leave they back once in the four-year
and Millennium box maybe once

296
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,119
millennium yeah there is a lot to to
search

297
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:40,809
in there so how to do the large-scale
difference here we can always laugh like

298
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:48,449
drama crazy laughing I'm not trying to
attack a good job to show us where is

299
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:56,829
the floor but I don't want to maybe
protect her or other capital of those

300
00:30:56,829 --> 00:31:02,688
solutions here that Joey smiling hard
here but in the end what is less for us

301
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:10,099
just try to do this time travel to the
moment when there was an attack what is

302
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:17,149
left for us if even if we are trying to
analyze my were like Robert ich the time

303
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:22,119
consumption can be an obstacle and he
just like hundreds of gigabytes you have

304
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:30,059
to have like 25 mins to even soldiers
data so yes this is about obstruction we

305
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:34,928
are looking at security locks it is not
working very well maybe maybe should be

306
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:43,699
should be about capturing the pickup
drove last but he proposed even this you

307
00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:47,769
stop here that we should should agree
but speaker so I think that there will

308
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:55,689
be more suicides in security and how
exactly do you copy data from our

309
00:31:55,689 --> 00:32:00,529
network CEOs from from like middle of
endpoints so it's like Blackhearts

310
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:06,339
shooting in the western movie 21 million
bottles with the gun yes you see it's

311
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:12,229
easy to talk it's maybe not the most
easy way in the world but you can attack

312
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:17,939
one of million in financing vehicle
registration and in the fraction of the

313
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:26,409
seconds more than CPU process amount of
data enough to view Google Data Center

314
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:33,219
so maybe we should should capture from
my smartphone data in the Google Data

315
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:39,680
Center then analyzed if there was any
threat in the end we have to have

316
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,690
abstract ideas about what we are doing
in large-scale securely security this

317
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:55,270
this photo on the left is from made by
parents mark and liquid physicist sounds

318
00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:03,610
like speed of the bullet from from those
waves here but in the end he will not

319
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:11,520
tell you who who should the bullet here
why shoot from where

320
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,160
and things like that so if you are at
the crime scene like confidence

321
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,900
conference it's like regular crime scene
yet there is a lot more questions to ask

322
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:28,330
them the speed of the bullet or that how
about what is working here yet this is

323
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:37,939
important but but this is not enough

324
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:43,590
involving I'm just I'm just about the
truth yet what we are doing security

325
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,820
maybe it's like you just saw the others
dali picture someone was stating that

326
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,720
this is about special theory of
relativity but in the end it appears

327
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:00,940
that it was about coming back she's
melting in the Sun so are we about

328
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:11,170
science of cyber or maybe are hawking or
about just compliance fiction so we can

329
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:19,170
do this shortcut and maybe this is about
science fiction so we made this travel

330
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:23,550
back in time and now to avoid the time
paradox maybe we should go far in the

331
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:31,840
future so this is good definition
because from this perspective every

332
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,320
life-time projects in security looks
like temporary 46 yeah condition by

333
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,840
knowledge and social efficiency waste to
achieve its goals all their goals often

334
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,640
unwanted are appearing and this is
typical here so we are building our

335
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,509
technology and we are trying to
implement security technology and are

336
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,260
ready

337
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,610
challenging looking into the future

338
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:05,810
things like this timeline when you can
just combined scene starts someone was

339
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:11,220
predicting things that were actually
implemented and this is more and more

340
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,879
filled with actual solutions that came
from

341
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:22,950
sometimes crazy ideas so so things like
time paradox or time travel yeah we are

342
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:28,379
trying to do time travel back in time or
in some so-called back in time to

343
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:36,550
barking we are even comprise solutions
for example seem and we are going to

344
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:42,300
through those times oops we are trying
to analyze the same set of data once

345
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,110
again and there will be a new approach
and we will analyze it once again and

346
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:51,150
maybe after a moment we will know about
some vulnerability and we will analyze

347
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,570
it once again appeared that there is
some way to combine this level of

348
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,250
abstraction with this level of
competition in the laboratory

349
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:05,120
environment here it's not easy to do
like from the abstract data we have to

350
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:13,250
combine those two worlds of things like
what time zone scene from a movie so

351
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,830
there are a group of there is a group of
infantile trying to implement it in our

352
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,259
networks and when we will just stop
there

353
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,920
time for some detectives malicious
traffic you can just try to block it

354
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,770
the fraction of the second so maybe they
will manage to do it and what concerns

355
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:40,090
me when I'm thinking about the future is
mostly are cryptography because people

356
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:40,930
were seized

357
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:51,730
part time complexity in our ideas about
mathematics there was great news for

358
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,420
this kind of thinking about 36 from
previous guy that was talking about

359
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:04,550
trust boundaries of Physics Irie Irie
thinking that are three sixes it's ok is

360
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,180
there is no back in physics in Nigeria
because quantum is already der quantum

361
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,578
cryptography and we are trying to be fun
to computers in the end may be depressed

362
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:19,200
after cryptography is is good for for
this classic ideas about how to build

363
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,029
computers but not for the future there
are even models for now

364
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:29,190
mathematical and logical models like
infinite I'm drink machines I encourage

365
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:34,040
you to read about this this is mind
blowing stuff and time-lapse

366
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:40,089
cryptography so you can just unpacked
this time capsule in the future just to

367
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:49,400
store something that is security of
their rights time will come

368
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,700
inception attempts in my talk yes it's
obvious there was multiple inception of

369
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,740
times we were going deeper and deeper
yeah I think that defense might be cool

370
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:06,009
and it doesn't have to be nice at the
same time we have to build some some

371
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,980
idea about difference that is cool
because I know that it can be boring and

372
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:17,359
exhausting and I think it's harder than
attacking but if we don't want to work

373
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,660
with problems like that it will not be
solvable by some some marketing genius

374
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:29,680
dismissal sell another box and I think
we need to go deeper and deeper and

375
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,129
sometimes I get here just try to be
involved in things that are not obvious

376
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,299
right from the start

377
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:43,480
spend some time with time in your arias
of the Association I think that's maybe

378
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,180
two slots Millennium Park but then you
move marks and we can find something

379
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,549
related to time because we are more and
more involved in making our system for

380
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:52,210
real-time

381
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:58,380
and speeded up and fight and it's not
only about finding firefighting entropy

382
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:03,599
on city Ave competitions when there is a
Christian involved here because on this

383
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,490
micro level world is probably sick on
discussing of Physics level is

384
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:16,770
predictable and on D level off global
security I think it was probably sick

385
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:22,869
once again so it's not easy it's easier
to destroy something else something and

386
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:29,140
protected and deciding instance our off
time I think its obvious insecurity

387
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,879
world get from your boundaries of
ignorance here because I think that's

388
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,839
being around me are not stupid we are
ignorant CEO we don't know mentions does

389
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,200
why is this market approach we can be on
different levels of fitness indifference

390
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:50,089
ideas about how securities working comes
to submit this year and this balance

391
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:56,170
between figure out and consider out
sometimes you just have to figure out

392
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,770
some security solutions to protect the
environment and sometimes you can you

393
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:05,550
have to think outside of the box that
someone is selling try to figure out a

394
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:10,369
way that the books should be working and
it is not working right now but maybe it

395
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:17,109
will be working like that in the future
so why we should do it this way because

396
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:24,060
there is this confusion where write
letters and shit yo yes so it's all

397
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:31,710
about words hawk or hocker can come from
things like talking with our intellect

398
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,200
to solve problems

399
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:42,169
roughly chopping block us but in the
past it was also a person hired to do

400
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:47,450
the routine job if we will think about
that show that this is only routine shop

401
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:55,200
then maybe we are more about not being
cocky and snow hiking and those are two

402
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,169
go two serious about medicine because
there are some comparisons between

403
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,430
security and medicine so we can do it

404
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:09,319
like state of the art Dr House he's
doing it by some solutions from

405
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:15,920
companies that is providing it and
microsurgery even remote surgery so once

406
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,140
again in remote surgeries it's all about
timing comes time or you can just meet

407
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,420
that we are just starting this year so
we are more like this guy from 1919

408
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,900
century that is trying to develop some
procedure but mostly covered with blood

409
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:41,230
and people are dying here because maybe
hundreds of years before us and we will

410
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:50,230
maybe managed to do not attack life way
but to do it more properly you can be

411
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:57,250
better defender area do is just like the
old man this guy was crazy maybe even

412
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,980
but he make a difference
