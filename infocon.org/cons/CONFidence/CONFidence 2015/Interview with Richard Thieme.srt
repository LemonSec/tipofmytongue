8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,240
421 years almost 22 now

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,519
I have post just done speaking

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,620
in writing about the larger impact
technology and

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,239
on people on organizations and
geopolitical structures and everything

12
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,339
they know that your focus in on the
early June issues & technologies well

13
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:46,150
well the ghost two things have in common
but they have a lot in common

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,500
because lets the server technology
technology shapes the way people think

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,339
they usually notice it when a new
technology changes how they think

16
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:59,489
and then they forget it %uh you don't
communion say oh we're using the power

17
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:00,299
grid today

18
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:05,188
you just assume the lights go on a you
take for granted the technologies that

19
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,070
have become the background of your life

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,158
a but in but when the first introduced
they change everything about your life

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,189
including what it means to be human
being

22
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:17,158
including the cultural social and and
thought world's

23
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,409
the reading habit and it worked now
religion is one of those cultural and

24
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,299
social and thought worlds that we
inhabit

25
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,549
and I used to be an episcopal clergyman

26
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,590
I did that for sixteen years and in the
early 1980s

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,560
playing with an apple to computer I had
an insight into how

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,429
computing if you went the way I thought
it would would would change religion

29
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:43,390
and because I was in a religious
structure I began writing and speaking

30
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,039
to those

31
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:47,179
to those themes because a

32
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:51,749
who we think we are Hui think God is not
who got his butt who we think

33
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:55,020
God is up how we frame our religions

34
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,399
how we organize our dogmas and doctrines

35
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,740
all those who functions for technology

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,100
so that people don't usually recognize
how much

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,449
the current religions that we all
recognize all over them

38
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,910
a merged with writing in writing turned

39
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,530
flesh-and-blood human beings into text
and then we interacted with the text

40
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,709
that eliminated all other religions that
had developed in world cultures

41
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,459
well the printing press did something
similar and electronic communications is

42
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,060
doing something like that again it

43
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,910
so I saw that it was as big a newt issue
for religions as the printing press in

44
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,640
reading and even speech before had been

45
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,319
and so I begin addressing those issues
and the religious world

46
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,890
um bus it's hard is a little slow to
pick up a new innovative technologies

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,609
in other words yeah so I couldn't find

48
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,000
a a conversation about that and that's
why I left that

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,040
that career network um

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,829
not my commitments but Dec career in
order to speak and write full-time

51
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,730
about technology and its impacts not
only religion but all the other things

52
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,920
because the impacts are so are similar

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,119
they work the same way but they won

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,329
a help address in the early days i
helped

55
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:16,130
teachers businesspeople 'em security
workers

56
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,850
everyone understand the difference a
that was coming

57
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,380
as a result of this a huge revolution in
eighty

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,230
well that sounds very fascinating yeah
and what is the title of your speech

59
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,569
here at Comcast and what they're going
to speak to you know all those hikers

60
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:31,950
slight hug hug

61
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,798
I think this he picked when I think it
was called spy verses Bob versus by

62
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,450
that it was about information
information warfare in the information

63
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,738
space that we inhabit

64
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,519
and with the focus because of where we
are on how the

65
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,090
russians are currently doing such a good
job propaganda and mastering the

66
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,700
information speeds at saturating their
own people

67
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,988
and that required me to show how since
world war two

68
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,600
the that information space propaganda
disinformation misinformation

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,069
I is the water in which we all swim and
so

70
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:07,470
it the project understanding what's real
begins with understanding how the

71
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,770
structures have information and
communication altar

72
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,220
in can be manipulated to to make a big
difference so I tried to

73
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,920
keep it focused and and what was most
relevant because we're not that far from

74
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,560
Ukraine and Russia here

75
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,810
that and there you can hear the boots on
the ground almost

76
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,490
here exactly and them your ad

77
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,500
yet keep writer what was your last
publication about

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,440
less book I have a new novel called
phone coming out this year

79
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,830
but I'll talk about the wonderful was
issued a couple years ago it was a team

80
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,030
effort headed by make swords in Robert
poll on

81
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,239
I was called UFO's in government
historical inquiry

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,860
and it is working history it's in 65

83
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,370
university libraries including Basilan
all over the world

84
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,520
because it recognizes the only book on
this subject

85
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,010
that is thoroughly documented we have a
lot of footnotes

86
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,230
and they all point to primary documents
and it's about the government

87
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,190
and how over half a century the
government responded to the phenomena

88
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,920
a viewing photos up in in light of
national security concerns so we

89
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,230
map that from the 1940s nineteen
eighties using documents which the

90
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,380
research team has

91
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,010
understaffed over 50 years have love
burrowing

92
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,349
and digging into the subject and we stay
focused on the government because that

93
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,440
we can document

94
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,270
but because the government continued to
respond to UFO phenomena

95
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,620
and made decisions about how to handle
it in public

96
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,280
and how to handle it differently in
private up

97
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,000
we can speak about that with authority
we do not speak

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,310
about or speculate about the ultimate
nature

99
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,580
up what UFO's are because we don't know
and there are no documents that we can

100
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,260
point to

101
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,710
if they are they're written in

102
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,380
you know some Star Trek language yep

103
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,040
a so we stayed with what we could do
could say and that's why it's

104
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,690
written it's been recognized as the best
work history in the subject ever written

105
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,210
that sounds really interesting so I
think we can highly recommend that our

106
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:03,820
and

107
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:14,520
up yesterday indeed thank you alert

108
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:14,549
on
