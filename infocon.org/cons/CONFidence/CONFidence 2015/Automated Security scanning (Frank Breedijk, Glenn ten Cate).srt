1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
yeah like you said the afternoon

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,389
my name's Frank I'm security officer for
a company called Schubert realist and

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:16,880
the children how style to a white on
black so sorry for that I work as in

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,509
security now since 2000 officially and
the author of a tool called secular my

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,250
name is Glenn think I'm mission-critical
engineer at your work finish the

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,759
security duty air and I'm also the
author of the security knowledge

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,329
framework and today we want to talk to
you about automated phone durability

8
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,829
scanning automated security assessment
and and why why would you want to do

9
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,700
that why do we create a tool for it but
the tool was created it's partly out of

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,449
frustration I I really felt that the
tools I had did not fit what I needed to

11
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:58,250
do then I also got challenged by
somebody to make it better and that's

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,289
really always a good book button to push
at me and like I said I wanted to make

13
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:08,540
my life easier so I want to start off
with a little demonstration I want to

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,439
introduce two other fellows who may look
familiar but you may not know on your

15
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:20,320
left hand side we got be right lat and
see Lewis and they both been given a

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,199
task by their management like we need to
get this security shit in order so you

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:34,220
need to scan everything you have every
two weeks so she loses a classical guys

18
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,240
who goes for a classical approach he
buys or it gets a scanner and in this

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,810
case I got message in open fast they're
about demo with message but it can be

20
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,640
anything else and in order to do that it
means he has to get up really really

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,530
early and this is what it felt like when
I got up this morning by the way that he

22
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,840
needs to go and start the scanner in
maintenance window because these tools

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,930
mind-numbing production safe wait for it
to finish and then when it's finished he

24
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,560
does his analysis end-user really
advanced tools of printing out reports

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,360
stretching things out with penso
highlighter typing a report and and a

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,250
lot of Red Bull to make up for about
night he had and it's it's why is it a

27
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,040
problem to work in this way well most
security tool seem to be written for

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,090
security consultants and and some of you
may be securities could sell them some

29
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,300
of you may not be security consultants
but I'm an OPS guy I don't get judged by

30
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,090
how thick a report I get from somebody's
desk i'm judge by keeping their stuff

31
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,930
secure and Skinner's yeah they make a
trade off between false positives and

32
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,769
false negatives and and they tend to err
on the side of caution where they say

33
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,569
well we want to know you to know about
everything even if it may not be true

34
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:01,390
because we don't want to leave stuff in
there that you are exposed but we're not

35
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,730
telling you about and that means that
they produce an awful lot of I'll put it

36
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,420
takes a lot of time to scan and it's
often poorly automated and this is a

37
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,390
plea to everybody who runs designs are
owns a security tool please please

38
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,839
please put your functionality in an API
as well if I can do it fired if I can do

39
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,569
it Friday come online please let me do
if I and maybe I as well so they're

40
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:32,950
smarter person here and just check the
stocks Kenya is be right let them be

41
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,738
right let the Site C you secure us so he
spends his morning doing some

42
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:46,319
configuration working blends going to
show up

43
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:54,379
so overview of the second bus interface
in here you have to manage scam so first

44
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:59,048
you create a workspace and on the
workspace you can at milt bill different

45
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:04,709
type of scanning so for example I'm
going to choose in essence as you can

46
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:12,689
see we do support a lot of the open
source or pay tools so let's select name

47
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:20,548
of the parameter is necessary for the
scanner to work and of course given

48
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:38,810
location what this can we create the
skin

49
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,919
and their demonstration effect so he
spent his morning configuring scanner

50
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,159
and maybe do a little trial run then he
goes home

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,180
relaxes a little bit take some beer and
the scanner runs at night because you

52
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,990
can run the scans by the command line so
you can get up to the current app and

53
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,730
then when he wakes up in the morning he
goes in any analyzes and remediation his

54
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,230
findings and and that's let's see if the
scan is finished we can do some analysis

55
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:13,790
cool so let's have a small peak so I
already start to scan for the sake of

56
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:27,810
the day tomorrow so we now have results
into the secularist so when we go here

57
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:36,650
we have an overview of the findings we
can also use the filtering up here to

58
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,940
select a different kind of ports in this
example that we have finding song so if

59
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,910
you go to the 21 port you can see that
we have a well it seems like we have an

60
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,200
issue don't be frank it seems like
anonymous FTP is enabled that's against

61
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:59,870
our security policy I don't know ask
your security officer yesterday so what

62
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,460
we want to do now is to follow it up so
we can open finding here we have a

63
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,270
detailed information about what the
finding is well we just discussed we

64
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,690
want to fix this so please fix and I
will put it to the status open that is

65
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,550
really the stage where we care about and
that's where all the good stuff is in

66
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:26,350
and we want to so I said this one to
open well there were also some other

67
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:35,490
issues so as you can see here I can go
through them like this or you still well

68
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,419
this is only port 21 so let's continue
the analysis we also had party that has

69
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:46,130
some some issues oh and here you go you
see a track and trace so it's not a real

70
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,169
issue with some very nice so we also
want to fix this one elite hackers like

71
00:06:51,169 --> 00:07:01,000
ali khan contributed so let's do it
again please fix and move it to the open

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,260
state so as you all know when when you
work a lot of security to let you get a

73
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,630
lot of noise these are the findings for
example that are really noisy you're

74
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,530
just like informational most of the time
and yeah we really don't care about its

75
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,669
like lugarda eighties open yeah I don't
see any issue with it so you can select

76
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:31,330
men only one at a time and put a 22 no
issue or you can select them all well I

77
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,248
don't then analysis it so like I don't
care I said I dunno issue

78
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:51,589
and I have done the analysis can start
mitigating so prison so so what we had

79
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:56,009
was the analysis process so what
happened in the background was we had to

80
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,389
do scan commands that we issued it
called a little script that calls the

81
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,479
scanner in this case of community over
the network within this scanner

82
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:11,329
retrieved the output convert it into an
intermediate format without intermediate

83
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:16,909
format that was loaded by any universal
low diesel into the database where it

84
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:21,029
actually stored and you can do this
stuff so in the analysis you saw that

85
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:25,429
glenn was really hope by the state is
already because you when new findings

86
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:29,748
are discovered for the first time they
got the state is new and then as a human

87
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:34,139
you get to decide whether or not you put
these findings in open stuff I care

88
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,049
about no issue

89
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,740
stuff I don't really care about and then
if you change your mind you can switch

90
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,579
things around so really the tool is
about trying to balance the work

91
00:08:46,579 --> 00:09:01,410
remediation effort and and yeah let's
remedio ok cool I will remediate

92
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,100
so if it was like easy like this right
we could do more relaxed and relax but

93
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:19,449
so I already remediate the issue so I
will start the scan again so if we take

94
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:25,469
plans usual pace for now two weeks two
weeks ago so two weeks over over and we

95
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,720
need to rescan we need to see if we fix
this correctly so she lose again breaks

96
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,639
out of his regular scanner wakes up too
early

97
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,079
gets a little square things on his face

98
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,638
leaps and and he's really needs to look
at that other report again and as he's

99
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,500
reading and going through the reporting
going through the findings eat something

100
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,569
sneaking up on them it's like I seem to
ship before but you have to be really

101
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:58,599
careful because this can report of last
week two weeks ago and scan report of

102
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:06,449
now looks a lot like there's five small
differences in there so artist is it

103
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:11,649
really worth a go through the entire
report the right led has a different

104
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:17,779
idea he is already done all the setup so
you just go home relax a bit

105
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:24,779
sleeps wakes up in the morning he can do
the analysis and let's see if it's

106
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:42,019
finished already he's alright I'm in
there so go to the web doing

107
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:50,540
so let me clear filter first we get all
the findings as you can see we had

108
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:57,309
issues in the open section federal gun
because I correctly remediate the issues

109
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:04,799
so when you go to the gun that you will
see all the items are correctly I

110
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,699
correctly mitigate it now known as FTP
access also the track and trace all

111
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:21,008
those findings in here are gone there
and find the boy anymore so but when

112
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:29,189
what what can happen when you well know
that when you create and and mitigate or

113
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:35,429
fixing issues there is always a chance
that new issues can arise so when we

114
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,910
have to look at this little change
suffers

115
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:48,980
ok so let's look exactly so we did
first-hand information finding about the

116
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,299
header information and there weren't
very detailed information about that

117
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:59,679
part Riviera Beach be version but when
we did three scan it I introduce this

118
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:05,429
new foreign ability so it got that
states changed now I need to manually

119
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:11,619
assess it and say this is really what I
don't want or is this just an

120
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:17,619
informational thing you're a false
positive case of this one this issue I

121
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:25,119
don't really like it's it's not often I
so take this please fix em dunning put

122
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:35,410
it to the set to open so again I haven't
finding I need to fix and then the other

123
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,309
ones I guess you can can mark these
other ones is no issue right you get the

124
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:44,399
previous time exactly Sottero only
information also I don't want to be

125
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,019
bothered again with us so I set them to
know issue sort of gone from my for my

126
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,779
to do list

127
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,569
well we also have the new findings

128
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:02,420
PHP version finding that's new because
yeah the scanner did not know where

129
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,729
wasn't aware of PHP be running on it but
because I introduce different ability

130
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:13,290
saying hey I'm running peach be we get a
new item from nasa saying hey this is a

131
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,589
finding would again when we go in more
depth is just only an informational

132
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,279
thing he not really an issue so again I
select the mall and set them to know

133
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,279
issue so I guess you better fix this

134
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:35,639
yeah let's let's do that so going back
to determine all I'm gonna fix the issue

135
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:57,439
I introduced me to so I correctly fixed
issue going back yard is one but it

136
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:00,139
never happens to you write that you fix
one thing and then the other thing

137
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,870
something else breaks that's highly
unlikely have a hypothetical situation

138
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:10,399
but yeah so we had the previous state
and we saw a two new ones being

139
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,579
introduced change things gone so if
something was OK in the past but now the

140
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:19,239
output changed you probably want to have
a look at it as something was no issue

141
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,110
in the past and it's now changed you
might want to have a look at it the

142
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,240
other thing is in the white arrows are
are things the system does for you is

143
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,329
when things go away if things are a new
open or no issue and they're not in the

144
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:35,569
scan anymore don't go to calm and
obviously if they're gone in the past

145
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:40,559
but they reappeared to go to New again
there's another state is called closed

146
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,290
closed these means something like it's
gone but I'm happy that it's gone so you

147
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:50,040
can move it there and then the system if
it we find it again it will put it back

148
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:58,269
to New and then obviously you got in got
findings like Google Nexus 12.3 points

149
00:14:58,269 --> 00:14:59,570
prior five

150
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,030
and and it tells you for every host and
you got a special category for that it's

151
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:08,270
called mast where you put things in and
as long as they're in mass they will

152
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:14,000
never ever go to another status unless
you manually put them back into new so

153
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,680
the whole idea behind it if it's ok if
it's okay it's okay don't worry about it

154
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,780
go sit on the beach and enjoy so typical
remediation time two weeks see Lewis

155
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,959
well those who don't learn from their
mistakes are forced to repeat I'm so he

156
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,280
does it all over again be right like
those at all over again as well but it

157
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,350
for him it's just driving home relaxing
playing a bit of pink bowl waiting for

158
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,570
the scanner to finish while he sleeps
and then when you wake up in the morning

159
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:52,670
you can go into your final analysis then
as cool and returns to the screen you'll

160
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:08,410
probably see that that last thing he had
was fixed as well

161
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:21,089
so so we fixed anonymous we fixed the
track and trace and let's have a look

162
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:29,839
change this probably the new so now
again it was already an issue finding

163
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,029
before with again the content of the
header change so it's a changed finding

164
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:41,319
and as you can see it's now correctly
being set to serve tokens protection so

165
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:49,069
it's not leaking any information about
PHP or apart you so we correctly yet so

166
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:58,589
let's go to the slights again

167
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:07,930
so seculow such as such a complex name
well it's it's a name of its related to

168
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:13,250
the name of the demon and a steven is
the secular and thus are keepers kills

169
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,819
young guys like lamb by coming in at
night while they sleep and having sex

170
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:25,409
with it over and over and over again at
some point it will wear you down now

171
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,870
this second bus has a has a male
customer it's the in sexiness and it

172
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:35,590
where security operations people down by
keep having to have those

173
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,010
vulnerabilities and keep getting them
into your infrastructure over and over

174
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,890
again and you want to move on and then
you got the sexiest and and secular life

175
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,410
mission is to wear their abilities and
weaknesses in your infrastructure down

176
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,980
by putting them into the face of
operations people to make sure they

177
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:59,410
actually fixed airship so why would you
use secular is why would you use

178
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,690
automation like this as well if you do a
month lease can you have to get up can

179
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,930
schedule that but you can schedule only
does findings that need your attention

180
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:15,580
will get it less errors because there's
less repetitive boring work and the

181
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,960
amount of effort is proportional to the
amount of changes and that means that if

182
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,610
you have more changes on your network
you probably have more risk on your

183
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:28,889
network as well so by creatively
comparing findings you can really cut

184
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,380
the fat out of the analysis process no I
wasn't I was I was here before I was

185
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,020
here six years ago talking about the
tool called auto nasa's which would then

186
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,690
renamed and back down I have an ultimate
goal and the ultimate goal for

187
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:49,150
shopkeepers was to be the hub of all our
vulnerability scanning tools and give it

188
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,830
one really one workflow one place to to
manage this

189
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:58,419
well it has evolved like I said it's
gotten a new name here at confidence

190
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:04,200
last time I was here since then we've
we've added a few scanners so you can

191
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,810
now just do a little bit more than just
necessary hope of us we rewrote the week

192
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,480
is it really didn't look nice

193
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,630
with his Beamer it still doesn't look
nice so I hope you forgive me but it's

194
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:22,020
really improved already and we
introduced evil and evil stands for the

195
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,530
intermediate from her ability
information language and it's a tool to

196
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,149
make for ability scanners and their
chance each other and make tools

197
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,040
understand what comes out of our
abilities can now some of you may be

198
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,700
familiar with ASCAP and ASCAP tries to
do the same thing but i think is ascap

199
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,950
tries to be too clever it tries to
capture and fit every corner case that

200
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,790
you can have for dealing with
vulnerability information and therefore

201
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,129
it has a specification of 63 pages I
wanted something that was simple simple

202
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,160
to read simple to write simple to use

203
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,120
wasn't open format so it's licensed
under the MIT license and it makes it

204
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,179
really easy to integrate stuff I set six
years ago it was here in six years a lot

205
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,810
of things can happen to get my kids but
also planned join our organization and

206
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,580
he thought in other ways to use the
tools so yes oh well I joined like

207
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:24,610
almost two years ago and my main focus
this web application security well and I

208
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,580
said to frank let's let's implement this
into a pipeline and using settlers had

209
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,230
more to link to it and also for
replication and why do we want this well

210
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,500
what I've seen my experience is that all
the attackers are moving from the

211
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,390
network layer and the infrastructure
layer to the web application layer

212
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:50,800
delays and because of that we need more
tools to help and support us and with

213
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:58,330
secularist that's the real cool thing to
put it in so and also I'm I am only one

214
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:06,040
guy so it's really hard to to clone me
or you know shared Sheridan College

215
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:15,290
slow yeah and not like 20 years and you
don't get the exact copy I'm sorry so

216
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:23,450
yeah we really want to indicated in our
continuous delivery process so what I

217
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,350
did was the first win

218
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,149
skip fish so the guy escape

219
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:36,220
holding a fish yeah now it's give fish
it's open source tool from Google it's

220
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:43,850
very noisy it's it's not very subtle so
it's a little also not predictions safe

221
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:52,969
I did find that out so I remember that
one yeah yeah so but again very useful

222
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,950
the first web application scanner that
was implemented in secular so the next

223
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:06,200
thing I did was the second wind up Roxy
really like a loss also open source try

224
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,020
to help the people it's like burp it's
free speech

225
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:18,240
actively developed and maintained and
its overall spectra projects to give you

226
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:31,230
an example of how to start ups can it's
real so first I'm gonna show you manage

227
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:41,510
can I create new scam I say sup I
selected scanner well here he can put

228
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,879
into options so sup supports session
cookies you can put them in there you

229
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,820
select the host you want to attack
that's probably not going to it it's was

230
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:04,230
I P feat 12 so you get the point you
create the skin and of course you need

231
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,560
to fill in about I need to put it in the
book trigger will do so we go to do

232
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,679
normally this is like a friend told in
chrome tablet will be run on a melody so

233
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:22,210
I'm doing it now just for the sake today
more and then you can go to the findings

234
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:32,460
and here you have dissolved findings let
me select the correct one as you can see

235
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:39,450
in here we have new findings that self
discovery and we need to address them

236
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:52,190
just to give you an example so yeah I I
was very busy with automating tooling

237
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,890
and then implement that in

238
00:23:53,890 --> 00:24:01,390
into second verse but I also wanted to
get closer in in the feedback loop to

239
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:07,060
help developers and not coming in a very
late process and telling them he dish

240
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:14,970
you know you should do it like that or
the loop was too big so I wanted to help

241
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,510
developers writing better and secure
code so that's why I started like a year

242
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:25,170
almost ago the security knowledge
framework where we tried to capture all

243
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,790
those yeah information so it it puts a
developer in the states who creates yes

244
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,580
security by design and its proposed
development face how we call these

245
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,110
security framework and oppose
development face the developer can

246
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:46,820
select the type of functionality you
want to creating and based on the type

247
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,110
of functionality to assess what type of
fern abilities can arise when creating

248
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:58,909
that type of functionality thats
functionality like I want to upload a

249
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:05,760
file or i want to do any banking
transaction or use PHP or I want to

250
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,560
write myself right to write my CGI
scripts in shale in that case you'll be

251
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,290
shocked

252
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:17,680
yes so that that's the pre-development
phase where you can really do secure by

253
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:25,250
design and we also have proposed
development face and then there we saw

254
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,020
you already created a coat and you have
a sort of a checklist used over

255
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,510
application security first gatien
standard so that means that if you

256
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:40,900
implement level 3 I think she talked
about 160 security controls that you

257
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,740
need to develop implement as a developer
to protect your application against

258
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:53,320
attackers so we we use the checklist as
a sort of expert system system expert

259
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,970
where basically own questions it will
correlate again the foreign abilities

260
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,600
and sent them to the developer saying oh
you said no to this checklist item that

261
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,269
means that an attacker can do

262
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:11,509
this this and this and the solution is
on how to approach it you know to create

263
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,070
it

264
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:22,099
secure so it's really fresh it's just a
top 22 BIOS so if people want to join

265
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:28,089
our help improve please let me know we
can use to help and on that same road as

266
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:36,279
any open source project this is not
something we do to sell off this is

267
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:40,289
something that we do to say thank you to
the community we do it in our free hours

268
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:44,749
we do it in a spare time we do it when
our kids are sleeping that sort of that

269
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:48,919
sort of time is it is what we use for
our products so we can really need we

270
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:54,339
really need help them all the help we
can get if you can code in Pearl

271
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:58,499
irregular or or if you could go . we
probably can use your help

272
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:04,729
integrating more tools we need your
feedback on what stuff you need to be

273
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:05,700
added two days

274
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,889
functionality you need to add they got a
database with vulnerability there's

275
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:15,570
plenty of more you can do that just a
workflow automation we need people to

276
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,349
test to actually verify if the correct
we were smoking while we're doing this

277
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:25,389
was actually good cricket bats crack and
we need people to help us documents and

278
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:29,678
people to use this I mean this Indian we
do this because we want people to have

279
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,649
useful tool if we want to make your life
better and yes people are not using the

280
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:40,449
tool that we've done it for not I want
to address a little bit the road map

281
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,849
that we have four seconds at the moment
we're currently in the process of

282
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:51,399
rewriting the user interface and the
developer thats doing that it's finally

283
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:54,258
somebody said Frank is it doesn't look
good

284
00:27:54,259 --> 00:28:00,610
please move over and like hands off I'll
go so we're rewriting it in angular

285
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:06,178
to make it to make it more smooths the
timeline on that is real soon now we

286
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,970
were hoping to release it didn't make
that deadline unfortunately we want to

287
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,809
add functionality so you can go into the
GUI and actually scheduled and click end

288
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:23,379
and start your scans there and threw an
API obviously integrated with the

289
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,790
security knowledge framework so that you
can actually get the findings out but

290
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,620
also tell you this is in the security
knowledge framework where you need to go

291
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,739
to to find the right pattern instead of
the anti pattern we want to add user

292
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,679
management user rights management in
there so that you can actually say these

293
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,610
are the people that are allowed to view
this workspace these are the people that

294
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:47,729
are allowed to edit and workspace some
sort of issue tracking in there although

295
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:53,970
I prefer not to rewrite something like
grr and and some sort of reporting and

296
00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:00,850
then yeah I'm still looking for feedback
do we need to add more in there and what

297
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:06,918
other people do when the ultimate
feedback is also usually pull request so

298
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,880
talking about the new user interface
that this is the first time I'm going to

299
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,730
publicly give a sneak peek at what it
will look like and these are real

300
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,299
functional screens just not all
functions have been implemented so this

301
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,580
is the main screen where you get where
does a version check and check the

302
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:29,659
configuration this is it's can setup
screen and now you can see I'm not

303
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,370
really a front-end developer because the
guys make it look a lot better and this

304
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,879
is what the finding screen will look
like and I'm obviously does filtering

305
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,990
capacities we have there yet we still
need to to extend them and with that I'm

306
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,450
starting to approach the end of what I
have to say in the message I have to

307
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,370
bring we could do a little more demos or
anything but for now it's it's questions

308
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:02,580
anybody so in the back sorry I'm having
a really hard time

309
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:14,580
we do we have linked up to you

310
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:21,100
type some passport what is it like an
encryption for data it's it's about it

311
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,399
so it should hide their it's only needed
42 likenesses because it uses the API

312
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,168
going to use that password

313
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:39,330
it's also the other scams like thinks
it's ok because like most of the results

314
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:48,059
are sensitive data so that there is
authentication in the sexiest do we get

315
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:51,799
a shame to say that it still depends on
the server framework so it's either

316
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:57,029
basic auth or or something else you've
set up at the server level but the

317
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:00,570
resultant there is the possibility to
run authentication only give certain

318
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:08,600
people access for the damn out that was
a bit too steep for any other questions

319
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,750
you might have

320
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:26,600
because this is also for vulnerability
management yes so I can you integrate

321
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,780
their money while penetration testing
results into this

322
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:39,750
not at the moment because there's
nothing to convert to iPhone so it's

323
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,050
really aimed at a tooling but it's
definitely something that that's

324
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:48,930
probably doable if you're looking for
something to automate your report

325
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,310
writing but it's not what we what we
focus on what we really make a

326
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:58,020
distinction in the company between the
manual testing the automated testing

327
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:05,440
before I call in a security expert to do
extended testing on a platform I want

328
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,790
anything that I can find myself with the
scanner to be out there i mean that's

329
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:23,010
let's not waste you guys let's really do
it first steps properly ourselves

330
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:29,950
changes in systems which are to the
positive for example you scanner system

331
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:35,360
and you get certain vulnerabilities and
without you guys knowing somebody then

332
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,479
installs patches and you scan again and
some of the issues you find the first

333
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,040
time will go away do you have a sort of
positive Delta were you can send us a

334
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,379
system has now changed for the better
because it used to have seven

335
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,830
vulnerabilities and already has two or
something so it's not about your

336
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:01,419
abilities is about findings okay and and
and I find if I find something it might

337
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,230
be beautiful or it might be ugly the
tool doesn't care about whether it's

338
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,200
beautiful or ugly 22 cares about that
you found something and that something

339
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,430
has changed and it's it's still a lot of
these tools that you have out there in

340
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:21,290
the market place their their elevator
pitches by my tool and you could fire to

341
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:26,170
security guy and and this is not what
this is about because I think you come

342
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,510
in the end you can't replace human
intelligence behind to keep or you

343
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:34,690
really need to have human intelligence
looking at that finding but then if you

344
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:43,560
got like a well paid overworked
understaffed Security Department you

345
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,100
don't need to bother them with with with
with it with the scanner that goes along

346
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:54,949
with its web server Apache yes yes I
know it's like like this having this

347
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,150
hyperactive child in their not good for
your productivity they're fun they're

348
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,490
not good for your productivity and even
if so if you want to be where now bye

349
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:08,239
bye having having a bunch of hyperactive
children go away go ahead but if you can

350
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,310
dampen that hyperactivity and just get
what you need to respond to and it's

351
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:17,080
really like ya logo you having them if
it's really only two changes it makes

352
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,029
you realize a lot more efficient

353
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:37,820
ok zero visibility ok connectivity to
the IP server directory server to manage

354
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:43,510
users can access to the interface to the
information so it's it's it's it's not

355
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:49,460
built in it is something we can have 222
roadmap about for instance what you

356
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,870
could do is set to set up your Web
server to do the authentication against

357
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:56,489
LDAP and that's actually what we have in
the office so we got the web server

358
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:02,410
setup to do the authentication against
LDAP and then the and then we take

359
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:13,210
whatever past and hold it against her
exes do you plan to implement some user

360
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,390
roles

361
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:22,759
in case of when I have some fun things
and want to assign particular drop to

362
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:32,339
fix it to the particular user that is so
probably the best thing to do

363
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:36,299
there and that's in the future and
hoping with a new GUI framework that we

364
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:41,470
we have more capabilities of doing tool
integrations so so so the short answer

365
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:49,189
is not right now the longer answer is I
think it's probably best to create the

366
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,440
ticket in a ticket system so you
probably have a ticket system if it's

367
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,529
something like what we probably can do
in the future is say if you've got an

368
00:35:57,529 --> 00:36:03,109
issue you can click a link that will
create a ticket in JIRA dats you

369
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:08,589
assigned to somebody to follow up and
then it will only go to to gone into to

370
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:14,019
lift their scanner actually ran again
and so a defining is gone so it's really

371
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:24,758
about managing the final results are not
about managing remediation effort I you

372
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:29,900
can probably better than I use their
questions so if this evil death sorry my

373
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,759
basic ok thank you thank you all
