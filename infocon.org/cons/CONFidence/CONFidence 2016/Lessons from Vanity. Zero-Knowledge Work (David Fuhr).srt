1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,599
ok ok

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,370
hi I'm going to talk about zero
knowledge work

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,900
what to trust the cloud or crowd with
and whatnot

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,159
or how and I call the talk lessons from
vanity

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,300
we'll see why am I work for high
solutions in Berlin security consultancy

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,269
specialising in and technical topics
like fantastic forensics are also hiring

7
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,449
so if you want to move to billion i
passed me a note

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,030
I live in or so and i'm interested in
the the edge cases of information

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,369
security like ICS where it gets very
physical cloud where it gets very

10
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,369
virtual or crypto this is where I come
from

11
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:03,360
today it's not about ICS but about the
other two cloud in crypto ok as we all

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,110
know as you know more and more and more
processes are transferred into the cloud

13
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:14,850
or thrown at at crowdsourcing my don't
have to name all the examples you you

14
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,419
know them

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,630
why is this happening you can make a big
analysis

16
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:23,429
the short one is things are being
networked more and more so it's possible

17
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:29,789
there's some efficiency gains division
of labor capital and sent intensity is

18
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:34,950
not specific to cloud this is happening
in other parts of economy as well and

19
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,840
then it's also a kind of fashion or bars
so everybody thinks they they have to do

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,969
they have to sell their to be part of it

21
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:50,490
cloud and crowded said what is cloud you
can make it complicated definitions at

22
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,979
different aspects and so on for us today
it's just somebody else's computers &

23
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,759
crowd is other people's computers as
it's not the same in cloud you think

24
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,250
more about someone who owns a lot of
computers and in crowd you think of a

25
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,460
lot of people who owned one computer or
a few computers each but

26
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,340
in the end it from the from the
confidentiality perspective

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,410
it has a lot of things in common you
give away things that should be private

28
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:32,070
you want to be private to someone you
don't know perfectly you cannot control

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:42,180
and so on and so are outsourced to the
cloud or crowd security relevant

30
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,930
processes for example back bounties is
where you tap into the the power of the

31
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,510
other crowd to help you find bugs and
also security relevant calculations for

32
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:01,350
example has tracking you can buy that as
a service in the cloud and this is only

33
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,760
the beginning and more there

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,890
more will come and my first question is
is this a good idea to to outsource

35
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,369
security relevant calculations to the
cloud

36
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:18,690
do you think good here no good idea
depends on the criteria of course

37
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,930
so i made a simple chart

38
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,170
it's too simple so it's not true but
there are things that that you could

39
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,950
cool could call a good idea like
likeback bounties they they have a lot

40
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,929
of advantages for the father 12 -

41
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,400
running them and all sometimes also for
the people participating

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,230
there are some things that are
definitely bad ideas like their services

43
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,030
where you can order

44
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,570
handmade passwords that were handcrafted
specifically for you didn't bring the

45
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,280
switches but it really can buy these
things or explicit password checks like

46
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,310
sending your password summer and ask

47
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,590
this service is this a good password
because what do you do when they say s

48
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,630
you don't know where it went and what
was gonna what else is going to being

49
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,040
have been done with it

50
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,019
then there's a lot of things where it
really depends whether it's a good idea

51
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,539
or not storage is such a thing

52
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,100
depends a lot on your on your
requirements if availability is key and

53
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,000
confidentiality doesn't really matter

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,930
then the more store to get the get and
the more distributed the better than

55
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,750
cloud is certainly a good idea for you
has cracking depends on how much you

56
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:41,140
trust the service where you got the
house from what you will do after they

57
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,190
have been correct or they couldn't be
incorrect and and so on and also with

58
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,460
entropy you can you can gather entropy
for a lot of sources

59
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,950
this can be a good thing but you have to
be careful how about creation of a

60
00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:00,159
symmetric key pairs so as a metric
cryptography usually have a key pair a

61
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,280
private key and a public key and they
have to be linked mathematically so they

62
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,280
usually are created together in some way

63
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,390
should you outsource this to the cloud
or crowd know the name private key says

64
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,120
it basically it should be private

65
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,830
this is why it's called the private and
that's maybe the worst idea of what you

66
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:30,729
could outsource to one of the worst
ideas what you could outsource there's

67
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:36,550
it's easy to come up with a bunch of
examples where it's safe two outs or

68
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,950
something but they're not very
interesting like you can just ask for a

69
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,030
passport at some service and then not
use it or use it for something that's

70
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,989
irrelevant

71
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,930
ok trivial you can request some
randomness and in corporate in in in

72
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,620
your state that is already a good

73
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:03,880
random state and and not not not break
that state that can be okay

74
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,390
you might even now it's getting more
complicated

75
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,720
make it password hash it with the
cryptic art cryptographically secure

76
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,030
hash function so one that can certainly
not be reversed and maybe even takes

77
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,440
some time to calculate to make a brute
forcing harder

78
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,280
send it to and database and ask has
somebody already use this password or

79
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,150
this hash before but you should only do
this if you're really sure that you pass

80
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,340
what is not proof possible so not in any
word list not too short not and so on

81
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,659
and so on

82
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:47,469
and if the hash itself will not do any
harm

83
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,270
because sometimes it's enough for people
to have your hash for some attacks so

84
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,020
you might take another has fractions
that use the nowhere else and and and so

85
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,830
on and so on

86
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,698
so there's a lot of ifs here so it
quickly gets complicated a more

87
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,900
interesting example that i stumbled
across a couple of months ago is the

88
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,440
creation of vanity Bitcoin addresses so
there's three terms in here

89
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,090
what is Bitcoin was a Bitcoin address
and what is vanity address

90
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:31,990
bitcoin are ok you can say our that's so
2000 a tour 2013 or whatever depending

91
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:38,289
on when people came to the topic of of
Bitcoin and it's true

92
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:43,719
and this is not a talk about Bitcoin i'm
going to take in something from Bitcoin

93
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:48,699
to show another . but for that to
understand I need to show you a few

94
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,300
things about Bitcoin that you might know
or not now

95
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,800
here for example is the development of
the exchange rate or wait that the lock

96
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,729
scale

97
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,650
this is the better one that's the the
the real scale

98
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,380
yeah it has a long development

99
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,150
a lot of money was made and lost with
Bitcoin it's still alive people say it's

100
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,900
dead

101
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:21,560
it hasn't made its way into general life
so it's used worldwide but not a lot

102
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,960
so transaction numbers as they are
ridiculously low compared to other

103
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,710
payment systems but it has it was the
first with a lot of interesting ideas

104
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:41,150
and it's still the most used and so for
for for some reason the most interesting

105
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,770
cryptocurrency not technically
mathematically made but for the whole

106
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,350
ecosystem and so on

107
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,100
so what's Bitcoin in october two
thousand eight

108
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,890
somebody called satoshi nakamoto wrote
an email to the to the cryptography

109
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,830
mailing list that he came up with
something new with a paper is the paper

110
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,670
first page

111
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,229
it's just nine pages so if you interest
it really read it read read the original

112
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,320
papers it's it's worth it

113
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:21,080
and the main properties of this Bitcoin
that he invented are listed here and we

114
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,650
don't really need most of them today so
I'm so i'll be just very short so

115
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:35,870
digital currencies in a are easy in a
way you can you can build some parts of

116
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,510
trust with digital signatures but
information has one disadvantage or 11

117
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,800
different station from physical
currencies like gold

118
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,400
you can copy information almost for free
so when you spend a coin some buzz

119
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,510
somehow it has to be prevented that you
spend it another time because you can

120
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:03,140
just keep a copy and nobody would trust
the coin if they wouldn't know if they

121
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,640
had been spent or not

122
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,530
so you need something to keep track of
what was spent or not he proposed a

123
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,360
peer-to-peer network

124
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,060
so you don't need any central authority
those central trusted party or mint

125
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:25,990
anonymity is possible and you need a way
to introduce new coins and he used the

126
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,910
hashcash algorithm for for that was
invented in two thousand and two

127
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,100
thousand trees out there and one as a
proof of work so this is one of the most

128
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:43,390
interesting ideas to create coins you
need to work to calculate a lot and

129
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,880
everybody will believe that you did this
calculation or did did the amount of

130
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,870
work

131
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,910
statistically at least so that so that
you earned this

132
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:04,180
this coin and the the likely the most
the most genius idea it was to use this

133
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,760
coin generation process at the same time
to solve the double spending problem but

134
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,630
about this on another day

135
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:19,990
this hashcash what is it it's a it's a
it's easy and nice nice thing you take

136
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:30,370
some random thing as string number and
hash it you have to happen to agree on

137
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:37,120
the hash function before and just check
if it starts with as specified substring

138
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,730
for example with with zeros with a
certain number of zeros sometimes will

139
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:50,710
this will happen by chance and usually
not and they the probability that it

140
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,240
will happen depends of course on the
length of the substring that you that

141
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,480
you demand and it is a good hash
function

142
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,550
there is no no shortcut you cannot
calculate

143
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:10,599
a string that would have to something
like 0 0 0 in an efficient way other

144
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:16,029
than brute force because if so the half
function would be would be broken would

145
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:24,159
be a not not premature resistant so this
is X exponentially expensive in the

146
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:30,069
length of the of the substring so not
only more expensive but to the power of

147
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:38,498
the length so means significant links
are intractable you can only do it for

148
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:44,499
very short length and this can be used
as a proof of work because it's a lot of

149
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:47,739
work to calculated and because it's
scalable

150
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:53,409
so you can you can set a certain
difficulty and make people work for it

151
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:57,009
and you can check whether they achieved
it or not

152
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:05,499
ok you can use this hashcash or similar
schemes for four different things

153
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:09,939
the original idea was to use it for spam
protection so before you are allowed to

154
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:13,449
to send out and an email on smtp server

155
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:16,719
you have to prove you did a little bit
of work

156
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,529
this will make it very expensive to send
very large amounts of emails

157
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:28,299
it wasn't really implemented for and
practice for several reasons

158
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:33,579
you could use it for cloud performance
assurance

159
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:40,478
that's another subject of research that
some people are doing so you can you can

160
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,389
try to track if your cloud provider
where you where you are renting a

161
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:52,629
certain service like number crunching is
really doing a lot of work for you like

162
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:55,749
you're paying this is also not what it's
about

163
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:00,039
today because we're not about
performance where about confidentiality

164
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:07,299
and of course you can use it for the
mining so for the creation of new coins

165
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:10,299
and and mining is basically this thing

166
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,140
anybody can look for for some randomness

167
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:22,010
you don't start with 0 but you have to
include the last block and this will

168
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:28,220
develop we will become the blockchain so
that people know where you are at

169
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,520
what you're what you're signing and then
you when you find the the bit of

170
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,000
randomness that that brings everything
to the 000 difficulty length then you

171
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,100
are the one who remind the coin like
mining you found a bit of gold and then

172
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,140
it's worse

173
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,000
something that is defined in the
standard like 50 bitcoins 25 bitcoins so

174
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,030
quite a lot of money but doesn't happen
so often

175
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:05,510
ok we haven't said what a coin is a coin
is simply no it's not that simple is a

176
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:11,660
chain of digital signatures so we saw
how coins are created and then a coin

177
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:19,160
can be transferred from one owner to the
next better to say from one address to

178
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,790
the next and and the owner and order
means the one who knows the private key

179
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,890
because he can sign for digital
signatures you need to know that the

180
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:38,180
private key and he can sign the hash of
the previous transaction and the public

181
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,219
key of the next or so the one

182
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,980
it's supposed to be sent to and this
will be appended to the to the coin and

183
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,290
the wood and then the coin basically
tells everybody i went there and there

184
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,360
everybody can check the whole chain
because the public keys are public and

185
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,550
they are known and the

186
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:07,569
and the peer-to-peer network so the coin
we said signature what kind of signature

187
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:13,720
is that digital signature of course and
in Bitcoin it's the the ecd is a

188
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,430
algorithm the elliptical curve digital
signature algorithm

189
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:24,399
there's certain reasons why they choose
this signature scheme

190
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:33,370
one is that elliptic curves make keys
shorter so for the same security level

191
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:39,940
you need for turkeys and that means sort
of addresses and so on and they picked a

192
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,209
special curve because to do elliptical
curve calculations you need to agree on

193
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:52,089
a curve so a mathematical structure that
you do calculations like additions and

194
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:58,959
multiplications in that work a little
bit differently from standard numbers

195
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,270
that we usually use this is what makes
them more complicated but and what makes

196
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,939
them harder to break in and in a way to
reverse certain operations in and them

197
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:14,380
and they picked one that was not in the
and the

198
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,590
in the list of usually recommended
elliptic curves like from from the

199
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,919
American standards institute missed but
one that was in a deterministic

200
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,440
deterministically constructed so when
somebody gives you a curve

201
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,880
they might have built a back door and it
so they know tricks how to move around

202
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,260
how to calculate it

203
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,379
calculate faster within it and you don't
want that

204
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:51,520
and this this curve here as the nice
property that everybody can see how it

205
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,550
is developed and it's an easy process

206
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,090
there's basically not much not much room
left

207
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:05,320
- - to hide the back door and it's also
quite efficient to to calculate on

208
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,200
certain process architectures and so on

209
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:17,050
so a private key in bitcoin is 256 bits
and the public key

210
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:22,570
you just calculate so you pick a private
key for example Byron random and then

211
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:28,330
you just calculate the private and the
public key by multiplying the private

212
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:34,780
key with something called the generator
of the of the elliptic curve generators

213
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:42,340
basically one element that allows you to
to move around all the points of the of

214
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,699
the elliptic curves and it's always are

215
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,400
because it discreet always more modulus
modules some parameters it's not really

216
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:59,530
important here to understand what we are
going to okay now what is the Bitcoin

217
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,399
address

218
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:07,420
we're almost there a Bitcoin address is
basically a

219
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,029
public key mmm there's something some
steps in between it is hashed and

220
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:17,179
rehashed again and it gets the prefix

221
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:23,330
- - to convey some more information and
then it's encoded in days

222
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,990
58 we'll get to that so this is one
example

223
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:34,158
this is my address my just means that i
have the private key for this on my

224
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:40,399
laptop so i might transfer the money
that gets there somewhere if I don't

225
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:46,518
leave loose the private key anybody else
who steals the private key or can guess

226
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,240
it can also also owns the money in that
way

227
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,940
so what is this phase 58

228
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:04,970
it's those characters to see what what
what they are

229
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,840
isn't that pays 64 what's the difference

230
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,080
anything missing anything too much in
there something that should be missing

231
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,080
missing what's missing

232
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,389
so that the two special special
characters off base 64 of haha

233
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:37,250
/ and or or plus are missing but then we
would be at 60 days 60 - what else is

234
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:47,960
missing a high why is that ok ok so it's
just a 64 you take away the the special

235
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,680
characters

236
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,100
+ + / and also the ambiguously looking
characters 0 a call

237
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,159
l and what's the other

238
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,900
I capital I and and L

239
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,890
yeah so you get to two x 26 that's the
alphabet + 10 digits

240
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,240
+ - that's the special sauce that will
be a 64

241
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:25,880
- those six soul 58 how much information
can you can you put in there almost year

242
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,470
of 5.9 a bit spare character

243
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,230
so that's only a little less efficient
than base64 if you get too long numbers

244
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,820
for forbid feels som something like that
it's it's not a good because it doesn't

245
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,600
it will align with with with with bites

246
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,719
ok it's not only used in Bitcoin also in
other places sometimes in little

247
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,710
variations so and the the third we had
Bitcoin we had Bitcoin address and we

248
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,990
had vanity Bitcoin address

249
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,420
I just

250
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,840
copy the the definition from from
wikipedia what is vanity

251
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,449
the excessive belief in one's own
abilities or attractiveness to others

252
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:16,630
and then it goes on that reduce not to
be so negative like it like it sounds

253
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,810
today and just mean futility

254
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:24,490
so in vain you still have it in in vain
added in vain

255
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:34,480
I didn't it didn't have any fruit and
there was vain glory an old term because

256
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,530
vein was not negative but the the glory
had the boosting part I in it

257
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:49,660
ok you can make some some pans all of
that i'm skipping those and their the

258
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:56,380
seven deadly sins last gluttony greed
sloth wrath Envy pride and hope knows

259
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:02,830
we're already at seven so there was no
space left for vanity but luckily Pope

260
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,389
Gregory said that vain glory is a part
of pride

261
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:13,420
so we're we're talking about a partly
deadly sin part of a daily thing

262
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:21,280
now seriously vanity address is just a
nice-looking not really rememberable

263
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,020
because they will still be a little too
long and complicated will see why but

264
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,520
still nice looking address with a hint
at something like the owner or the

265
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:37,420
organization this defeats one of the
aims of Bitcoin because we wanted

266
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,160
anonymity or at least pseudonymity and
if i call my address

267
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,650
I don't know 1.high solutions something
then part of the anonymity is gone of

268
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:53,470
course so you have to think about that
but you can have example x1 pay me and

269
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:59,050
then it goes on goes on with some human
readable substring after the leading one

270
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,480
you always have a leading usually one
can be something else and the beginning

271
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,820
can be nice looking that's a vanity
address

272
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,840
and why should you outsource this what
why would you get the idea because

273
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,030
pretty addresses like like this

274
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,590
they need to be calculated this is this
trial and error thing we talked about

275
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:26,030
that's exponentially expensive like
mining so it makes sense to give this

276
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:31,070
task to those who have the right
hardware in place to do it efficiently

277
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:39,290
and nowadays or for mining nowadays who
need a special hardware a 60 and and big

278
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:45,290
big big installations of them and here
depends on the length of the of the

279
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:51,409
vanity address if you can do it with the
with a standard computer or not

280
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,980
okay there's tools for it

281
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,610
vanity gin for example open sores

282
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,139
here's an example to generate something
that starts with one boat

283
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:14,930
it took around 10 seconds on a standard
pc thats also versions doing the

284
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,070
calculations on the GPU obviously a good
idea

285
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:25,550
still you still much less efficient than
been a six but better than cpu and

286
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:32,629
there's a vanity miners that that
automate the process of outsourcing this

287
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,030
to the crowd

288
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:41,660
now we're now we're getting somewhere so
my private key in the cloud

289
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,290
hadn't we said that was a bad idea

290
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,120
because it coins have been stolen

291
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,419
really for fallout of reasons of course
stolen ki stolen wallets like that's the

292
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:01,810
the standard thing but also from from
things like brain wallets or poorly

293
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,419
sourced randomness

294
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,420
what is the brain wallet

295
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:16,390
the brain wallet is the attempt to to
store bitcoins what you need to store is

296
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:23,260
basically the private key to a coin in
memory human memory that therefore brain

297
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:30,670
brain wallet because as long as the key
is not recorded somewhere else

298
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,390
the coin exists only in the whole his
mind

299
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,490
meaning that there's unless bitcoin is
seriously broken

300
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,560
there's no way to transfer the money
away from your from your coin from your

301
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:53,620
address has some drawbacks of the brain
wallet is forgotten or the person dies

302
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:58,600
or the coin is lost forever so them the
the money

303
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:05,350
the the coin will have the amount that
it got forever unless bitcoin is broken

304
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:12,820
or somebody changes or the community
changes the protocol early brain wallets

305
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:20,230
just took a pass phrase and hashed it
and there they have the private key or

306
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,670
sequence of private key if you want to
make a whole wallet

307
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,820
you need more than one key because you
should you should really use addresses

308
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,379
so basically we need one address for
every transaction and this was not a

309
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,220
good idea because as we find again and
again

310
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,870
humans are no good source of entropy and
this really hurts

311
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,380
in this in this case and

312
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,350
as as we speak if you make a bread and a
brain wallet out of a pass phrase that

313
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,129
is in some dictionary that is too short
too easy

314
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,669
your money will be taken away in minutes

315
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:03,769
it will be gone because some people it's
not a lot of them maybe a dozen people

316
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:12,470
were bright they they specialized in
just draining stupid brain wallets and

317
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:17,360
somebody wrote about those for God's
sake don't do it you may think you are

318
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,260
smart enough

319
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,950
so did everyone else who got robbed
humans are not a good source of entropy

320
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,510
you have a scheme haha space of all
schemes are likely to have probably only

321
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,240
has a few bits of entropy a random
phrase in a book

322
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,500
there are only about 30 bits of sentence
election in a library or no you're not

323
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,539
listening to me re oh oh crap

324
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:39,260
you think that eight characters and one
from each character class applies here

325
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,370
website security might have to deal with
a thousand attempts per second but some

326
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,719
dude with the fpga farm is probably
pretty computing a billion brain wallets

327
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,529
per second

328
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:54,049
just stop No ok so i really don't do it

329
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:58,879
brain wallets it still can be done if
you take the entropy from somewhere else

330
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:06,350
or some some clients allow you to to to
try to translate a random a good

331
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:12,289
random address into a series of random
words that you might be able to memorize

332
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:17,840
but that's something at 13 words upwards
or 20 words

333
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,139
so a lot of remember a lot to remember
and the other example was a poor

334
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,129
randomness

335
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,769
it happened for example in 2014 the
service blockchain in for one of the big

336
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,960
services in the whole ecosystem

337
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,700
they they run the tool where can one of
the tools where you can look at the

338
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,539
whole history of the blockchain its
public so everybody can look at it

339
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:44,840
everybody had can have it on their
clients

340
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,480
but they make it easier to look at what
happened in Bitcoin and they also offer

341
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,429
on online wallets

342
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:56,840
it's another question if you want to use
online wallets because one of the ideas

343
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:03,439
of Bitcoin was decentralization and if
you outsource the operation of the

344
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:10,610
wallet to some party and part of that is
is gone and they use the for just a

345
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,879
little while poor randomness and because
of another property of the little Kirk

346
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:24,710
repository photography those private
keys could be recovered and cons of some

347
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,039
hundreds of users were were stolen

348
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,129
luckily it was a good guy

349
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:38,659
people don't have a percent agree named
BTW see robin hood and he tried to give

350
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:39,500
back

351
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,210
people their money I didn't work all the
time because often it's hard to find the

352
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,649
owner of their address because of the
anonymity thing but at least a part of

353
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:52,668
the money was returned and some people
said that's a really new level of

354
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:59,899
security as the servers if somebody some
Robin Hood makes tries to make you

355
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:07,639
secure by by by getting at you and
making bringing your money to a safe

356
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,140
place and then inform you about the
about the vulnerability

357
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:20,450
maybe we can learn from that so really
cloud cloud vanity that was a question

358
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,890
and there is services for that like the
Vanity pool

359
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:31,610
you see appspot it's really cloud cloud
cloud and they have priceless and so on

360
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,320
you can you can you can order your
vanity address there

361
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,039
here's the list of orders and you can
also help in

362
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:44,270
that's why it's called the pool help in
mining those on calculating those and

363
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,710
you get to reward for that

364
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,159
this is examples of what people were are
looking for

365
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:58,010
yeah and why can this be a good idea
we're talking too much about why you

366
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,870
shouldn't do it was insecure

367
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:09,830
it can be secure for one trick and this
was in was invented by by joel cuts one

368
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:17,270
of the big names in the in the in the
Bitcoin ecosphere 2012 already and this

369
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,950
is the may be the most complicated slide
for for today

370
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:29,330
so what do you do you generate a random
private key a so this is not the private

371
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:38,750
key that you will later used to to to to
pay to to sign but like you would create

372
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:44,510
a private e week cried private key you
create this random a this should be good

373
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:51,080
randomness and then you compute the
public key public key and elliptic curve

374
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,820
we already headed

375
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,649
it's just a multiplication with the
generator so this is easy to calculate

376
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:05,090
it so efficient the other way around is
it is not possible if if this team isn't

377
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,740
broken but this we can do and we publish
our public

378
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:20,600
p so now anybody who likes to can try
random bees people log into the pool and

379
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,669
get the task and they then their start
trying random bees and what they

380
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,930
calculators

381
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,550
now it's a little bit long because
they're more steps to the address

382
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,660
we already said in the end you need the
base 58

383
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,800
if we leave that away there's some
hashing in between we can leave that

384
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:45,350
away so they basically calculate the

385
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:54,540
the the public key that you gave them a
times g plus the public key of the be

386
00:33:54,540 --> 00:34:01,230
that they just invented themselves so
they they calculate their own public key

387
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:09,540
and then they give you back the result
the result means the be that leads to

388
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,370
your vanity address something that
starts with the right sub string and

389
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:19,560
what you can do and they cannot and
that's the most important part you can

390
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:29,070
compute a plus V and this is the private
key of the vanity address because an

391
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,990
elliptic curve cryptography three

392
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:38,879
it's the same calculating a plus V and
the public key of that or separately and

393
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,139
adding them

394
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,980
that's one mathematical property of the
of this scheme

395
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,860
so you can get to the to the a plus B
and they cannot because they never got

396
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,659
the a from you

397
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:59,910
you just gave them the a times G and
there's no efficient way for them to get

398
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:05,460
from the eight times G from the public
key to the a to the private part of it

399
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,060
because if the whole thing would be
broken

400
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,060
this is not reversible

401
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:24,210
ok so if it's done right and of course
there's a lot of points what can go

402
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:28,110
wrong for example there could be a fake
website pretending to be a pool using

403
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,880
this mechanism this trick and they're
not using it or there was even a pool

404
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,410
that did it all the way all the way all
the way all the way all secure and then

405
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,970
in the end they said and now please
enter your part of the private key so we

406
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:49,770
can conveniently give you the final the
final thing and boom

407
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,200
yeah you like it was ok until in the
last step you

408
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,120
you gave him use your secret money was
gone so can we use it for other things

409
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,339
secure cloud computation

410
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,260
unfortunately not so easily because this
is very special for certain types of

411
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,660
schemes that we that we have this kind
of calculations so it's kind of zero

412
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,930
knowledge work in this case somebody
works for you but they don't get to know

413
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,930
the the secret part

414
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:31,170
this is basically a special case of of
homomorphic encryption special case

415
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,920
because in your mama hawk morphic
encryption usually have a secret message

416
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,470
you don't really have a secret message
here but homomorphic encryption is

417
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:46,620
calculations that can be done purely on
cipher text and if you can do that

418
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,920
the holy grail of cloud privacy
insurance because you can see crow

419
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,140
securely have calculations done in the
cloud with privacy kept assured

420
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,860
unfortunately they're no good
homomorphic encryption schemes that

421
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,310
there are part of a few partially as

422
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,930
homomorphic schemes with we're only a
few very specialized computations are

423
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,770
possible

424
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,120
like the example we saw or in RSA
without padding and the fully

425
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,620
homomorphic where you can do all kinds
of calculations like searching filtering

426
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,029
sorting are heading multiplication and
so on

427
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,609
I still being research there either very
very very slow or very inefficient for

428
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:35,130
from from memory reasons very
complicated but research is going on

429
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:42,330
just google it today so things are being
at our are advancing here

430
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:49,950
ok model ability i will skip now because
of the time because you must be hungry

431
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:59,459
yeah okay in the end coming back to the
seven virtues of our our vanity that we

432
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:05,400
want is a part of the pride so we're in
the in the last line and the the good

433
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,380
thing is for every advice for every sin
there is a virtue something that can

434
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,780
that you can practice that you can use
against it that that stands against it

435
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,200
and for pride there's humility

436
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,669
so maybe maybe that's if you want to
model for this talk humility

437
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,560
be careful with what you outsource and
to whom it's possible but with a lot of

438
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:36,720
ifs and the thing I like most year that
the greatest and the most important of

439
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,640
all they're just said to be charity
generosity and I think this is a nice

440
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,799
model for for a whole profession

441
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,010
so give back to the community - good
stuff

442
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,400
don't be evil and so on and that's my
talk

443
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,460
thanks thank you for him
