1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:13,289
so let's start from this salty salty is
a Stanford state of the internet

2
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,390
what is that we as a combined I have a
huge platform deployed all over the

3
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,220
internet and we see a lot of traffic

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,780
we started actually hopefully it works

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:47,280
ok we started late in 1988 and what we
did is we created this platform three

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,300
years initially was for a CD and so
content delivery close to the user and

7
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,879
for acceleration of content provided by
web service two years we have also

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,060
implemented security feature and that
actually we will see to put in a context

9
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,579
we have a huge amount of data in terms
of of security that we put quarterly

10
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:17,639
available to everybody so we produce
these a salty report the state of the

11
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:22,259
internet is produced quarterly is pretty
available together also with graphical

12
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,359
if you like them to go to after the
presentation you come to our booth

13
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,850
we will show you how it really works and
how to download it and to have it

14
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:40,439
what is the akamai platform today I i
hope it will work

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,950
this is our platform is made up of two
hundred thousand service spreading in a

16
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,490
hundred and ten countries and actually
we have a presence networking presence

17
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,869
in more than 1,400 networks so we
deliver from fifteen to thirty percent

18
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,690
depends on the kind of the day of
internet and web traffic and those are

19
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,060
the data that we serve 32 bits per
second and 40 million hits per second

20
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,519
by the way anybody of you as any idea of
how many countries nations are there in

21
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:18,480
the world

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,160
they are 101 96 196 countries

23
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,690
if you can see the 196 country compared
to that data

24
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,569
a hundred and ten counties presence and
14 networks for Tina is be 14 transit

25
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,319
networks

26
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,319
we have a huge deployment

27
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,670
plus we serve a lot of let's say good
customers which give us a full pictures

28
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,420
of what is going on to the internet that
is why actually we do that

29
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,109
what if in terms of protection

30
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,200
what do we do protect you protect
exactly what the normal

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,708
let's say and user would you do when
you're at home you will need to go to

32
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,940
1st the dns check the address of the web
that you want to surf go to the web and

33
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,930
then probably get her some data from the
database from the back and from the

34
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,190
Oracle from whatever

35
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:23,250
so what we do is we protect in the red
area there is the client and we protect

36
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,989
the dns so the DNS requests we have a
service to protect the US Environmental

37
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,940
either as primary or secondary

38
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,799
it doesn't matter after the URL has been
retrieved

39
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,700
we have a platform for web application
service web application firewall sorry

40
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,780
the web application firewall is on the
far right and also on the far west is

41
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,160
not one to one

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,060
we will pop them up on all our servers
at the same time

43
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,510
to ensure that also our protection is
close as possible to the end user or to

44
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,250
the attacker in some way to protect the
web content as a web application

45
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,230
firewall as well as we have a solution
to protect all ports and lower particles

46
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,060
for the data center this is both in
terms of layer tree attack syllable

47
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,970
metrics kind of attacks as well as a set
web application firewall so layer 7

48
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,630
attacks

49
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,320
consider these are not three different
platform is just a logical view it's

50
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
actually the same platform with
different services

51
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,110
so when what we do with this data where
we gather some data because everybody

52
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,630
was just crossing our platform naturally
leaves some information to us what we do

53
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,639
is we use actually the data and those
are the numbers just to put in context

54
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,250
why we produce the state of the internet
to pay Tobias off store data give us a

55
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,240
great visibility on what is happening
actually on the internet on a daily

56
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,260
basis and on the quarterly and yearly
one day we see more or less 20 terabytes

57
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:05,520
of data so we produce also how early
queries consider this is not just that I

58
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,200
did we used to produce quarterly reports
those are data that help us to announce

59
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,180
the security posture to define more
granular rules or less granular rules on

60
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:23,610
the firewalls for the customers and we
retain them for 45 days 45 days means

61
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,850
that we can also gather some statistics

62
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,530
you see there yes accuracy our services
are very accurate but more more

63
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,090
interesting is client reputation with
this client reputation sending the data

64
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,710
for 14 days we can see the behavior of
the single clients connecting to the

65
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,979
platform and understanding is this a
good guy

66
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:50,190
is this a bad guy or is doing something
normal is just surfing the URL but in

67
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,860
the past it was running about night he
was running some backdoor something we

68
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,460
know that

69
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,780
so we can rank the client in terms of
its reputation and then understand we

70
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,840
would block it

71
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,159
we would not block it again

72
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,840
all those data are also freely available
if you check on the top left state of

73
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,599
the internet just URL

74
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,530
it's open naturally it's on HTTPS but
you can have all these data

75
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,059
so in terms of Q 4 2015

76
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:32,650
what happens over the internet for what
we have seen there are some interesting

77
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,909
things

78
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:40,360
each black stuff is a pitch black
quality is a a DDoS attack volumetric

79
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,280
lead us attack where we are talking now
what happens if you see on the far right

80
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,690
four in the fourth quarter of 2015

81
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,860
the attacks are concentrating in an area
which is slightly below a hundred cakes

82
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,080
they last for less time and they're
concentrating their and that is because

83
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,409
mainly of two factors

84
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,070
the first one is that reflection is much
better than infection infection needs a

85
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,130
lot of effort when you go for reflection

86
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:21,969
then you can run may be smaller in terms
of time so very more little attacks

87
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:29,289
lower than a hundred geeks probably but
still very very effective and you can do

88
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:30,550
it easily

89
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,630
why because of the border and the
stressors that they're more or less for

90
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,260
free

91
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,060
that's also affecting the time of the
DDoS attacks itself because voters and

92
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:48,669
stressors normal allows you to run an
attack for probably 1202 360 3600

93
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,700
seconds so from 20 minutes to one hour

94
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,229
that is why we see a little decrees in
the attacks but they're becoming more

95
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:01,930
and more effective and on the other hand
there are also costly for who runs them

96
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,169
many times

97
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:11,400
so and in this space what are the most
effective most attacking countries well

98
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:18,150
you can imagine the usual ones china-us
career but a major effect in 2015

99
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:23,849
in the fourth quarter is that turkey
pops up with twenty-two percent of

100
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:24,719
attacks

101
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:30,900
suddenly it wasn't is never been in our
writer immediately in cool in the work

102
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,588
in the last quarter they pop up with
this numbers

103
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:39,930
why is that well first of all turkey was
not really running a tax it was used as

104
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,728
a reflection countries

105
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,990
so that's why we see these data we
naturally also the reflection attacks if

106
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:52,680
the IP addresses bhutan whatever we see
as a real attack and probably does not

107
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:00,989
that much coincidence or is there but
they starting being active slightly

108
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,839
after this problem with the shutdown of
the airplane the Russian airplane

109
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,779
eccentric cetera and so there you see
also what we normally see the difference

110
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:18,209
between enterprise protection and the
information were fur

111
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,439
well where is reached the context
actually from what's happening sudden

112
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,760
enterprise and what's happening in the
intimate level inside the country or

113
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,750
inside the country

114
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,610
the battle of the country's I shouldn't
say this but anyhow

115
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,860
in terms of

116
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,709
frequency / industry those are the data
gaming is the lion

117
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,489
why is the game in the lion - 4:15

118
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,640
well it's Christmas what if i buy a game
online and i cannot use it because the

119
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,449
platform that I want to use is heated by
a DDoS attack and that's why software

120
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,959
and technology obviously everybody's
going on a cloud

121
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,250
everybody as servers on amazon or
whatever they can be both heated by

122
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,440
attacks either they can be used as a
reflection or amplification kind of

123
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,790
attacks and another important things to
consider is the attacks are getting more

124
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,040
complex time by time

125
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,680
so what we see in the percentage of the
multi-vector attacks is a single vector

126
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,920
attack is just forty four percent less
than a half

127
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,010
all the others use at least two to treat
technology will see it probably slightly

128
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,010
slightly later

129
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:48,160
get the in terms of attack vectors see
what is happening is also the most

130
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,560
widely user chargement dns ntp and as
well

131
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,760
UDP fragment will counter the UDP
fragment because it's a pretty and

132
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,699
interesting meaning the natural children

133
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:07,300
dns and ntp gets you a lot of power in
terms of amplification of the attacks

134
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,390
so they're worth to be used

135
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,890
this is a comparison between the
different quarters

136
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:23,920
so the below blue line for each kind of
attack is the last quarter and I put the

137
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,079
plus where you have an increase

138
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,050
so as you see except from a ck you have
an increase in charge in India and in

139
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:40,390
ntp very often when at DDoS attack is
Rand using UDP technologies

140
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,899
there's also another technique use which
is

141
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,690
normal idiot the attackers tend to put
the MTU the total amt you

142
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:57,100
- 1500 or over 1,500 1,500 is normally
the maximum and use them for maximum so

143
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,350
you defragment is probably not just the
attack is just a reflection of the

144
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:09,580
others because when you go for an MTU
which is bigger than 1,500 what happens

145
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,500
is you have to fragment packets

146
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,520
if you have the fragment packets you
will obviously see you p fragmentation

147
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,150
increase but then not probably attacks

148
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:26,590
that's a side effect of other kind of
attacks that are run here is that

149
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,460
difficult

150
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:34,900
not that much this is an example of you
how you can run and ntp amplification

151
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:41,500
attack actually done on a single machine
but it's just enough if you put the mall

152
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,430
east comment

153
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:50,800
ntp if it's vulnerable as the monitoring
open which means i sent out a single UDP

154
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,300
packet just saying

155
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,890
can you tell me what time is it and he
replies to me not only when the Mon

156
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,949
least is on it will reply not only with
the timing but also with the least of

157
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,630
the server that they have access it

158
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,270
the ntp server in a given time so you
can go up to 500 with the list of 500

159
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,240
service spoofing the address

160
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,660
it's easy together a reflection attack
very very complicated countermeasure

161
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:29,829
pretty easy in fact ntp . com disabled
monitoring on the ntp server does

162
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:36,460
anybody remember this phrase comes from
the very all time I've used a couple of

163
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,990
times

164
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,440
I'm not that young unfortunately

165
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:47,280
this is a string that was use actually
on the packet switching x.25 network to

166
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,150
understand if the mix that you were
connected to with your modem was

167
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:56,760
actually replying correctly was working
effectively because this as all the

168
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,460
characters of the alphabet in it

169
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,780
that is why it was used with equal reply
you could understand if the mix was

170
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,400
properly working

171
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,439
is it yours anymore no x 25 luckily is
not use any more but with the left the

172
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,840
charging both 19

173
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:19,260
what happens you send just one packet
you ask for the UDP you ask for the

174
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,860
charges and he replies with all the
charitable list

175
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:33,720
so again very effective application and
what we have experienced in terms of

176
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,350
capabilities in terms of what we have
seen till now remember differentiation

177
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,270
of the vectors of the attack and using
multiple kind of attacks all together

178
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,670
so what we have seen has been a campaign
actually this is not from 2015 but is

179
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:57,479
the biggest we have seen on our platform
coming for and running for 21 days

180
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:05,130
together on a single customer and using
different kind of the college / luckily

181
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:13,140
this group was hitting infrastructure as
well as well but alternatively an ass

182
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,560
and the NS reflection as well

183
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,510
it lasted for 21 days those are the
peaks that you see and this is just a

184
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,200
big picture to you let you understand
how the attack was carried down

185
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:32,280
what effectively we so what we so
effectively this is the router view if

186
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:41,550
you check the red under the red total
mitigated you are on 31 . seven so 317

187
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,630
gigs mitigated or in 25 days

188
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:56,340
as well as the walls dns attacks with
peaks of over two billion for a total of

189
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:03,450
sixteen billions explorer

190
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:10,560
does everybody knows about the xor xor
is a DDoS attack that hits actually

191
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,449
linux machine

192
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:22,770
linux boxes it starts with the kind of
understanding or sniffing if ssh is will

193
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:30,060
normal if it is what the attacker does
is you start trying to pop up a bash

194
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,489
with root access permissions

195
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,410
download the mall work and it copies in
two different directories one is the

196
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,300
boot the other in the you dev and that
is what is interesting here in the you

197
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,380
have only route as read permission there
are no other kind of permissions so i

198
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,970
can only be Ron from the boot sector to
give persistence

199
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:57,030
so to know that even if after rebooting
it copies themselves also in the you

200
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:04,980
need to . d with all the permission
needed to run then what happens the

201
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:11,220
Machine infected the zombie talks back
to the command and control get back the

202
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,360
statement to the standard he is
authenticated and on port

203
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,510
350 - and this is the payload that he
gets back from common control to do to

204
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,349
the client

205
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:28,139
it is encrypted it is encrypted it is
encrypted using X or we understood that

206
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:35,370
it was after analyzing it and we created
a small script to try to decrypt it

207
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,989
if you check the second line we got a
key finally we were able to retrieve the

208
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,900
key so exploring against this key

209
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:51,190
we got the plain text and the plain text
contains just instructions on

210
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:57,400
what the zombie has to do that zombie
has to attack and the first twenty eight

211
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,070
bytes are actually unencrypted just the
payload is encrypted but it does mainly

212
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,429
is ok it is this the the checks farm

213
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:12,670
it has the common to execute you will
see below the second line as a 05

214
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:18,400
highlighted it can runs to kind of
attacks 1 is 0 5 and 1 is 0 for that the

215
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,020
common for for them

216
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:28,360
we will see what which ones they are and
it also tells the target and the number

217
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,000
of targets that he has to run

218
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:41,440
so you can go 40 for sinful payload
check the window windows is 65535 so

219
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,470
it's widely open to ensure that excuse i
had and that even a splode payload

220
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:56,409
45 what is interesting also instructed
the clients to spoof the original

221
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:02,140
address but just on the last two objects
and that is pretty interesting because

222
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:11,590
it prevents the reverse part forwarding
to be blocked in case the isp is using

223
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,639
reverse part forwarding and just proof
also the first to architect or just a

224
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,650
second doctor because there will be
class

225
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,400
what happens is you can have your packet
is dropped but this technology isn't

226
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,710
almost impossible to block it

227
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:32,320
plus we just don't rely simply on the
data that we see on the data that we

228
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,340
analyzed

229
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:39,580
naturally these analogies is fundamental
for us we will see later there is a spam

230
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,760
ball to that we have analyzed it
actually came from a customer saying hey

231
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,350
can you please analyze this

232
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,590
we also check what is really going on

233
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,629
we are on the chat we do understand that

234
00:19:50,630 --> 00:20:01,520
it's difficult to read this is again the
fifa IP address so it depends is a

235
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,260
sometimes we are causing problems
through the bad guys but not only we

236
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,060
also use this for to check with other
technologies used to attack actually

237
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,419
what are the best technology you can use
with is the trend

238
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:19,910
what is going on and once we can analyze
them what we do is we publish them in

239
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,910
our report

240
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,850
what happens then in terms of
application attack in terms of

241
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,590
application attack again

242
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:36,470
we have a situation where local file
inclusion is widely used and widely

243
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:43,220
deployed and only eleven percent of
these attacks at the application level 2

244
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:53,000
layer 7 are using the encrypted channel
so https out of the some of them

245
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,420
application layer d does is just 3 .
eleven percent infrastructure layer is

246
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:09,050
still the best and whatever is using
just HTTP get more or less on the market

247
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,040
what happens

248
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,260
more or less the same that happened
before it's heating a lot of the retail

249
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,430
industry

250
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,980
it can be because of competition it can
be because of you know also bottlenecks

251
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,990
are coming to try to understand to grab
the pricing and probability salad at

252
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,650
different price lower than the
competitor and still meeting at the time

253
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:38,240
and hotel and travel and financial
services they all have a huge database

254
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,110
which are from the mental if you are
able to retrieve these kind of

255
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,560
information from those database they
have very sensitive information in them

256
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,940
because they are run also online payment
stuff like that

257
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:56,600
let's consider median and the time and I
have actually television on demand on

258
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,919
the internet at home

259
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,360
division is moving from antennas and
cable TV over the Internet

260
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,459
and you know this is another trick that
can happen

261
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,480
what if you can block a broadcasting
television over the Internet

262
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,080
this is a spam poor the sponge bob but
we were talking before it's called

263
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,730
toward toward actually comes from an
Italian word for cakes because it is

264
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:34,770
sliced like a cake and what happens with
towards spam thought span first tries to

265
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,150
understand if you can in fact the the
machine

266
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,140
it's again working mainly on linux stuff

267
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:49,020
its first have to understand the
architecture so if it's a 32 or 64 bit

268
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:57,270
kind of architecture and then download
file which is called chrome d

269
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:03,780
it isn't encrypted we didn't have the
decryption but we saw this variable was

270
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,428
pretty interesting to ask

271
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:12,390
so we're trying to start the creeping
from there and it was kind of pain

272
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,950
because it was not

273
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,600
we thought it was firstly a base64
encryption standard but once the Crypt

274
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
it was meaningful it was grabbing stuff

275
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,409
so what we did is we further
investigation we realize that it is

276
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:31,799
basic these again and XOR kind of
encryption against number two is that of

277
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,290
a key is just against number two

278
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,220
and when you have it the cryptid what
you get is the URL

279
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,880
let's call it of the common control
anyhow of the service that are actually

280
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,669
then downloading to the client

281
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:54,419
the email list that they would like to
attack as well as the method actually

282
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:59,370
implements both method PHP email send if
it's not working this is the first

283
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,449
preferred and if you go through the
actual script and the actual listening

284
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,809
you will see and you will understand
that if it is not working then it

285
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:12,090
immediately switch to just row socket so
it will still work

286
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:22,190
and it starts sending out spam emails
memories liberties cameras they are

287
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,660
still part of the ball

288
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,280
what is happening here in the space of
civil liberties counters to understand

289
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,889
what you can attack actually is tell
that is still the preferred and we

290
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,160
realize the problems and that is not
still prefer just because you know it's

291
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,450
clear tax it's easy just bought for the
password or password guessing whatever

292
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,960
it's not just that the point is if there
are companies that are running

293
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,610
tell matt instead of for example is h or
other kinds of things like this and

294
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,290
created it means that you will probably
easily for easier than you know the

295
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,649
company's find other vulnerabilities

296
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,630
because probably configuration of the
company is not that perfect and so

297
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,310
that's why I don't notice is tried not
just for understanding that but parentis

298
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:17,720
than in the general posture of the
company in terms of scanners what we sow

299
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,840
passing into our platform like a file
inclusion this is a test which tries to

300
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,570
you get control of the wordpress the
configuration follow for price

301
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:37,700
using directory traversal the red part .
/ is directly from else are kind of

302
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,460
attack and the WPS and the

303
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:46,070
- config dot PHP is actually the
configuration for wordpress so taking

304
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:51,350
over the world press either they can try
with the common the injection

305
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:56,899
what that can do is that right just to
put this little machine for 22nd if the

306
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,390
Machine goes to sleep then

307
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:06,800
below there is the decoded attack just
for is reading if the time goes for any

308
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,340
second

309
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,899
the Machine goes out then we know it's
vulnerable and they know it's vulnerable

310
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:22,220
actually either try to install law backs
using the PHP open flash chart which in

311
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,960
a subroutine

312
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,170
which is the managing of the name for
uploading images is weak can have a

313
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,120
vulnerabilities aside and you can try
two and install a lock box 21 of

314
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,120
extending one is actually back door

315
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:47,840
this is web shell but you can install
both back door either web shells and

316
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,070
sequel injection

317
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:55,790
this is coming actually is a Shirley fan
an automated tools if you check the last

318
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,280
part of the the second line in red

319
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:04,100
UC berk elaborate ER . and that it
actually comes from the group of parts

320
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,879
wigger

321
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,710
it's a test they try to get into port
and try to have content back to this

322
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:17,750
address if the dress is there then they
know the application is vulnerable and

323
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:26,060
the last to verify again products PHP
using a sub domain of liquor subdomain

324
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,290
of flickr can be vulnerable Dora
machines that are still vulnerable to

325
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:37,070
these so remote file inclusion still
works and the last one that we see as an

326
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:42,860
example here is the same as before is
again trying to set the sleep common

327
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,240
sleep common not to the architecture to
the environment

328
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,810
really but to this sequel server so the
same function sleep can be run against

329
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,810
the the sequel server to understand if
it's vulnerable

330
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,059
and we have something to manage the box
as well

331
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:12,168
we see a lot of bonds can be mean but it
can be both can be good can be bad and

332
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:14,330
the problem is if you block them

333
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:21,470
what happens is the bottom manager would
understand it more now or later and

334
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,880
we'll try to bet together different body
to rephrase it

335
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,040
try to have a bottle it better so that
you can run it again and it we go

336
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,980
unnoticed completely unnoticed

337
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,890
so probably the best philosophy is not
to block about that but to manage it

338
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,070
manage it means let's understand first
of all do we want the bonnet or do we we

339
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,090
don't want

340
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,290
there is one which is called google bot
ranking on the internet you probably

341
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:56,750
wanted partner botnets in case you are
selling something online and you have

342
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,620
partners

343
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:02,000
you might want this bob other botnets
are bad ones

344
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,169
so you don't want them so what we can do
we

345
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:09,260
you can serve other content you can
block them

346
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,419
indeed you can just rate leading so if
they're coming too fast maybe there are

347
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,490
good ones but they're coming too fast

348
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:21,290
you can rate limiting them and so
managing the body is much better than

349
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,840
blocking them completely

350
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:32,540
if i have the network connection i can
go for a quick example of it

351
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,860
who it doesn't share actually the

352
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,940
I don't I thought I could bother

353
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,420
this doesn't work actually with the web
anyhow what we do in this in this demo

354
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:04,260
is what we can do is using both side one
with the sort of bottom land management

355
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:10,110
and the other ones without we can try to
retrieve you using a simple baht which

356
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:17,909
is publicly available is called magic .
I yo is run actually on amazon and it is

357
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,510
therefore properties there for testing
so it's a little one we can use it

358
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:29,220
what happens is from the unprotected web
server we get all the price list is a

359
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,300
web server

360
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:36,870
opencart some some of you may know it is
also a template for e-commerce when we

361
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,860
can do is we can retrieve all the price
list with all the discounts all the

362
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:47,070
things like this was a hundred dollars
now is 90 or whatever will protect the

363
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,120
side if you try to run the bot retrieve
the content what you have is the same

364
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,399
price for everyone so
ten-thousand-dollar flat on all kinds of

365
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,770
products on what kind of service sold

366
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:03,450
so the board will never know what the
actual pricing is and the but manager

367
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,980
will be never able to retrieve the
actual content and make some marketing

368
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,730
activities or try to lower the price or
you know

369
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:21,240
tricking you so from my side i am
probably running also out of time

370
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:27,900
I'm over I guess you have any kind of
questions or

371
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,570
thank you for great talk I have two
questions one about but nuts

372
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:50,439
how often do you see comments two bolts
that are encrypted so hard that you come

373
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,519
to call them

374
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:58,990
is that a real deal and the second
question is about ipv6 house that i was

375
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:06,399
going in ipv6 internet is that from the
last one ipv6 is a is the coming so we

376
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,479
don't see that much

377
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,269
we have blue very little traffic in
terms of ipv6 in terms of the . so but

378
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:14,139
it's coming

379
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:20,199
we're ready our platform support it but
we don't see that much indeed

380
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,869
because also the internet is not really
using that that that much

381
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:33,668
ipv6 talking about be a partner at the
yes but we are normally able to

382
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:39,999
understand up front from signatures so
still the IP header needs to be in clear

383
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,909
text and we can categorize them

384
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:47,649
we have a let's say we create our
signatures to understand what the body

385
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:54,070
is and which bottle is using parameters
we know some of them were there already

386
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,350
defined predefined in our platform

387
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:01,928
others are customizable so we can
customize how to understand it from the

388
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:06,309
from the header mainly you're welcome

389
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:09,309
any other question

390
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,010
my colleagues doesn't have any questions
for me

391
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:42,190
ok you you said about managing bolts &
lock nuts and um i would like to know

392
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:48,550
more maybe about when the apartment is
really militias for for the systems

393
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:54,639
isn't it better to block it even for for
of I don't know a date week to prepare

394
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,120
more to for this management of this of
this but net or or earth are just

395
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,610
killing they're getting the traffic from
from from the but yeah well the point is

396
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,230
if you block the bar tonight

397
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:15,909
what happens is there is no actually
returned to the manager of the botnet

398
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:16,359
sale

399
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,480
you would understand that something is
going wrong so it's better not to block

400
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,620
it because you will make modifications
are on the honor code and we make it

401
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:30,850
more sneaky or undetectable and he will
return from time to time so blocking is

402
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:37,210
really many girls to the bars over the
boss actually but in other cases it is

403
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,760
better to go for other kinds of things

404
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,970
the first one is serve alternate company
just a trick around about itself

405
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:51,640
the second one is indeed rate-limiting
so if it's coming in with too much

406
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,600
let's try to slow it down

407
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,950
we can put delay 40 seconds up to eight
seconds ten seconds

408
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,939
so the requests are coming in very
slowly and we can freedom and with for

409
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,880
the actual usage of the web server
itself

410
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,130
so those are the two main techniques
that we use for for managing the boss

411
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,220
they are the most widely used also to
our customers

412
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,750
you're welcome

413
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:32,800
I ok about protecting care about botnets
is this good solution to add some honey

414
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:41,050
pot like redirecting the preparing some
some solution some fake system with fake

415
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:49,960
data and do you use this kind of
protection like like honey pot in the in

416
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,630
the in the during the attacks or the
other but that's definitely that was

417
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:01,510
actually the meaning of the demo but
it's looks like the video is not going

418
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,050
with

419
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:07,150
anyhow yes what we do is we serve with
right sir about the content and it's

420
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,550
always about it you get the idea sorry

421
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:14,230
not just if you were with akamai I mean
in general you can put on your your own

422
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:20,320
on apart and give back fake information
to the bottom left that analyzed

423
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,160
obviously yes that's why we have to pay
a divider

424
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,610
ok ok store them yet let's let's make an
army potter wear a grey website the

425
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:35,770
alternate content or whatever it can be
a single page whatever keep it and then

426
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,150
redirect

427
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,150
so the content start the logs

428
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:49,100
thank you button the

429
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,299
that serving alternate company is
actually not just because you're free

430
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:58,280
your bandwidth for for for use but is
also giving false information back

431
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,900
consider if it is a competitor 1
understand what's your price list online

432
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:08,090
if you're selling shoes for example he
wants to understand what's the price for

433
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:12,290
your shoes if you have any kind of
discount policies or whatever you know

434
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,020
on an e-commerce website for example

435
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,280
it makes a lot of time of effort if you
do it manually because you have to serve

436
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,700
all the single pages take down the
numbers and whatever better to set up

437
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,919
about which we have all the content and
then checking it with our database or

438
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,110
whatever if you're able to us to provide
the but manager with a fake content he

439
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,690
will never understand what your
marketing policies is at the moment

440
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:41,420
opposite - I don't know

441
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,280
let's think about

442
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,790
booking book he relies on hotels and
other things that are effectively they

443
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,380
are but they're good

444
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,250
so you want to have the traffic that is
the sense of managing the bar tonight

445
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,630
you should first understand which both i
would like to have which but i would

446
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,590
provide them with the right and the
correct content and which ones I don't

447
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,870
want them if I don't want them

448
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:16,940
don't block unless they're gonna up to
be does level three

449
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,040
who's next

450
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,180
about time

451
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,419
right on time

452
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,420
left

453
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,340
please

454
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,118
it really depends

455
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:58,320
it's really really depends for some
activity on some of our customer we can

456
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,630
have hundreds for others

457
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:07,530
ten or even less it it depends on the
purpose of it in one case we are seeing

458
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,530
going up close to 1,000

459
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,310
ok

460
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:37,900
yes thank you

461
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,730
the question is about mobility that the
vector a pack of their mobility mobility

462
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,950
is distributed and the usual way to get
to the device you need to go through

463
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:54,370
there to the network to the network
operator operator network all right but

464
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:59,650
as well the device usually the
smartphone has access to the to the

465
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:05,440
internet and do you see any suspicious
vector or interesting vectors of

466
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,750
attracted the mobility are using
probability i know not suspicious

467
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:20,740
declare last week I was analyzing a bot
which was actually it was a about use

468
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:27,009
for scanning and it was fantastic
because in there in the payload

469
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,570
once the cryptid with was based 64 so
easy stuff but once the creepy

470
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:40,780
he said Nick 22 worth negative you know
it's a scanner as well as busybox busy

471
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,920
box is a piece of software that you need
on Android machines to have been routed

472
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,240
if the Android machine is not rooted you
cannot run scanning because you are

473
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,310
prevented from use kind of conduct of
comments on the Android itself so you

474
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,480
first need to read it

475
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,710
using busybox installing busy box and
then you can run something like this boy

476
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:06,640
the or think everybody is being
displayed rather kind of and then Nick

477
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,879
Nick Toby well probably is a is from
deployed but you have also many tools

478
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,970
retracts I like and map or whatever
anyhow

479
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:22,299
yes right the last week I was seen this
coming in but what about the situation

480
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:28,570
to to compromise devices like because
these devices is easy medium right

481
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:34,810
you use the operation that work to
connect to the internet but yeah well

482
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:40,150
this device could be used to attack the
operator natural from the other side

483
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,740
from inside

484
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:48,520
yes and it is this any vector of these
to this kind of of solution

485
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:59,590
yes the reason and for example very
easily if you if you have a tablet or

486
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:04,600
whatever which is rooted which is
enabled for that I I didn't bring it

487
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:11,200
with mine because I needed to fly very
light but it has like on it and you can

488
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,230
run your comments like Lori's like
seizure

489
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:18,880
whatever so you can use that and
actually due to the power that they have

490
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,910
now you can make up a distributed bottom
using that

491
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:33,940
yeah yep it's it's not a scary one like
this gary is but they be imagination of

492
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,300
the of the hackers it's it's it's
amazing

493
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,680
so yeah ok thanks
