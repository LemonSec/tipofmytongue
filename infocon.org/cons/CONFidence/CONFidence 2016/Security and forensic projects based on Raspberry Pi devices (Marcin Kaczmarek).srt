1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:11,440
hello everybody I'm from rocks off road
off center of super computing and

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,349
networking and networking supercomputing
i would like to say something about the

3
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:22,750
small hacking devices but before I start
I would like to show you some real movie

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:29,470
hackers how it look see how hackers in
the movies are strangers

5
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:37,629
look that far looking quite funny how we
know about hackers though you can see

6
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,140
the super Hawking machines

7
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:51,340
of course computers but the proposed of
hackings here so you can see it in the

8
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:51,940
movie

9
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,570
our hacker is if it quicker

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,520
click in the keyboards there's more
powerful hacker and even the clicking

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,820
double her curtains mean to people

12
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,790
clicks as quick as possible and of
course the windows I keep moving around

13
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:16,780
closing opening and so on but of course
that's a really world and so if you want

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:24,159
to be hacker in the movie used to a try
to learn to write in the people as fast

15
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,030
as possible

16
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,869
maybe maybe not ok does short intro i'd
like to serve the public

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,259
the main theme of this presentation is
projects based on raspberry piont such

18
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:43,210
devices which means i would like to
present you some my projects were

19
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,798
paralyzed during my work in the security
and foreign secure area and i would like

20
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,360
to show some really strange devices
which I can't

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:02:00,009
based on this small computer and how it
realized some really strange dust

22
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:05,200
so let's start our main presentation
after the short beginning

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,260
the security of forensic projects by
amazon prosper pie but not only as I

24
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,329
introduced myself much romantic Caeser
from a security information team

25
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,650
fortress internet from Broadway of
technical university and so on

26
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,709
so the agenda is simple what Israel
Raspberry Pi and others week passed and

27
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:29,340
so on

28
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,520
what we have and what we can a few words
about interfaces and thinks what we can

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,750
do with that and about my projects when
I realized during my security and

30
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,140
foreign secure work seems about 10 years
but of course raspberry PI's about two

31
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,790
years experience my experience is about
two years with the raspberry PI's a few

32
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,840
words about process and counts about
these devices and of course

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,840
a what is the future of this devices and
I think that's a goatee is not only

34
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,790
thing we can do about that a lot more a
lot more and that's what at least not

35
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,840
only frequently asked questions about
this if you have some ideas

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,970
if you have some questions about that
I'd like to listen you to listen to us

37
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,670
first of all I would like sorry folks
but I like fools like that so mr. bunny

38
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,920
says this core look like that means i
was outside say something but some basic

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,329
things about it but not only you
probably use them you probably know them

40
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:37,950
the devices but I encouraged to use them
and some ideas here to create some kind

41
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,100
of competitions the competition

42
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,660
what we can do with the rest of a pint
maybe in the next confidence as be a

43
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,420
some kind of competition you pro pro
providers are some ideas to using this

44
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:59,309
in small devices to hacking security and
forensic analysis short intro

45
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,489
what is raspberry pi y Raspberry Pi and
others

46
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,940
the first answer is of course I liken it
small

47
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,980
of course it's small and of course it
smart

48
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,280
they are smarter small using this kind
of devices

49
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:23,070
I could put it in the pocket for example
using deep a portable power bank and

50
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,740
focus i'm using the wife is color in my
pocket

51
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,750
visiting my clients for example and
analyzing what's in the air yes some

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,520
kind of war walking with something that
not only was of course

53
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,250
yes it's linux-based and the next this
of curva somebody there's no yes

54
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,370
when 10 is possible the question is
white

55
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,270
if you like you can do so

56
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,979
the last things of course yes we have a
lot of interfaces with it

57
00:04:52,980 --> 00:05:00,270
yes the fantastic support society and
community if you visit some force for us

58
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,680
a other other places on the web site
dance a lot of information about the

59
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,669
raspberry pi

60
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:11,520
hey yes cool i like to program that was
after this kind of family

61
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,830
yes we can use them there for hacking oh
yes it is open source hardware

62
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,100
could we might be enough so of course
some cans about this some kind of the

63
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,210
day the number of possibility

64
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:36,030
compatible devices such as a bit USB
interfaces but the we have a small and

65
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,679
printed circuit board and ways we can
use the phone and if a interfaces and

66
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,910
devices to connect them and using for
example adding clients so I shot

67
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,140
information about the possibly and
available interfaces that you can see

68
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,030
any the temperature sensor humidity in
size or guess or fires and so optical

69
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,950
sensors and so on so on so on so we get
that a lot of different sensors

70
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,740
different detectors and so on

71
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,280
shot and more so

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,369
so we have our ways small configure the
device device with many interfaces and

73
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,590
sensors and fully programmable access to
the internet or double and

74
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:22,260
compatible with many USB devices not all
but many that good device for hacking

75
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,430
and of course we have gpio where is the
most important part here

76
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,850
I think so we can use for example

77
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,830
Kelly distribution minion distribution
of personally choose to my projects

78
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:42,990
motion pie to some kind of backs some
kind of of course women backs to record

79
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,900
some for example that audio or video the
video we can pump I to some kind of this

80
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,229
similar to cali distribution pump i can
use it

81
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:58,290
of course we can use the Ubuntu holy you
honey pie is to buy a car parts and of

82
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,510
course we have a Python

83
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,960
so we have a smaller Raspberry Pi time
you

84
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:13,680
yeah there's a shot information so back
to the right thing so we can do this of

85
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,730
course other stuff so and now it's felt
something completely different

86
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,490
we cannot just use it Raspberry Pi we
have a different devices such as so or

87
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,530
inch pipe and then up i could be bored

88
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,750
big bomb or draw it or do you know this
is not only could not only some food

89
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,340
fully configured computers but also add
some digital devices we can program for

90
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,039
example or do you know it's not a
linux-based but a based on some gpe

91
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,290
accept lower level programming is a
simpler and of course my size computers

92
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,680
for some hacking work is very popular
and i use them for my usual work for so

93
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,430
for example for reference again security
tasks or do you do it

94
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:03,090
now back to real work hacking and real
hackers what we can do with this strange

95
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,630
about

96
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,280
of course we can use these devices are
protecting devices attacking devices

97
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,479
analyzing devices and of course this
device is really help what about that

98
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,450
interface and things and I mentioned
about gpo before so we have a gpo with

99
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,590
the input total system but not only will
get additional divided additional

100
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,190
interfaces such as to see such as you
are

101
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:36,059
t such as p is so on so we can connect
for example true different other devices

102
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,770
and we can program this device to
connect directly to the chips for

103
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,079
example so we can it be some kind of
interfaces using here for example of

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,940
such things that is like this

105
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,370
testing board and of course we can
connect gif example to analyze a for

106
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,810
sure for about a problem reading bread
chips or something like that and i used

107
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,770
to use the device in my projects for
example to reading the contents of the

108
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,750
memberships using the term different of
course different interfaces and this is

109
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,150
very portable and small so we don't need
to take a laptop or central computers to

110
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:20,160
connect them a to the for example more
chips or something and read the content

111
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,280
of the low-level memory chips for
example of course we can do something

112
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,959
completely different

113
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,350
the enclosures I this app rubber duck

114
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:39,240
so I see the Raspberry Pi in rubber talk
like this color so it's great really is

115
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,160
a really freaky but of course at the
most important part of the main part of

116
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,890
this presentation is projects my
projects often do a few words about that

117
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,069
so we've heard some additional
information

118
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:58,080
you are welcome the first i would like
to present some networks color analyzer

119
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,870
a package injector father on the lower
level intelligence of the video back for

120
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:10,140
recording some in LGA all contents from
for example as a biru rock IP and

121
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,290
directory BTS for analyzing the wifey
structures and analyzing the mobile

122
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,719
phone structures

123
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,009
and of course more to come maybe you
have some ideas

124
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,250
what we can do with this funny devices

125
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:32,000
let's start from metals , monitoring
acting like nobody expects the Spanish

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,779
Inquisition

127
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,189
so we put these devices in for example
in environment and the client permanent

128
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:39,980
it connect to the power connector d

129
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,490
for example an alternative socket in the
wall and white

130
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:50,930
nothing more it can analyze the packets
flow into d all the networks and try to

131
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,989
record using Wi-Fi go to Chicago
something like that and we recording the

132
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,879
USB port for example for the pendrive
about 16 gigabytes or something and I

133
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,089
put this device in my client environment

134
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:08,660
wait for example about eight hours nine
hours

135
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:15,319
just take it up going home and analyze
what is inside the net

136
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:20,899
it's small it's even not mentioned by
for example for the administrators or

137
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:26,930
fortune in pray for the IT guys just
extremely small we can put in for

138
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,339
example on the switch on the firewall or
something like that and of course the

139
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:37,309
power to d pou port from the switches
using the earth or some kind of camping

140
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:41,389
there's no problem and there's nobody
expected so we can

141
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:47,209
nothing to do inside but I put this
little device into environment and watch

142
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,579
what next what will be next

143
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:55,609
a this contains this is based on me
being distribution which is very small

144
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:02,120
the basic into the amazing selection is
about one half gave us but with

145
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,180
additional software such as you see and
map the shark DC be damp and grab the CP

146
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:15,109
flow and of course people even brush it
contains about less than

147
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:23,199
one gigabytes of memory and of course in
this memory of storage memory it

148
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:27,608
so one mention use the USB sticks

149
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:34,299
not the SD card is because not quite
valuable Candace use this a USB ports

150
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:39,040
how to program it of course that's my
project if you want to have some know it

151
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,879
would like to present some more about
that eh

152
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,899
so this network scanner can first and
the last traffic

153
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:55,749
that's the basic function extract
addresses phone is network using some

154
00:12:55,749 --> 00:13:00,609
techniques such as mac address spoofing
such as IP spoofing is something like

155
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:04,329
that but can also scan

156
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:09,910
I to see networks serial interfaces etc
which of course need some additional

157
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:15,429
programming and for example if you easy
using the next generation of the

158
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,899
raspberry pi 3

159
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,559
you can use a ballistic scanning
additional ahead of course we've been

160
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,789
building

161
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:25,989
why free card and additional abilities
enterprise to for example for

162
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:31,839
scalability confirmation but this under
construction now i'm working on that it

163
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,509
to build a bulleted scanner and analyzer
using this device is so you can see that

164
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:47,319
this is a one project and i use them a
system about more than 3 30 times in

165
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:52,599
different locations different clients it
together with the police officers took

166
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,999
for example are not using something and
you see if you can bring without nothing

167
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:58,329
yet

168
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:03,939
I put it in the socket put the pocket go
to the client side and I see

169
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:09,910
ok let's see I put it on the switch or
or by worth something

170
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,699
put in at that and so thank you for much
I will be back tomorrow and get it back

171
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:20,680
so if some mentioned there's something
inside reserves

172
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,969
this is a good situation but about
ninety percent

173
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,529
nobody notice that there's something
inside here so the network scanner

174
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:32,050
working perfectly and I know son

175
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,500
no almost all about inside networks

176
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:42,070
this is some kind of scanner rocks
colors and of course using for example

177
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,149
why fight to analyze a wifey

178
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,700
you can use that the different of course
different different applications such as

179
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:58,149
why fight this matter of great energy
and so on salt working very quite

180
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:04,270
very good to invert the next part is
Beckett injector like product father

181
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:14,470
which mean we have some kind of small
device which provides a housing of the

182
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:21,880
internal network starting from fuzzing
ending low-level a global level packets

183
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,850
for example to checking the internal
floor the of the finals for example to

184
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:35,950
try to exploit some switches and five
words flowing the different kinds of

185
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:44,529
buzzer using a different techniques of
course based on me being his usual using

186
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,209
garcinia and pink

187
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:53,290
scrappy and thanks to microsoft ski come
to emerging for sale up to housing

188
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,010
inside

189
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,930
they're not so there's the expert and of
course is invited to scripting and so on

190
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,529
works just like before

191
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:11,050
plugin wait about two or three seconds
to put and start buzzing yes it's quite

192
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,810
interesting what we have next

193
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,000
if somebody mentions that something you
going on internet work

194
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,390
it's good but it's not always because
the we have no the laptops

195
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:30,550
notebooks are even the android devices
the small devices to put inside the

196
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,550
network inside the rubber rooms and
inserted yourself

197
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:42,400
so the usual room and of course using
the available in a socket and wall and

198
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,829
so once or so we have a injector and
father and of course we can use

199
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,040
applications such as we're careful i
said before

200
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,750
so for example following the websites
passing the internal networks buzzing

201
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,970
ds's tears or something like that

202
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,990
working as the same way as my previous
device

203
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:11,920
so we can put this device inside the
client structure and wait with three

204
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,550
we going does not record anything but
try to some denial of service attack a

205
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:23,649
using the father and analyze what what's
what's going on and checking if some

206
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:30,580
protecting devices from the client cert
react some way to detect this device and

207
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,939
of course example block this this this
traffic

208
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,240
it works fine

209
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:44,140
they using involved i'm using it about
20 locations

210
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,950
buzzers so we can do is I can say that
works perfectly

211
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:57,639
a no additional problems with this for
example there's no a hard disk or

212
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,190
something that it's always always a
content on the USB sticks USB sticks is

213
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,650
such about eight and sixteen gigabytes
of memory and as the cars is used only

214
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,970
for booting the devices

215
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:16,390
I upper operate with the multiple device
based on this you got a nice heard

216
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,830
something about this is possible to
directly from to USB port on the

217
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,809
raspberry country but

218
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:27,220
I don't check it and I don't think it's
if it's working good

219
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:33,429
and in such as but I had something
that's a possibility to put this device

220
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:34,960
from the USB port

221
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,769
the pack and injector of course contains
only raspberry pi is used a stick and if

222
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:47,559
we have a raspberry pi three additional
wifey interface and additional built in

223
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:54,279
precise call also could also fast the
bluetooth devices or Wi-Fi its own using

224
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:57,460
the aircrack-ng of something like that

225
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,990
so this is about the injector and father

226
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,940
the next projects you are working about
is intelligence some kind of intelligent

227
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,649
of the video back

228
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:13,449
sniffer I put this device in the for
example server room

229
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,190
here's a camera inside a camera is of
course

230
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:29,259
infrared ready so we can use for example
additional infrared lamp to pro provides

231
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:37,509
additional a record of course its bait
on mini be on using these software such

232
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,529
as stocks if you know stocks check the
weather sucks is I guess as a kind of

233
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:47,289
intelligent all the processing not only
for recording and example transfer into

234
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,710
the very good combination of the other
sounds

235
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,299
but also recorded and start recalled
when the signal comes the emotion

236
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:01,899
emotion application is to record a video
port for using the internal camera

237
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:09,580
it is capable to a and I was about four
cameras at once and check it

238
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:16,360
including the internal device internal
camera so recording it of course works

239
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,299
are some kind of web stream week

240
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:23,918
this is no different record and stream
and to the website you can access to the

241
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,369
divided to the device through for
example Wi-Fi in the observation

242
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,660
what is inside the server room for
example and of course we can break the

243
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,010
true -

244
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,920
interactivity if it's possibly so i put
the device in the into the client

245
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,120
environment

246
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,689
it puts about two or three seconds

247
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:49,870
quick but and start to record audio and
video is so i can connect for example

248
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:55,689
from the external locations such as
under him for money out of building or

249
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,560
down those from the from the other
building and try to connect to the Wi-Fi

250
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,210
and of course we observe a what's what's
going on inside

251
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:14,020
so this a can do audio can do video can
both it it gets it can even do more for

252
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,270
example provides some information about
temperature about a humidity

253
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:26,470
if we use them for example a sari for
example additional interface such as for

254
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,750
example a humidity and temperatures and
so which I have it here and provide the

255
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,280
complete information about the
environment which is what intelligent

256
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:43,180
Barker's of course we can detect both
this is that recording devices related

257
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:49,660
to the physical security not only the a
internal security and the most

258
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:55,480
interesting part with the raspberry pi
is rug devices devices with historic

259
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,360
devices as a force ap on false

260
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:06,370
BTS has dimension I'd like to mention
that's about two hours ago I was provide

261
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,600
additional a confidence work I p

262
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,250
I think that's some kind of record today
how many clients can connect to this

263
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,250
therapy not to the right to confidence

264
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,429
is CID I check it working

265
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:31,930
just simple just can't the air and
analyze the a/s/l IDs and provide a

266
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,930
rogue AP to catch clients is as simple
as hell

267
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:41,410
we're using your driving or walking in
pocket using the power bank or something

268
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,920
or cycling also and if the jury in the
future

269
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,540
it's possible were flying using drones
for example if we used a raspberry pi

270
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,940
rho x p2

271
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,800
for example fly over the location and
try to catch the clients or and of

272
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:04,780
course can work as a jammer to do Wi-Fi
device for example we need some stuff

273
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,928
like provide app as many as possible

274
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:13,990
ccid can act as a jammer for Wi-Fi and
it looks like here some here projects

275
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:20,050
but not my products a small with antenna
for example in India legal or illegal

276
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,590
bass interested in something like that
and drug IP

277
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,670
what is the process of this it can put
in 23 seconds as well and of course

278
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,809
provide a complete information about the
clients which is connected to d this

279
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:39,399
device and collect as much information
suppose it's possible to for example a

280
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,040
record the traffic inside using white
shark shark or something like that for

281
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,159
future analyzes as i said before is
called about it in a museum

282
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,320
aircrack-ng or kismet to the for that
said the group and wait just wait

283
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,879
of course collectors information so this
is about the rogue AP the next is more

284
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,110
complicated

285
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,110
the question is what is death who knows

286
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,959
let's go stink ray - who knows about
that

287
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:21,900
yes it's all bs what's the purpose of
that of course to collect the all gsm

288
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,640
traffic's to this device but this is a
very problem with it

289
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,940
what is the problem with that no the
price

290
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:36,930
the prize is about I have something
about ten thousand dollars or more and

291
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:42,600
is back government to sniff the gsm
traffic's for example 5 police or FBI or

292
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,679
something like that

293
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:52,680
NSA so of course we can buy it but I was
not quite necessary to buy provided ten

294
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,180
thousand dollars for example even more
to do to construct this device and we

295
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:05,220
can use the small matter of course not
only to provide a some kind of BTS

296
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:12,090
husband can write more about BTS working
phones and let's go to look how Jesus

297
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,040
marks works

298
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,370
probably you know as the BTS now bc MSC
and so on so on the communication the

299
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:28,439
first thing is of course pts so we can
attack the gsm network here and the BTS

300
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,020
and provide some kind of force ap and
it's like to connect to do for to this

301
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,210
spot and of course we can use their some
kind of men in the middle attack to

302
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,170
provide the food for communication or
just block the communication this is

303
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:49,740
about for example even know why we have
a phone and you can connect to the horse

304
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:56,040
BTS can never know about this disorder
is a connection is released but we you

305
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,889
know is this force or right BTS

306
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:04,110
so the man in the video attic and
general mark was very and have to detect

307
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:11,040
from the phone but of course the future
net worth of treatment was using the

308
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,899
additional protection is not quite
possible but working on it

309
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:24,030
maybe in the next projects include so a
the previous device goes to 10,000 or

310
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:29,820
more dollars and this is d a card but it
can act as a diaz device which costs

311
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,300
only about four hundred dollars

312
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,389
yeah so we can use it

313
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:43,830
it is called blade arrived and the blade
of software a using the radio module and

314
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:49,800
the producers new end and of course can
tune from you can see a 300 megahertz

315
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,129
238 gigahertz of course need it

316
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,640
of course we need antennas for that

317
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,970
and of course we need a raspberry pi 3
or even our spirit be true to control

318
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:10,230
this is a cardinal eyes and of course
working as a GS and I pack of software i

319
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:16,380
would like to show you how it works but
the chinese producers cannot send it to

320
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,260
me before this country dance so

321
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,270
hey maybe next time i would like to show
you the power of the rock BTS how to

322
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:29,340
collect the all communication real
estate to the gsm and i would like to

323
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,939
present

324
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:36,060
how it look how it works maybe a if you
want to some check how it works and how

325
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,290
it could be connected to the network
into using the different

326
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:48,650
the phones excluding the 3g or UTM I and
something like that only works on gsm

327
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:53,690
level but I'm working on it to the work
working on the highest level for example

328
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,850
edge or something

329
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:03,110
so the total cost about these rogue BTS
is not 10,000 doors and we can slow down

330
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:09,199
slow down to go down to the about 11
half and thousand dollars that's why

331
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,940
like this device

332
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,170
how it looks it looks like that you can
see and raspberry pi

333
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:20,900
you can see the foreign power source
here can pass those there's burp I

334
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,450
controlled the these cards and using
their abilities as you can see it's too

335
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,340
just like the suitcase and just like
down more in the suitcase and working

336
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,860
around with the rocker BTS could do it
looks

337
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,959
hey what is the purpose of course
management strategies in networks

338
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,770
the next part is next project was
awakened now so worried about them is a

339
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:55,730
tow something down on

340
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,100
yeah yes yes this Monty Python

341
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,100
yeah you know I like them

342
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:09,490
those guys who raspberry Python provides
is so back to the back to the

343
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:17,049
presentation BTS and the next is the
next is a ballistics color so as some

344
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:18,399
kind of broke

345
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,820
bluetooth device so we can do you say it

346
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:29,110
of course the professional device
available and at the coast about 5,000

347
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:34,418
or 6,000 dollars or even a cheaper you
can you scan a bluetooth thing a

348
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:39,730
bluetooth device and analyzed the
communication between but as you can

349
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,350
probably know there

350
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:46,539
Rosberg 3 has a booty to the model
inside so it needs only the proper

351
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:48,429
software which may be good

352
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:54,610
sure available soon so we can scan the
bluetooth devices such as a scare

353
00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:00,939
Wi-Fi and such as their gsm so we can
see that the small devices can do

354
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:08,080
anything I want to we want to do against
the protecting attacking and analyzing

355
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,529
networks and the idea for some kind of
competition to create the ideas to

356
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:19,899
create some interesting projects based
on the raspberry pi will go so i think

357
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:24,908
that the next confidence will be some
kind of competition to analyze your

358
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:31,360
projects based on this small devices and
maybe even some questions about this

359
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,408
of course about the interface is
something that the part of the equation

360
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,549
are we after the presentation blue think
of course

361
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:46,480
so in it so we have Wi-Fi so we have a
gsm so we have a bluetooth

362
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,840
maybe a turnout of course is billion so
that the government mention ok

363
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,919
so let's through as about President
concert with advances the process of

364
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,230
course small reliable per table

365
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:07,620
easy power only five votes on about two
Emperor's fully programmable quick start

366
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,699
just seconds and go and of course the
device have some cards

367
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:20,190
sometimes it's slow yes sometimes not
quite efficient if for example in some

368
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:28,290
task the the power of the internal for
core processor is not enough for example

369
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,639
if we provide some kind of thing client
who through websites

370
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,960
browsing at something like that it can
be slow

371
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,180
it can be quite not efficient but
sometimes depends on what we want to do

372
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:50,700
with that a yes but this also teach the
other devices does not fully supported

373
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,190
by some devices too especially drivers
for some USB devices but we working out

374
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:01,770
that help but not least sometimes
sometimes get hurt because i didn't

375
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:07,920
mention a some some information about
the Internet stocks day was very three

376
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:15,690
under the high level of and the great
can grow to about 100 degrees of Celsius

377
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:19,800
but I don't mention but is what yes it's
warm but not hot

378
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:29,460
maybe some but of course I provide the
additional protection using the simple

379
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:37,410
radiator mounted on the on the main
treatment processes so so the present

380
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,509
cause

381
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:45,109
the birthday the clue is yes i still
like him and we have the still something

382
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:46,579
to do with them

383
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:52,009
and of course this is open source you
can do anything you want to do with them

384
00:32:53,449 --> 00:33:03,859
i have about 60 for raspberry PI's by my
side and about 30 different operating

385
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:09,468
system . 30 different projects is a few
of them but I can talk about the for

386
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:11,100
example VPN

387
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:20,189
just as VP and connectors some kind of
protection working as a piece working as

388
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,690
a VPN a piece and so on so on so on but
this is more than the simple projects

389
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,100
reason to go

390
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,918
I can centralize some as some ways to
construct the devices been based on

391
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,360
these computers from the security and
foreign sequence of you

392
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:43,139
for example another project what I
realized is a quick repair of the a

393
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:52,440
quick copy of the disk storage using
this to port through is reports as a SI

394
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,070
t ssit interfaces and connect to disk

395
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:03,090
- D the Carpenters little bit copies of
the two two discs and also can be used

396
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:11,909
so that this is the open Word of on
hardware and upward to more projects not

397
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:17,909
only microsoft based but off between
spaced so we can do anything we want to

398
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,109
do so

399
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:23,909
the last not my question is what's the
future

400
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:32,369
somebody says no future of this devices
and that but the future is nears we

401
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:39,780
still waiting for raspberry fall and the
community information is that what we

402
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,830
need

403
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:45,629
under next devices so do you want
something more is of course

404
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:52,590
so what we really want first is USB boot
ink to directly putting from the USB

405
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:58,020
sticks not only be using the SD card
socket could be possible

406
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:04,619
I'm not check it in the respiratory we
need more ram or just some kind of their

407
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:10,260
sockets on the raspberry the kind of
circuit using in the portable computers

408
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,990
three halves for example of you

409
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,790
we do need more ram there's a problem
really here in this device is not

410
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,420
possible to expand the internal ram but
if we

411
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:28,900
and the raspberry p might meet the team
soccer that could be possible to provide

412
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,750
as many men as we can for example neat
and of course SATA interfaces

413
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,670
this is available on different versions
of the raspberry animation before orange

414
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,380
by mmm

415
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:46,750
beaglebone something that is the a lot
of configuration options here

416
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,440
the processors the internal devices

417
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,630
you know SATA interfaces other
interfaces but the most important parts

418
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:00,910
of course the gpio which can be used in
the low-level detecting the device and

419
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:06,129
love and hacking device using the some
stuff like provided by security security

420
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:11,230
action IOT breaking the IOT devices are
or even the breaking day a low-level

421
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,550
chip for example due to read the
contents of the children Morris using

422
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:22,870
the dif different in additional
interfaces so not only frequently -

423
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:28,210
guess since the questions of course a
lot of questions

424
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:34,360
the first of course what is your
favorite color but the micro is black is

425
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,280
wrong have the technical questions about
my projects / having any questions about

426
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:46,870
the future products i would like to show
you some operation of a but have not

427
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:53,259
read quick short time to death but if
you want two more information is of

428
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,130
course we can talk a about this

429
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,559
so we have any questions about these

430
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:04,989
the presentations please ask and you
have any ideas regarding this interval

431
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:10,689
or even you provide some interesting
projects using the raspberrypi a here my

432
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:17,049
friends want to say something about that
you can show you a small device as bears

433
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:22,599
on the raspberry 3 or 2 3 is ok

434
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,140
yes and also something completely
different do you remember the what the

435
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,129
guys in red

436
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,449
tell nobody expect

437
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:35,559
exactly and you're the winner

438
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:42,339
and you will get a raspberry free in the
conflict with the SD card and supposedly

439
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:47,319
yes this is possible by is a pollen the
nonprofit organization and we start

440
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:52,869
project about about the raspberry pi so
if somebody want to join to our project

441
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:59,289
also this is another way to mention the
the property to not afraid to ask any

442
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:03,789
questions yes that's how we can use the
example one day when the deer alberta by

443
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:07,539
the of course it's very powerful

444
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:13,928
of course it's cheap yeah as does the
most most most pros of this device is a

445
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:18,009
cheap and very relatable and comfortable
with this a this

446
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:21,670
so if you have any ideas you're welcome

447
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,819
maybe we have something for you more or
maybe not

448
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:32,079
yes of course there's a lot more
projects based on the raspberry devices

449
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,170
or even the

450
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,170
I mentioned the heart because they're or
droid or something like that

451
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:42,380
even you made those devices on this on
the station of the security securing

452
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,799
here using this device to control
something

453
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:51,020
of course we can use this raspberry pi
to control it I see that they control in

454
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,400
the drones in the controlling the robots
or something like that but is not

455
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,869
related to security

456
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:02,240
maybe or not it concentrated security
yes yes of course this is a cool device

457
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:11,299
i use about 64 sin saber 64 device in my
side even to realize different tasks

458
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:18,230
such even as a server search is it using
the mortgage application to control the

459
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,160
home

460
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:25,190
yes of course it's been able two
different acts which is discussed before

461
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:33,200
so we can use for example to watch TV
using deep and dvb-t enterprise and so

462
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,819
on so on so the growing number of
different levels different level

463
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:41,119
projects different levels different
events of applications different things

464
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,420
of the of the small device which is easy
to put in the pocket use it using the

465
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,790
power bank profitable

466
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:55,609
you can for example I i would like to
mention I have a car and the car week

467
00:39:55,609 --> 00:40:00,650
I get that three raspberries three
devices for controlling d internal on

468
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,700
the

469
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:07,640
the electronics in the car and even the
record some from the cameras from the

470
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,259
first from the in forward and from the
backwards

471
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:17,810
- for example if I want to know what is
going with my car could just connect to

472
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:21,500
the Wi-Fi to the current checking
everything is great for something

473
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,500
somebody somebody guys who wants to for
example

474
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,820
yeah so my tires or something like that
but of course it works inside

475
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,600
it's not quite make it very program like
very very flexible to the program so i

476
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,779
encourage you to use this device to
provide some your own projects and I

477
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:47,570
think that idea of competition and the
next and the next to em it confidence is

478
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:54,440
to provide some kind of call em a window
something through when if you provide us

479
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,870
a very fine projects about this is very
devices i'd like to it

480
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:06,470
so thank you for your patience I want to
be bearing may be boring so I think

481
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:11,839
about sorry about that but i would like
to mention the idea of my source

482
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,300
hardware is very open

483
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:20,480
so nobody expected we can do with the
small boxes and it works

484
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:28,850
short briefly and the additional
questions ideas welcome and the problems

485
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:35,150
of course we can discuss if you have a
sum two additional information maybe you

486
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:41,150
provide this or similar projects we've
been working at that

487
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:47,480
I think that the future market of of
this kind of devices and open and really

488
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,130
open for the security in forensic
projects based on that and as a hacker's

489
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:56,540
we need to know everything about that
and this simple because this simple

490
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,190
australia is small it

491
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:07,540
some guys to me that that a possibility
of some kind of vulnerability inside the

492
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,509
microprocessor use it

493
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:18,069
maybe maybe not I just check it i just
checked this this inside the you know

494
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:24,040
what is what is inside the processor and
nothing nothing k batteries and all of

495
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:30,759
course there's no by OS there is no
additional additional application site

496
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:37,750
we can put directly from the SD card or
USB sticks so please use them

497
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,319
does all from my side thank you very
much

498
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,010
and yes you can show how it works here

499
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:54,849
thanks to France I have no ideas but yes
it's fully operation computer-based yes

500
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:56,020
Callie looks me

501
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:01,089
I i put inside my pocket go to the
server room and what what what you can

502
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:04,630
do it say analyze it anything going to
want to thank you very much

503
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:05,770
you're welcome
