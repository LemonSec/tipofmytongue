1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,190
so good morning everyone welcome to my

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,550
talk into the the returns of

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,619
Icefall apt so Who am I my name is Chan

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,689
Chan I'm from Taiwan so this is a

5
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,000
Chinese name and then I know this is

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,210
very hard to remember so you can just

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,740
call me Ashley I'm currently a senior

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,420
researcher working in fireEye

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,970
intelligence collections and the

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,430
research team and in my spare time I

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,129
like to join community events so I'm

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,890
also the co-founder of community coha

13
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,839
Congress this is a security community in

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,680
Taiwan supporting woman to join the

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,100
cybersecurity industry and also

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:56,370
currently serve in some review board of

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,800
several conference and also this is my

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:04,190
first time in Poland and first client

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,190
confidence come on show some support

20
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:10,830
thank you so how does this research get

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,920
started the stories start from our

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,220
day-to-day job as a researcher which is

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,040
reading tweet and it's now a source of

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,289
intelligence that we call Twitter and

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,020
one day one of the tweet call my

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,180
attentions this is the clear skies

27
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,880
Twitter account they shares a sample

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,830
suspected target in Kurdistan and the

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,970
samples is the exploit document which

30
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:39,750
embedded a decoy with a thin with Winter

31
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,140
Olympic content and before I saw this

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,540
tweet

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,790
I was also analyzing these samples and I

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,850
have some concern about attribution of

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,920
these samples which you will understand

36
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,699
why if you don't with me until the end

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,110
and then I saw Brian who is a great

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,780
researcher but I never know how to

39
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:01,530
pronounce his last name mentioned the

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,630
same concern as me he said I wouldn't

41
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,420
need to equate to call this ice for the

42
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,699
group they are potentially multiple

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,120
groups using this based on different

44
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:16,140
region language and respond

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,720
responsibility so I know now you must be

46
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,970
wondering what is ice fog why are you

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,370
talking about so here's a little bit

48
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,580
background about ice for

49
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,040
in 2013 Kaspersky published a

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,410
comprehensive report about a targeted

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,510
attack campaign leverage of our two

52
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:38,670
targets US Japan Taiwan and South Korea

53
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:41,280
Nomura is Nantz ice fog is is using the

54
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,730
word observe in the CNC domains and it

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,110
is also has has another name than

56
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,260
Tsukuba it's probably in them by

57
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,380
Japanese I think the campaign detail in

58
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,530
the rapport was to placed between 2011

59
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,230
and 2013 and everything's after the

60
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,830
report publish now we frequently see

61
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,660
people refer to ice far as a malware

62
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,510
sometimes as a report but sometimes also

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,799
referred as the group however is it

64
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,899
really a group here's the problem if you

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,050
try to search on Google about ice fault

66
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,660
you will find a late last public report

67
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,650
latest probably a report on ice for was

68
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,810
in 2013 and 2014 and after the report

69
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,730
published by Kaspersky there's no new

70
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,280
report and research detail any new

71
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,100
campaigns about this about the new

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,680
campaign in these fires and of course

73
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,410
they are fields or tweets or samples

74
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,330
analysis on the ice form our there on

75
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,280
any campaign tracking and they mostly

76
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,380
just attribute these new samples to the

77
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,500
old group that hold the campaigns in

78
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,810
2013 but are they really from the same

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,230
group so attacker the reason why I'm

80
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,970
asking is because the latest samples we

81
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,010
observe are targeting completely

82
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,780
different countries and region also

83
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,000
there are some change to the mirror and

84
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,850
the techniques have been using the

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,250
attacks are change therefore I decided

86
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,590
to conduct a deep analysis research on

87
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,110
the ice for campaigns and try to figure

88
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,940
out what happened in these fires and

89
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,209
what has been changed and unchanged

90
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,540
and are these the new samples came from

91
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:22,130
the same attackers in 2013 or they are

92
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,800
new attackers using these tools nowadays

93
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,290
so now I know some of you my wondering

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,310
why do I care about which attackers are

95
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,540
using this mirror and if you have ever

96
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,150
participating and if their intelligence

97
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,230
talk you might be here

98
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,210
of this famous cool functions and he's

99
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,040
he talked about know your enemy and know

100
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,010
yourself then you will always speak

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,620
betrayed but now I figured out a better

102
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,289
way to describe it if we have watch

103
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,170
Pokemon which I would be surprised if

104
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,810
you haven't you will know what ash do

105
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,580
when he met a new Pokemon for the first

106
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,830
time he would take care of the pocket

107
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,169
acts to understand what the capability

108
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,390
of this Pokemon has and pick out the

109
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,580
right Pokemon to fight battle this is

110
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,310
why we should understand the Pokemon I

111
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,800
mean the actor the attacker that we are

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,020
facing so we will know were they

113
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,630
targeting and what kind of tools

114
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,440
what kind of defense method should I use

115
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:23,870
to face this Pokemon I mean the actor so

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,370
I think I don't need to explain more for

117
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,860
this concept if you understand the

118
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,560
functions of Architects it is the same

119
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,220
as the kissing contrasts the concept of

120
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,620
the threat intelligence so now how do I

121
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,120
start the research because I want to

122
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,510
understand what has changed between

123
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,180
these fires and what has been changed I

124
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,430
need to collect data to do the analysis

125
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,460
and these data are the samples deploy in

126
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,040
the attacks and I need as much as

127
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,440
samples as I can it is not a secret that

128
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,450
every Mehra researchers are doing

129
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,390
hunting on the public fire scanning

130
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:02,240
service and aside from public affair a

131
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:05,000
scanning service in fire we also have

132
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,400
appliance that do the detections so

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
there's also wonderful sample sources

134
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,310
and for hunting samples they are several

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,440
characteristic can be used for hunting

136
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,440
including the strings in the malware

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,010
which sounds pretty simple but it's

138
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,680
usually very effective also the malware

139
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,420
function usually need to reverse chimera

140
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,400
and get the unique functions and

141
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,530
sometimes merit developer they will

142
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,640
include some debug informations in the

143
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,440
mirror that can also use for hunting and

144
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,690
beside housing the characteristic of the

145
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,880
mirror itself we also try to home for

146
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,190
the exploit template and there are some

147
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,670
people with this method which I will

148
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,360
expand it later and hunting this always

149
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,300
a cycle with the

150
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,030
we got front hunting we extract the ILC

151
00:06:51,300 --> 00:07:00,210
and then we can pivot on the CNC to see

152
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:02,250
if we can find more samples so iPhone is

153
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,378
kind of special because it has eight

154
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:08,039
kind of different variants which are

155
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:09,780
disclosed before 2014 for each type

156
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,719
there are some difference between the

157
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,938
communication methods the most common

158
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:18,150
variants are their type one and the type

159
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:20,310
ng variants I spawned not only has the

160
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,280
window space it also has the Mac OS

161
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,169
version and the Java version the Mac OS

162
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,929
version was the only variants they are

163
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:30,960
public available it has been unser

164
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,979
distributed in some foreign Chinese form

165
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,739
in 2013 however why with these sound

166
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:40,889
samples when we define some samples

167
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,050
during hunting of the Mac version they

168
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,360
don't look like the actual sample that

169
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,610
deploy in the attack because the CNC

170
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,810
server are mostly the default setting or

171
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:55,740
the private IP so we don't think so by

172
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,719
now we didn't observe any actual Mac OS

173
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,110
version sample using the actual attack

174
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:04,199
and Oda size four variants have the very

175
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:06,719
very basic backdoor function supported

176
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,300
including upload download executing

177
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:14,759
comments and the code comment is for

178
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:16,860
loading a specific file and this slide

179
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,319
is showing some unique streets in some

180
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,009
ice for variants that can be used for

181
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,750
hunting so in the very early old Ice

182
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,729
Bowl samples they didn't do any

183
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,279
authenticated to those strings so you

184
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,409
can see from the screenshot there it's

185
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,448
very obvious this is the traffic

186
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:37,500
patterns including some victims

187
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:40,380
informations IP user directly assistant

188
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,860
directory language this information will

189
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,560
be sent to the CNC server and also the

190
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,050
extra keys is one of the unique string

191
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,939
that can be used for hunting and for the

192
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,399
old ice fog malware because it can

193
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,100
communicate with the CNC server wither

194
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,040
email account so you can easily file

195
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,920
sound special string about the email in

196
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,410
the malware and also for type 2

197
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,709
because it has is its communicates with

198
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:10,019
some SP tonight script so you can see

199
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:13,410
this kind of string in them our two but

200
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:15,570
the most recognizable strings in this

201
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,790
power and this is actually using this

202
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,760
string this is how I found a new Marin

203
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:25,139
is the string in the iSchool type one

204
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,970
there's a very typical string of traffic

205
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:29,610
pattern which is a file past and found

206
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,519
ants this is a very typical traffic

207
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,880
patterns of eisbock and well in the

208
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,620
later variants that all a lot of these

209
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,470
strings has been changed because it's

210
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,010
easy to change but this travel travel

211
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,480
pattern didn't change so for a hunting

212
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,029
sound of the method used foreign

213
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,410
Christians are pretty helpful in most of

214
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,660
the variants they are functions to

215
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,819
increase data transfer to CNC server and

216
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,579
this encryption usually involved unique

217
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,529
keys and logic for example you can see

218
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:02,219
the XOR key and function in this

219
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:09,269
screenshot from Icefall ng and OS also

220
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:12,149
the OSX version and also the type 1 so

221
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:14,430
in 2018 we start to observe attacker to

222
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:18,240
the advantage of the Microsoft document

223
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:21,510
exploitation 2017 1 1 a2 to deploy the

224
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,209
Icefall payload and we notice that most

225
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,670
of the Icefall samples was dropped by

226
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,040
the same exploit template which has the

227
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,130
same metadata and use the same shackle

228
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,339
to drop the malware when user opened the

229
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:38,089
exploit document an encoded dropper will

230
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:40,140
be dropped into the temp folder and upon

231
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,320
exploitation the show code will be

232
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,180
executed and decode the encoded dropper

233
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,990
and the dropper will drop the final

234
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:52,469
payload the dropper usually contains the

235
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,120
the final payload but it's not always I

236
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,579
spoke I will explain it later

237
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,459
there are two different ways that we can

238
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:02,359
hunt for this expand exploit document

239
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:05,250
samples one is to recognize the embedded

240
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,339
object dimensions that he please share

241
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:11,060
among the exploit template another

242
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,829
method is to hunt for the

243
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,630
its home for the show called tickles

244
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:18,959
routine they use in the

245
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:21,509
expert template there is a research from

246
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,189
animalist they have a great analysis on

247
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:26,190
this exploit template so if you are

248
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:30,600
interested you can try to look at this

249
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:32,699
research and however this hunting method

250
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,370
is the pitfall needs to be noticed

251
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:37,500
because with further research we

252
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,810
realized that although this template is

253
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,899
not public available and quite unique

254
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:46,040
this is actually sure amongst different

255
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:49,019
attacker groups including APD forty

256
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,839
condiments team also known as gobbling

257
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,360
Panda and also the Icefall operator in

258
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,339
this table at least some samples that we

259
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,170
observe that are used by different

260
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:01,440
attacker groups but they are all the

261
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,870
same templates for example that sample

262
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,420
used by a TD 40 the usually drop pig and

263
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,630
malware and usually target the US and

264
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,000
the samples drop used by economists team

265
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,819
usually drop 10 fund and targets via

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,649
Nance mostly so the reason why we think

267
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:19,019
they are used by different attacker

268
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,850
groups is because this template usually

269
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,250
dropped different kinds of malware and

270
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,199
target total a different region and the

271
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,050
infrastructure connected by the memory

272
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,969
is totally complete different couldn't

273
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,519
be connected and the TTP

274
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,829
in other samples also somehow different

275
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,350
so this is why we think that this

276
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:39,300
template is actually sure by different

277
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,459
attacker groups but this is the peaceful

278
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,410
for attribution because I have seen some

279
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,349
blog they analyze on I suppose sample

280
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:49,819
and say oh this is Kannamma Steam but no

281
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,380
this is actually two different groups so

282
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:56,009
attributed based on just only the sample

283
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:58,319
is kind of dangerous so with a both

284
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:00,569
mentioned hunting method in addition to

285
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,639
the no ice for variants I was able to

286
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:05,849
find two new variants which appears

287
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,449
after 2014 and also being deployed in

288
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,430
the campaign between 2014 and 2018 these

289
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:13,769
two variants are similar in terms of the

290
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,660
functionality however they use different

291
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,269
communication protocol to come back to

292
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,089
CNC server because these two variants

293
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:23,430
are new were new newly discovered so it

294
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:26,279
didn't have a time and so I just give it

295
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,520
a time then one is called ice for P and

296
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:32,040
1 skål eyes for M and I thought P was

297
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,850
first observe in 2014 and M is the

298
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,699
latest observe in 2018 also the ice for

299
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:43,560
M variance has become Fowler's it is

300
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:46,530
existing as the show coal so what's new

301
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,869
in this ice 4p comparing with the old

302
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,730
ice for samples this variant support

303
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,910
more comments that make it more complete

304
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,640
back door in a super comment to screen

305
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:59,969
you directly terminate current threat

306
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:03,689
text screenshot Sankey log data rename

307
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,520
files etc the main function is actually

308
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,710
very easy to locate when you are doing

309
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,600
reversing because it's very gently

310
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:13,710
remind you that this is the main

311
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:18,840
function with a bootable string and also

312
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:22,110
in the Icefall P variant there is a wear

313
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,670
logic that would be for entering the

314
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,220
main function it will try to determine

315
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:30,569
the current date time and see if this is

316
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:34,140
before May 6 2013 why do I say this is

317
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:37,110
where because the earliest ice for P

318
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:41,130
sample was discovered in 2014 but the

319
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:44,340
date was in 2013 so my hypothesis is

320
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:47,460
probably this is the way in 2014 they

321
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:50,250
try to identify the analysis environment

322
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,940
or an T sandbox and even in a new world

323
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,830
in 2018 they didn't changes because they

324
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,750
just copy the old code and then dear

325
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:02,640
modified it and the new ice for variants

326
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,920
also adds a lot information into the

327
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,180
traffic send over to CNC server it

328
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:13,260
includes OS version CPU data physical

329
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:16,770
memory hard disk cd-rom take space and

330
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:20,100
these are apparently for attacker to

331
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:23,970
filter out the analysis analysis

332
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,130
environment another new capability

333
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,860
actually new variants is the function to

334
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:32,090
collect Windows and browser credentials

335
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,410
for browser a support Firefox and Chrome

336
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,540
the code in these functions are

337
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,839
apparently copied from the open stores

338
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:42,189
called project for dumping windows Paris

339
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,230
were it just used a cold front F

340
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,510
you dumb project and for the functions

341
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,830
to collect Firefox credential it used

342
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:51,910
the code downloaded from the website

343
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:55,240
then security exploded this code need to

344
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,520
load an external sqlite3 library to

345
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,680
carry the password so some of the

346
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,770
Icefall piece variants were embedded

347
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,430
some sqlite3 functions in the library in

348
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:08,650
the binary IMing and one of the

349
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,989
interesting feature support in the new

350
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:14,800
variants is the functions to monitor

351
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:18,070
specific folder the command takes lists

352
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,189
it was safe a directory a list into a

353
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,440
file and then after it's safe the list

354
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,690
there is another function they will

355
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,870
monitor the directory change with the

356
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:32,560
API read directly change and then save

357
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:35,920
the locks into another file and the lock

358
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:39,569
will be safe into this format and then

359
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:43,180
when attacker give the command takes lot

360
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:45,730
expect or will send the log data to C&C

361
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:52,209
server with this specific traffic

362
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:54,520
pattern which mimic as a jpg file the

363
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,470
second Icefall variants Icefall m

364
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,960
basically support the same functionality

365
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,150
as ice for p the difference is is it

366
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,420
encrypted traffic by communicate with

367
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:06,879
cnc through HTTP protocol and the pay

368
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,160
the payload become families the payload

369
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,530
is usually encrypted and write into the

370
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,290
register key pray by a stroke owing

371
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,869
exploit document it is usually deployed

372
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,938
with a customized loader which will

373
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,550
query the register key and decree and

374
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:24,790
run the payload in memory to reduce the

375
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:29,139
size of the malware they have an

376
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:32,290
external sqlite3 library we will drop a

377
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,570
drug with by the dropper and then the

378
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:39,370
show call will load this library in

379
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:41,439
during execution so after collecting all

380
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,669
these samples let's look at the PDB

381
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,600
string of this Maur

382
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:49,240
we constantly observe a man JD shows up

383
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:53,290
in the old sample Icefall type 1 and

384
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,179
type 2 before 2013 so it seems like JD

385
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,489
is probably a developer

386
00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:02,710
and there's also another usin and

387
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:06,879
Young's easy but after 2013 all the

388
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:09,879
Icefall P Farren's has very different PD

389
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:14,080
B string and many other nails like Apple

390
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:16,629
chin chosing the other PD using this

391
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,408
Ferren so it probably indicates that

392
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:24,759
after 2013 there are more developers are

393
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:27,249
maintaining this power to better

394
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,349
understand the uses of each parents I

395
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:31,899
analyzed the compile time stand of the

396
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:33,939
collecting samples the Icefall am

397
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:36,488
variant is file is choco so the

398
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,399
comparison is extracted from the loader

399
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:41,889
and from this graph we can see that

400
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:44,199
basically after 2014

401
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:46,599
attackers seems to abandon all the

402
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,330
Icefall old variants including the old

403
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:52,479
one type 1 type 2 and ng all disappeared

404
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,428
after 2014 and start from 2014 they

405
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:57,729
switched completely to the iceberg p

406
00:18:54,429 --> 00:19:01,659
variants and in 2018 they start to use

407
00:18:57,729 --> 00:19:04,359
the ice for and parent and this graph

408
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:06,609
shows the compound stem distribution for

409
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:10,418
each years and you can see the sample

410
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:13,629
numbers are relatively high between 2011

411
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:15,940
and 2013 and interestingly after

412
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:20,619
Kaspersky published their report in

413
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:23,559
September 2019 in the next few moment

414
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:27,129
and 13 we didn't observe any samples

415
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:29,289
compiled in this period and in 2014

416
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:31,468
we'll start to observe a small amount of

417
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:35,919
sample but the stemple number is still

418
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:37,899
dramatically drop and 2015 they start to

419
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,489
bore a little bit 16 grow a little bit

420
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:42,728
but we couldn't find any samples

421
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:46,239
compiled in 2017 with unknown reasons

422
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:50,169
then in 2018 the numbers are increased

423
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:52,479
again and it's more than 2016 so this

424
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:54,580
wrath gives us a brisk image on the

425
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:56,769
number of attack leverage ice fall in

426
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,168
each year however the number could be

427
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:01,749
affected by several factors for example

428
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:04,659
the same competence then share with the

429
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:07,749
merit dropper or wrapper also some time

430
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:08,880
attacker might use the sample compare

431
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:11,730
before in the new

432
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,650
so to determine the actual sample number

433
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:17,220
deploying each year which we need to

434
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:19,380
consider more ties them so how do we

435
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,660
determine the time Stendhal each samples

436
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,150
as I mentioned it would not be just by

437
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,490
the composite I stand of the binary in

438
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,580
fact we need to consider multiple factor

439
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,670
including the CNC passes dnf'd

440
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,429
Tyson the domain creation dates the drop

441
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:38,010
per comp out i standed exploit document

442
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:41,070
i stan and sometimes also the decoy file

443
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,490
ties them also sometimes in pdb strain

444
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,470
there will be updates that attacker left

445
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,510
below is one of the example showing why

446
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,030
we shouldn't just judge by the

447
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,070
competence them so this sample is

448
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:56,730
interesting because the oldest timestamp

449
00:20:53,070 --> 00:21:01,590
is in 2014 the exploit document was less

450
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:05,250
safe on 2014 however the sample was

451
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:09,179
itself it's compiled in 2016 but then

452
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:11,640
the symbol was officer in 2017 717 and

453
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,350
also the CNC Pasadena's shows that the

454
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,430
domain was resolved to the server in

455
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:19,620
2017 most importantly that ties them in

456
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:23,130
the decoy file dropped by these samples

457
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:25,020
was in 2017 with all this information we

458
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:30,090
determined that these samples were most

459
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:32,190
possibly deploy in 2017 so in this way

460
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,260
we have our own judgment to the sample

461
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,540
distribution time friend and this graph

462
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,520
is very similar to the previous one but

463
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,210
as you can see there are actually some

464
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,980
simpler deploy in 2017 and the trend of

465
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,160
the sample number is still going

466
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:52,080
note that for 2019 we only collect the

467
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:54,000
samples before main this year so after

468
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,960
collecting all the sample what's the

469
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,600
next step because my goal is how I have

470
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,880
tried to have a clear pictures of the

471
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,679
campaigns in these fires I need to

472
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,750
figure out the relationship between each

473
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,650
sample so I start to do the

474
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,070
infrastructure

475
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,930
clustering to identify the campaign

476
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,030
because because attacker normally when

477
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,790
they do contact a campaign they were

478
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:21,420
used domains and IP address that can be

479
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,590
correlated and this is how we try to do

480
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,169
the clustering

481
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:29,009
to connect the dots I leveraged the

482
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:31,490
Pasadena's data the tool I use in this

483
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:34,289
part of the research is mainly my lingo

484
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,269
for those who are not familiar with this

485
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:38,820
tool matching go is an interactive data

486
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:42,299
mining tool that render directed graph

487
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:45,720
for link analysis because the

488
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:48,450
interacting interface is it's actually

489
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,820
looked like this so when I create when I

490
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:53,429
found the samples I found a CNC and then

491
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,990
I put the know into this graph and then

492
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:57,809
there are some transform that will

493
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:00,149
automatically find the passive DNS data

494
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:03,330
and then create a know and create a link

495
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:05,039
for me and this is how I do the costing

496
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,610
and find a connection between each

497
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,610
samples

498
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:13,559
it sounds pretty intuitive but actually

499
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,350
there are some difficulties of t-64

500
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,749
performing this analysis for example

501
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,269
once the challenge is incomplete

502
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:24,450
Pasadena's data well there are a lot of

503
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:28,889
Pasadena's there are they database but

504
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:32,100
none of them can be like completely like

505
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:34,830
100% guarantee that it's complete data

506
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,408
and another challenge is after the

507
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,559
report published in 2013 or attacker

508
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:41,700
might have changed the exposed

509
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:44,220
infrastructure entirely so no

510
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:47,190
connections can be found and the next

511
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,799
problem is the one that bring me most of

512
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,080
the headaches which are the single there

513
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,269
are a lot of sinkholes Rihanna fled in

514
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,830
any of the database so when I do the

515
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,480
pivoting when I try to do the

516
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,039
connections I will connect to a sinkhole

517
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,710
that actually connects to tonsure

518
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,269
complain and then I figure out oh this

519
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,149
is actually a sinkhole that I need to

520
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:09,990
pick filter out and also the parking IP

521
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:13,229
address when you create a domains from

522
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,539
maybe a hosting service provider they

523
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,610
were first before I actually assigned to

524
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:20,129
you they were first parking as IP

525
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:24,059
address so on the IP address you will

526
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:26,340
see a lot of Pasadena's records there

527
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:29,009
include Tunsil domain but they are

528
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,049
actually just parking there so this is

529
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:34,900
that kind of problem that I have when I

530
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:37,300
do the infrastructure clustering

531
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:41,170
and I got all the CNC infrastructure

532
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:44,230
from 200 samples I collected compiled I

533
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,960
collected samples compared between 2011

534
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:50,080
in 2018 and put them all in the graph

535
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,260
and pivoting the Pasadena's and this is

536
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,730
quite a time-consuming work but one

537
00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:00,690
eternity later I got this on the blue

538
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:03,430
circle shows the infrastructure that

539
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:06,880
consider as the cluster they are totally

540
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:09,460
in my cluster identify at after analysis

541
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,390
and in the middle you will see the

542
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:16,420
orange circle these are all the sinkhole

543
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:21,880
IP and the perking IP that's being

544
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:24,580
filter out and after after all analysis

545
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,220
were finally has a timeline of each

546
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,889
cluster and by examining the samples in

547
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,800
each cluster I try to further data my

548
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:36,220
the targets of each campaigns and it is

549
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:39,010
done by determining the decoy content

550
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:42,340
the summation locations in our internal

551
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:46,450
detection locations so from this

552
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:48,490
timeline you can see from 2014 2002 2019

553
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,770
there are nine campaigns involves ice

554
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,770
fog all these campaigns had not been

555
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:57,280
reviewing any public previous research

556
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:59,440
before the bus in gray color as a

557
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,110
smaller cluster they only have a few

558
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,020
samples officer you can see some sample

559
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,510
they were targeting Kazakhstan Russia

560
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:09,850
Turkish Tajikistan and America can never

561
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:12,820
pronounce this word well and there are

562
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:15,610
more targeted country in larger

563
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,290
campaigns due to the limited time I

564
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,699
won't be able to introduce all this

565
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,980
campaigns I will introduce some

566
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:24,880
interesting and large campaigns in the

567
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:27,100
following slides the first incident I am

568
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,370
introducing is a attack targeting

569
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:33,070
agriculture company in Europe this is

570
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:36,489
actually a sample found in the ir case

571
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:39,580
that we investigate in 2015 we found a

572
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,950
64 bits iphone p variants in the

573
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,929
compromised environment and the

574
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,260
investigations found that the earliest

575
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:48,400
intrusion was back in 2011 however the

576
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,000
attacker did not you

577
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,810
Icefall to get initials access according

578
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,660
to the log the attacker actually used

579
00:26:54,810 --> 00:27:00,370
Morocco so gold also called plaques and

580
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:04,000
the Nano malware called phone run to

581
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:06,820
continues your asses also we found a

582
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,310
malware co-vice right this is a backdoor

583
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,340
they only have been absurd used by a

584
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:15,010
group co-opt knife and although we

585
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,800
eventually you attribute this event this

586
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:20,200
incident to apt 9 we also found the

587
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,240
samples they are connected to apt tens

588
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,520
infrastructure so this is interesting

589
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,920
because because this TARDIS has been

590
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,700
targeted by multiple groups at the same

591
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,620
times and the Icefall backdoor found at

592
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,640
the scheme was a highly customized

593
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,570
version we think these samples was used

594
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,000
as a post

595
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,129
if exploitation tools because the

596
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,850
malware includes some code and leverage

597
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:47,860
as a second stage backdoor about

598
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,620
execution the mirror would check the

599
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:54,250
existence of a file and then it will

600
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,510
access if the file is not presented we

601
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,130
did not find this file in the

602
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:00,310
environment so we are not sure what it

603
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:02,740
is for when the foul is not presented it

604
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:05,919
would create a mutex with the key show

605
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,440
in the screenshot there and then it will

606
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,920
create a new threat to communicate with

607
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,500
znz server and this iPhone is also the

608
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:17,250
only variant that we observe unloading

609
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,980
an external files for the CNC

610
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:23,890
configuration so upon cuting you will

611
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:27,070
try to locate two files and then see if

612
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:30,840
this fell under the windows directory or

613
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:34,139
not and then if yes it was read encoded

614
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:38,350
configuration CNC domain from the file

615
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:40,390
in 2015 there is also another campaign

616
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,820
that I namely Tata news because the

617
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:45,760
campaign register a lot of CNC domain me

618
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,370
making as the news website below you can

619
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,710
see some samples in the CNC domains that

620
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:53,679
connects to some of the samples were

621
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:56,670
delivered by spear phishing email sent

622
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,710
to the targets in Mongolia and Russia

623
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,840
based on the email receiver and the lure

624
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,210
in the samples

625
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,809
targets are suspected in the government

626
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:09,090
finance and media sector the Icefall

627
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:12,509
variant using these campaigns are all

628
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:15,029
are all Icefall P parents and we found

629
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:17,899
that some samples include some suspected

630
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:20,249
campaign code inside the binary some

631
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:22,320
indicate probably the dates of the

632
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:25,860
attack and some other are probably just

633
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,379
a call for the campaign most of the

634
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,899
Icefall payloads are deployed drop by

635
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:33,360
the AR AR self-extracting our highways a

636
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:37,080
substitute the icon like the one shows

637
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,850
in the sly and the south extracting

638
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,119
files were dropped the mirror and the

639
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,998
decoy and the screenshot in the right

640
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:47,399
shows one of the decoy we found it is a

641
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:50,330
mongolian and according to google

642
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:55,199
translate it means special office or

643
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:58,529
jurisdiction one of the Icefall connects

644
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,700
to the cnc domain dell new subnet and

645
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:04,679
this domains has 13 supplements pivoting

646
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,299
these supplements we found some other

647
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,600
malware is connected to the same

648
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:12,809
infrastructure below are the is the

649
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,998
table that we found with the malware

650
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:17,668
family that connects to the subdomain of

651
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:20,190
this domain and you can see that these

652
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:22,950
domains include again so goo plug ax

653
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:25,649
melbourne the 10th on our also the

654
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:29,059
fun-run malware so apparently Icefall is

655
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:32,610
not the only tool used by this attacker

656
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:34,529
so pivoting the domain was passed dns we

657
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:38,519
found many other domains they are also

658
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:43,559
using the same new stands like micro

659
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:45,509
News Google News 4 News and this domains

660
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,789
were all registered with the same email

661
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:50,820
address from the stand register

662
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:52,799
this email address is actually a jackpot

663
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,960
because it is an email that we tracked

664
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,509
for a long time we belong to an

665
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,450
espionage campaign called roaming tiger

666
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:03,440
so roaming tiger was originally a

667
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:05,879
Spanish campaign discovered by a set in

668
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,220
2014 and the campaign targets

669
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:11,428
high-profile organizations in Russia and

670
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:14,759
former Soviet Union country including

671
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:18,509
Belarus Kazakhstan Tajikistan

672
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:23,029
Ukraine and Uzbekistan and the groups

673
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:25,889
mostly used so goo ba gas which is

674
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:29,399
frequency which is also another tour

675
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:32,039
shares by many Chinese or engines s

676
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:34,768
pondage group and before this research

677
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,509
we never know rumen tiger is also using

678
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:39,089
ice from our but now we know the

679
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:46,320
leverage ice fall two targets Mongolia

680
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:48,899
and Russia next campaign see in 2016

681
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,968
when I call the APRA campaign and this

682
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:53,218
campaign involved a lot of samples and

683
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:56,989
one of them was targeting Kurdistan and

684
00:31:53,219 --> 00:32:00,839
it was reported in the KC search bloc in

685
00:31:56,989 --> 00:32:04,559
September 2015 these samples is office

686
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:08,009
brushie with embedded malicious macro to

687
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,829
drop our ourselves extracting dropper it

688
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:13,979
will further trouble ISIL P variants and

689
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:16,918
in the screenshot at the right corner

690
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:20,159
you can see that's the decoy file inside

691
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:25,109
this macro malicious macro document

692
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:28,919
because macro is usually enable/disable

693
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:31,739
a by default for so the viewer is trying

694
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,679
to give a warning to the user and lower

695
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:38,969
than to open the Twingo able the macro

696
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:41,669
function in this table shows in the

697
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:43,829
right you can see the samples we found

698
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:46,379
in these campaigns and see why I'm in

699
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:48,299
this campaign upper because all the

700
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:51,418
sample we found in this campaign has

701
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:56,149
this PDB string with a username upper

702
00:32:51,419 --> 00:33:01,649
and you can also see the CNC domains

703
00:32:56,149 --> 00:33:04,529
that are pivoting to our IP address and

704
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:08,029
this IP address actually have another

705
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:11,249
domain which is Tajik stand trouble

706
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:15,649
dynamic dns and this is suspected

707
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:15,649
another domain used by their attacker

708
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:23,219
the next campaign was to place in 2018 I

709
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:25,279
call a water fight campaign because the

710
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:28,280
campaign target water source provider

711
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,500
but also banks and

712
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,290
based on the lure and language the

713
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:37,400
targets country including Turkey India

714
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:39,409
Kazakhstan Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the

715
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,679
samples officer in these campaigns are

716
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,750
dropped by the CB 2017 one one a to

717
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,679
exploit template that we mentioned

718
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:52,190
before in the slide previous shown and

719
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:57,320
this is sure amounts Chinese turning to

720
00:33:52,190 --> 00:34:00,410
attack groups and this is the screenshot

721
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,080
of the decoy file fowl in the samples of

722
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,250
this campaign does this looks familiar

723
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,370
to you

724
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:10,129
and this is actually the decoy file I

725
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:13,969
shows in the first lies in the tweets by

726
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:16,429
sniper by clear Skype and this decoy

727
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:20,029
showing the pictures of a Russian Winter

728
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:22,940
Olympic skater and the scripture on the

729
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:26,149
right is another decoy we found related

730
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:31,100
about the service level agreements with

731
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:33,560
India government the table is showing

732
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,899
the ice core samples drop by the exploit

733
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,210
document and these are all ice for P

734
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:40,310
variants and you can see that these

735
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:44,300
samples are all compiled in the short

736
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:49,609
periods around February 23rd and

737
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:51,980
February 24 and in February 23rd in the

738
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:54,379
short time is compiled a lot of samples

739
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:59,630
so the main campaign probably took place

740
00:34:54,379 --> 00:35:03,440
on that day and abandoned one of the cnc

741
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:06,710
domain is the this one I don't know how

742
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,660
to use this the whose water source time

743
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,660
any DNS the net

744
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:16,129
this is drop from samples that I shows

745
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:19,700
in previously this exploit document

746
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:23,500
which is has done in Ag 80 so actually

747
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:30,379
AG 80 is a water source accompanying us

748
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:32,690
in a second and then apparently these

749
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:38,420
campaigns is targeting the water source

750
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:40,220
company a lot and in 2018 there is

751
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,210
another large campaign that I caught a

752
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,118
pH

753
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:47,240
night campaign his first observations

754
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:50,060
was from the defections on our appliance

755
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:53,089
we detect the Icefall traffic come from

756
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:56,480
come out from the Philippine and the

757
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:59,450
traffic it shows in this box you can see

758
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,030
the CNC server and remember this special

759
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:05,990
traffic pattern that belong to ice fog

760
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:09,080
and searching the CNC domains on

761
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:12,259
virustotal we found two other URL with

762
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:16,759
also the ice fault traffic pattern which

763
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:18,740
is lock-on July and October 2018 so it

764
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:23,150
means that the attack was probably still

765
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:24,890
ongoing at that time and investigating

766
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,930
the CNC domain we found two other

767
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:30,379
subdomains and one of the subdomain is

768
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:34,819
committed by another backdoor Cohen CNT

769
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:38,000
samples which also caught Hugh hurries

770
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:42,260
me and sir who Spector and this backdoor

771
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,210
has been absurd used by apt 15 a Chinese

772
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,210
espionage group also called social

773
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:49,630
network team below is the samples

774
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:52,790
information this is interesting because

775
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:55,190
the an CMD is a mirror that we only

776
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:59,420
absurd use in the campaign attributed to

777
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:04,849
a PT 15 and a BD 15 has long history

778
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:08,690
targeting Philippine so what are the

779
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:11,180
domains found in the campaign in this in

780
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:14,089
campaign infrastructure cluster and

781
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,520
through the Pasadena's we found a lot of

782
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:19,790
domain that shows that their attackers

783
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,430
interest in Philippine you can see that

784
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:25,790
there are a lot of domains related to

785
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:29,029
Philippine and also pldt is actually a

786
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:31,820
telecom company in Philippine and also P

787
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:36,619
and OC is actually a oil energy company

788
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:38,630
in Philippine so from this connecting

789
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:41,270
four structure we found more malware

790
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:43,849
connected to them we discover more an

791
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:46,640
CMD samples they are connected to the

792
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:49,460
correlated infrastructure in addition we

793
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,450
found one miraj backdoor connect to the

794
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,940
domain suspect mimicking the

795
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:58,060
telecommunication companies

796
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:01,200
so Miraj back door is another back door

797
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,369
which associates you with APD 15

798
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,649
combining all these discovery

799
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:08,260
information all the discover information

800
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:11,140
the marijuana the techniques and the

801
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:14,859
TARDIS go we think these campaigns is

802
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:17,710
conducted by APD 15 this is another new

803
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:21,810
discovery because we did not know if a

804
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:25,030
PT 15 is also using the ice box samples

805
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:27,340
the last campaign is discovered this

806
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,490
year I call a skyline campaign

807
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,590
this campaign is likely target Turkey

808
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:35,589
and Kansas team based on the sample

809
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:38,920
submission country this campaigns also

810
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:41,170
leverage the expose to be 2017 1:1 a to

811
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,359
template and to drop the ice fault

812
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,970
malware from the time spent in this

813
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:50,290
exploit document the campaign is likely

814
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:52,740
start from 2018 the Icefall Varun's

815
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:56,380
officer in this campaign is the latest

816
00:38:52,740 --> 00:39:01,450
variants the ice for n-type and which is

817
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:03,880
the Fowler's pelo although the samples

818
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,189
in this campaign are using the same

819
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,380
exploit the weigh-in lunch the pelo is

820
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,450
different in previous campaign the

821
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,240
exploit document would drop an encoded

822
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:15,430
dropper they contend the pelo however in

823
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,979
this case the dropper only contains a

824
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:21,250
customized loader the Shaco in this

825
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:24,460
exploit document not only drops the

826
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:27,339
purple also it will write the encrypted

827
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:31,540
Icefall pelo into the registry key and

828
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:34,270
when the customer loader that drop

829
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:36,520
either dropper load it will try to read

830
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:41,380
the register key and then decree the

831
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:43,210
pelo and execute in memory the table in

832
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,280
this slide is showing the loader we up

833
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:48,730
stir in this campaign and the CNC

834
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,060
connected by the palos interestingly two

835
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:55,869
of the domains look like a pony car to

836
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:58,420
men but when I try to convert it one of

837
00:39:55,869 --> 00:40:00,599
it can be successfully convert but that

838
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:04,119
to Chinese word doesn't mean anything

839
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:06,340
another one doesn't cannot be convert at

840
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,730
all so I think is

841
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:12,280
is just the domain trying to forge as a

842
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:14,500
pune codomain i don't know why the

843
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,080
attacker do this not sure if this is a

844
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:21,130
way to bypass the detection or not but

845
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:24,790
this is kind of the new trick that using

846
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:26,530
the recent attack and the traffic

847
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,720
pattern is very similar with the iscope

848
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:32,590
ii variants however in one case we

849
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:36,209
observe the traffic at a group ID inside

850
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:39,520
the traffic pattern and this is a

851
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:43,660
suspected representative of the campaign

852
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:47,530
and also the Varens still preserved we

853
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:50,350
are logic to identify the assistant date

854
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:53,410
but it changed from the May 5th to

855
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:56,940
January 1st I don't see what's the point

856
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:59,980
of doing this but it should change and

857
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,990
so now we already know what happened

858
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,900
between these fires we found all these

859
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:06,729
campaigns that has their own different

860
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,370
infrastructure now let's solve the next

861
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:13,720
questions how do we attribute in this

862
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:15,549
campaign in our previous line we have

863
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,259
mentioned some campaigns that can be

864
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:20,740
linked to some no attacker groups

865
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,990
including the top news it can be linked

866
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,419
to the roaming tiger groups we had the

867
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:28,990
C&C infrastructure registry email also

868
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:31,360
the same targets go and TDP and the

869
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:34,540
attacker attacked them and the attack

870
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,490
targets the agriculture company in Euro

871
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,920
was attributed to a petite night

872
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:41,830
although this is considered as a

873
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,420
weakling because we only found the

874
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,040
samples in the environment but we are

875
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,560
not sure is used by the standard

876
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,080
Caribous but this is the only link we

877
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:53,279
found for this campaign and another one

878
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,799
is the apt 15 behind the campaign that

879
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:01,440
targets Philippine based on the mirror

880
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:04,330
and CNC overlap and the targets overlap

881
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,340
so now we have figure out some of the

882
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:08,860
attacker groups who are using ice for

883
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,660
secretly this rule has been tracked for

884
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,600
several years so we have the active

885
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,549
profile in your hands and as you can see

886
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,470
from the profile these groups have

887
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,589
different targets go

888
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:21,629
they have different tool sets

889
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:24,538
they have different interesting sectors

890
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,880
if you are organization belong to any of

891
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:29,219
the interstate sector in the charity

892
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,739
country then you should be aware of the

893
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:33,630
attacks from these from these groups and

894
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:36,119
understand the tools they are used by

895
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:39,210
this attacker group in their campaigns

896
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:43,349
and also of course icefrog is one of

897
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:45,059
them and what about the other campaign

898
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:46,920
they haven't been attribute are they

899
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:49,769
from the standard peckerwoods or are

900
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,380
they connecting with this with there's

901
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:56,368
no attacker group let's try to figure it

902
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:59,849
out so let's start to connect the dots

903
00:42:56,369 --> 00:43:02,219
by pivoting to infrastructure using each

904
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:04,979
campaign I found several connection

905
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:07,469
between them let's start from the latest

906
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:09,180
campaign skyline and this is the sample

907
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:11,460
and the connected infrastructure we

908
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,618
found in the skyline campaign this

909
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,109
domain is connected to an IP they

910
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:18,809
actually connect to the domain use in

911
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:21,089
the water fight campaign and one of the

912
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:26,849
domains is also observed in the campaign

913
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:30,089
targeting Tajikistan sorry string slower

914
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:33,630
and it also linked to the domains are

915
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:36,719
connected by a so go Mauer so remember

916
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:41,099
this ego of Tajik domains

917
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:43,950
let's see the next leg and so start from

918
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:47,190
this ego of 2g domains

919
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:49,979
it has a Pasadena's IP that actually

920
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:52,469
connects to the epic campaign and this

921
00:43:49,979 --> 00:43:55,049
IP address is connect directly by ice

922
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:58,289
fog a malware in the epic campaign and

923
00:43:55,049 --> 00:44:01,890
this IP also resolved by the domain use

924
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:06,119
in the same campaigns in the water fight

925
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:09,808
campaign and also if further link to

926
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:12,450
another so go malware and another tragic

927
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:16,380
domain which is the charging travel

928
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:19,879
tandem internet and from this

929
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:23,009
infrastructure it is further link to the

930
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:26,539
using water source dynamic tunnels which

931
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:29,700
is also in the water fight campaign and

932
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:32,369
from this infrastructure is can be

933
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,390
linked to a large campaigns that use the

934
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:36,740
so go and quick

935
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:39,629
he'll another backdoor used by Chinese

936
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:44,279
espionage group and this campaigns is

937
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:46,590
targeting Kazakhstan in 2015 I know all

938
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,500
these connections are like a math so

939
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,840
let's look at the next graph this graph

940
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,700
shows all the connections between this

941
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,890
campaign and we can see that all these

942
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,109
campaigns can be connected by the CNC

943
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,180
infrastructure now we know all these

944
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:04,140
campaigns are likely from the same

945
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:06,839
attacker groups the only connection

946
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:10,830
between these large cluster of the

947
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:13,130
campaign with existing attackers is one

948
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:16,770
of the samples that are shared between

949
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:19,410
roaming Tiger campaign with the campaign

950
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:23,970
targets Tajikistan is the same PDB

951
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:27,720
stream actually this class their targets

952
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:29,279
go of this Carter is very similar to the

953
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,919
targets of roaming tighter

954
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,960
however without further overlapping on

955
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:38,820
the infrastructure currently we still

956
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:42,150
track it separately so now here's the

957
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,490
new attacker groups profiles that we are

958
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:46,710
still tracking the link to the roaming

959
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,819
tiger so this room now does not have an

960
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,520
official name yet

961
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,880
however what we know is that this group

962
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:56,340
is Ely's active since 2014 and their

963
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,890
method of delivering malware is using

964
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:01,370
spear phishing email along with exploit

965
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:04,770
document malicious macro files and

966
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:08,069
self-extracting fell they targets Russia

967
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:11,280
Kazakhstan Tajikistan asbestos skin and

968
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:13,710
turkeys and they also use not only ice

969
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,140
fault but also so go and quit hell in

970
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:18,180
their campaign this one might have some

971
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,980
connection to Roman Tiger groves as I

972
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,700
mentioned but we need to find more

973
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:27,540
connection before we can merge them or

974
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:31,230
do further attribution so here come the

975
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:34,470
conclusions of this research Icefall is

976
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:39,140
a mirror sure amounts roaming tiger apt

977
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:41,490
15 the temper of a and the suspect apt 9

978
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,740
sure malware is a pitfall for

979
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:45,759
attribution we should not just do

980
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:49,299
attribution only based on the marrow

981
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:52,420
and the new actor profile that 10 group

982
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,960
a is aggressively using Icefall to

983
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:58,720
targets the above-mentioned region and

984
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,330
right with the latest Icefall and

985
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,368
variants the foul is version the whole

986
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:06,220
space detection for Palos are more

987
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:10,240
difficult so their new attacks are more

988
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:12,700
difficult to discover and because you

989
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,229
can see that all ice floor has eight

990
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,149
different kinds of variants and there

991
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:19,270
are two now there is totally 10

992
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:22,119
different variants which and attackers

993
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:24,580
are simply key continuously developing

994
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:26,590
the new variants which indicates that in

995
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:28,569
the future there will probably be more

996
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:31,000
attack leveraging Icefall in the

997
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:32,980
campaign and probably it will be sure by

998
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,580
more attacker groups so this is

999
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:41,950
definitely a mirror that their targets

1000
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:46,270
the targets should be aware of that's it

1001
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:49,299
and there are any questions Thank You

1002
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:52,619
Ashley so much so much congratulations

1003
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,619
for this presentation
