1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,139
whatever malicious apps you can think of

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,650
most likely they were present on Google

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:19,600
Play now I will continue with brief

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,849
analysis all these apps the

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,180
functionality what they did and how to

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:28,060
prevent getting infected let me start

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:37,870
with a fake apps which one would you

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:40,480
install one on the left side is official

9
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,780
Instagram on the right side is FEA as

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,870
you can see they have same icon

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:51,460
application name developer name and even

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:53,649
positive high rating when you don't want

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,079
to end up with such application you

14
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:58,510
should check writing as well as comments

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,809
of other users in this particular case

16
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,809
also number of installs because official

17
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:07,240
Instagram has 100 millions installs and

18
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:10,300
the fake one had on jihad only hundred

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,610
the purpose of the fake app was only to

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,690
display ads it wasn't actually harmful

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:19,289
to user but this changes which one would

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,289
you download now

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,530
this service is cryptocurrency wallet my

24
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:30,400
etherion wallet one of them is legit one

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,590
of them is fake as you can see they

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,300
share same icon application name

27
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:40,360
developer name positive rating I asked

28
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,780
on the Twitter what would people do what

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:48,600
would they choose and from over 500

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,600
votes 40% would go for malicious app

31
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,000
what's the worst thing is that this fake

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,400
app has better rating than than the

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,770
legitimate application so in this case

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,380
you cannot apply a rule check the rating

35
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,250
and check the comments because they

36
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,539
would be most likely fake in a case of

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,818
downloading applications that requires

38
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,280
your credentials or your sensitive

39
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:14,500
personal information I always advise

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,080
people to go to web page of the service

41
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,060
search for mobile application find the

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,930
link to Play Store and this is the app

43
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,879
you wanted

44
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:28,840
purpose of this fake app was to steal

45
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:32,750
your credentials now imagine a scenario

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,659
your smartphone is lagging there are

47
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,930
some pop-ups weird notifications some

48
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:40,819
ads you even find some application that

49
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,019
you haven't installed a lot of traffic

50
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:47,689
going in and out what you do for many

51
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,129
people this is the first time when they

52
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:51,858
go on a play store and download

53
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:54,700
antivirus security solution for their

54
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:59,419
smartphone right and they search for

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:02,988
highly rated for 4.6 and popular this

56
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:05,569
app had over half a million installs max

57
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,730
security once you install the ad open

58
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:11,418
the app and scan with an application or

59
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:15,048
smartphone this app actually tells you

60
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:18,319
that itself is it's highly this app is a

61
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:21,409
higher risk and advises you to remove it

62
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,679
from your device this is fake antivirus

63
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,750
on Play Store there were there were over

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,750
40 apps with altogether

65
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,970
millions of instance they shared the

66
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,909
same functionality they impersonate

67
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,250
legitimate purpose illegitimate have

68
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:39,769
legitimate functionality and they decide

69
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,949
whether AB is clean or bad

70
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:45,620
based on white listing and black listing

71
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:48,440
of activities package names and

72
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,680
permission it's not enough I did some

73
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,859
tests on my own try to bypass the

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,400
security solution and when the bad guy

75
00:03:54,859 --> 00:04:00,919
decides to pick package name which is a

76
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,949
unique ID for the application of let's

77
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:07,459
say something popular like Facebook

78
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:10,010
Twitter telegram something that's inside

79
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,709
wide lease application gets passed and

80
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,470
you are still infected what you should

81
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,259
do download only trustworthy security

82
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,949
solutions which are trustworthy well

83
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:24,229
google them up from fake apps move on to

84
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:27,710
popular category you probably know

85
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:29,450
through windows it's adware purpose of

86
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,450
adware is to display unwanted

87
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,289
advertisement to the user all these apps

88
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,169
were found

89
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:38,688
on Google Play Store by Trend Micro I

90
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:41,628
think it was even either this year or in

91
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:45,349
the end of last year and they had over

92
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:49,759
90 million installs ad where malware

93
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:50,599
family got upgraded and for last 3-4

94
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,789
years

95
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:54,849
we detect new malware family that is

96
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:59,050
actually based on adware

97
00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:02,119
it's called hidden app or hidden ad I

98
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,819
found these apps 16 apps on the Play

99
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:07,569
Store in November last year altogether

100
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:11,089
they have over half a million instance

101
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:14,149
they are a bit more dangers and without

102
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:16,939
any functionality once user launches the

103
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:19,099
app it downloads additional payload from

104
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:21,589
the developer server and makes user

105
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:24,800
install something that is necessary to

106
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:27,800
play the game Game Center once user

107
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,959
installs the app both of the apps from

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,979
Play Store and payload will hide from

109
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:36,050
users view and only deliver ads once

110
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:39,498
user unlocks his smartphone there's a

111
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,569
full-screen ad after some time there is

112
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:43,399
time delay there are ads after you run

113
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:49,069
different applications there are ads or

114
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:51,139
fake weird notifications the most

115
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:54,080
dangerous thing about them comparing

116
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:56,479
them to ad where is that developer

117
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,019
decides what kind of payload will be

118
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:04,818
downloaded this can be changed move on

119
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:06,709
to ad fraud new category for a couple of

120
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:10,099
years on Play Store the purpose of ad

121
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:13,610
fraud is to either hijack impressions of

122
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:17,289
ads or click on ads click on ads without

123
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:21,289
user knowing to generate ad revenue

124
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:24,619
maybe you know maybe new application is

125
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:26,628
file explorer manager one of the most

126
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:28,729
popular or one hundred million installs

127
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,399
it's not available on the Play Store

128
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:34,699
anymore because it contains ad for

129
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:37,189
functionality really similar to ad for

130
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,969
these clickers they are on the market

131
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:42,769
since 2014 the purpose is the same click

132
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,539
on ads in the background without user

133
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:47,150
knowing the first clickers

134
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:50,180
were clicking every 60 seconds on

135
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,190
as well first clicker were clicking on

136
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,040
porn ads to generate a lot a lot of

137
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,520
traffic so if the user is all day on

138
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,600
Wi-Fi he maybe doesn't care but once on

139
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,960
a mobile data it takes a lot of data I

140
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:10,150
did a test on that and within one hour

141
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:12,530
it could generate over 100 megabytes

142
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,169
these were latest clickers final

143
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,059
Playstore in the June or August last

144
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,790
year I have found they actually

145
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,830
contained a real functionality the first

146
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,690
one didn't and after some time they

147
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,419
would download additional payload that

148
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:29,050
is an insult or dynactin dynamically

149
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,460
loaded this payload is responsible for

150
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,190
clicking in there in the background to

151
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,989
generate ad revenue

152
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:39,040
these were clickers move on to fishing

153
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:43,730
but not fishing for banking credentials

154
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:46,280
mostly for social media one of the most

155
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,870
popular has a stealer or Instagram

156
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,630
stealer

157
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,360
I found couple of abs with thousands of

158
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,070
installs the purpose is to steal your

159
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,470
credentials and send them to the

160
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,540
attacker server however there's a

161
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,330
business model all these stolen

162
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:06,740
credentials are then used in as a

163
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:10,700
service to is used as a service for

164
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:15,500
other people to generate likes clicks

165
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:19,580
comments follows on Instagram another

166
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:23,740
application this app I was actually

167
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:26,080
paying to user to watch ads once user

168
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:30,380
earned a couple of dollars

169
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:34,240
he needs to log in to his PayPal account

170
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,650
through this application or HTTP

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,230
credentials were then sent to the

172
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:44,480
attacker server and of course fishing

173
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:47,840
for Facebook credentials from fishing

174
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,420
mode to cryptocurrency cryptocurrency

175
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,870
scams we actually know three different

176
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:57,290
types fake exchanges fake cryptocurrency

177
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:59,600
wallets and coin jacking or crypto

178
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,949
mining on infected device another

179
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,370
question is why

180
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:08,990
and when this happened in the end of

181
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:11,960
2017 and begin on beginning of 2018 when

182
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:16,070
the Bitcoin went to all-time high almost

183
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:18,560
twenty key exchanges wallets and

184
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:21,080
services were not prepared for that they

185
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,859
didn't have actual applications at that

186
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:28,040
time bad guys step in created fey gaps

187
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:32,060
upload into App Store and waiting and

188
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,189
they were waiting for credentials once

189
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,040
user launches them they have nice user

190
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,960
interface but credentials are stolen the

191
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,500
same applied to could the currency

192
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,830
wallets

193
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:47,330
including the popular services as my

194
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:49,780
aphelion wallet meta mask and others for

195
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,250
crypto wallets it was a bit different

196
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,350
because once you install a

197
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,870
cryptocurrency wallet there is generated

198
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,300
wallet for you in this case it was only

199
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,680
display the wallet of the developer of

200
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,170
the bad guy

201
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,780
so once user decides to deposit

202
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,630
cryptocurrency he doesn't own the

203
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:11,980
private key only bad guy can be draw

204
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:17,360
from the DES wallet and the last type of

205
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:19,340
cryptocurrency scams are our miners back

206
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,980
Smasher found a Play Store over a

207
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,470
million installs this app contained

208
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,760
shared library that I was mining monitor

209
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:31,040
on all the infected devices Android

210
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,050
Clipper a latest interest infiltration

211
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,449
that was found on Play Store Android

212
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,969
Clipper it's kind of new for Android

213
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:42,470
ecosystem the first clipper was found in

214
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:45,290
August last year by dr. web this one I

215
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,590
found is actually first clipper on Play

216
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:52,099
Store the purpose of clipper is to

217
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:55,220
exchange keep the currency address of

218
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,720
the recipient in a clipboard this app

219
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,510
impersonated Mathematica application and

220
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,460
here is how it looks

221
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:07,220
imagine scenario you want to send

222
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,200
cryptocurrency to some of your friends

223
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,600
or pay two services you copy the address

224
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,120
from the website and you paste it into

225
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:19,459
the recipient folder of your

226
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:23,629
wallet clipper will exchange the address

227
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:25,219
for the edges that belongs to bad guy if

228
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:27,499
you don't realize that if you don't

229
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,139
double-check the copied pasted address

230
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:34,569
you send your currency to to the bad guy

231
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:40,040
in this case this clipper could hijack

232
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:42,110
only Bitcoin and if theorem what even

233
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,129
spiral was presented on Playstore this

234
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,160
is the last one

235
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:49,999
found by Trend Micro it's called mopes

236
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:53,180
spy six apps on Play Store with over a

237
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:54,589
hundred thousands of installs purpose of

238
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,959
the spyware was to steal all the

239
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,069
personal information photos contacts

240
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,099
text messages

241
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:04,639
it could even a fish for Facebook

242
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,040
credentials this campaign is not spread

243
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,579
on Google plate anymore but outside of

244
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,230
Play Store using Facebook fan pages that

245
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:14,839
had thousands of thousands of likes

246
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,300
these guys are actually not really good

247
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,449
for security because when I analyze this

248
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,519
infiltration this mob spy I found couple

249
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:25,248
of open directory servers that contained

250
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,490
pictures of their victims phone records

251
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:31,550
and there's one more thing I have found

252
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:34,639
that actually anyone could access their

253
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:37,128
firebase console and could send global

254
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,819
messages to all the victims with custom

255
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:43,490
notification for example you are

256
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:47,599
infected please install this antivirus

257
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,519
solution was also government malware

258
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,550
this was discovered a couple months ago

259
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,509
by Security Without Borders which was

260
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:59,329
targeted or aimed only on Italy almost

261
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:02,360
20 apps or something over 20 apps for

262
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:04,370
two years approximately the purpose was

263
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,029
to steal all the personal information

264
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,759
and send them to the server now we are

265
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:13,610
heading to the last category of malware

266
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:17,149
on Play Store which could be one of the

267
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:20,569
most dangerous category that wants to

268
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:22,399
access your credentials and I want to

269
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:25,160
have access to your funds to their money

270
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,470
which is mobile banking Trojans we

271
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,949
divide mobile banking Trojans into to

272
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,670
carry

273
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:33,800
is simple fake ones in the complex one

274
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,040
let me quickly start with the simple

275
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,650
ones their goal is to impersonate only

276
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,819
one banking application once user

277
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:46,550
launches the app nice user interface

278
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,350
credentials are however stolen once user

279
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,780
logs in there is either some generic

280
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,450
errors such as back-end is not working

281
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,069
right now please try again later or they

282
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,460
open Play Store with official

283
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:00,710
application for the particular bank well

284
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,010
this is the new app please install that

285
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,900
we are out of date goal of simple

286
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:10,300
banking Trojans is to steal credentials

287
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,300
and bypass SMS two-factor authentication

288
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,290
comparing them to sophisticated or

289
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,790
complex banking Trojans they have wide

290
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,490
the range of capabilities

291
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,589
it could be remotely controlled steal

292
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,690
your contacts text messages browsing

293
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,930
history record for record phone calls

294
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,860
videos and many many others but their

295
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:33,290
goal is the same to get your credentials

296
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,930
but using different different methods

297
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:39,050
comparing two simple ones and also they

298
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:44,120
don't target only one application but

299
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:47,229
whatever apps you have installed on Play

300
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,760
Store there were a couple of different

301
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:53,720
Android banking sophisticated malware

302
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,330
families the most popular probably bank

303
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,110
boat and anibus and now I will continue

304
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,880
with analysis of enemies let me quickly

305
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,240
start with the Genesis or have it all

306
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:08,540
and when it all happened an abyss is a

307
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,570
based on open source code there was

308
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,520
leaked or open source in 2016 Bank

309
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,970
bought different versions different

310
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:20,060
varieties are also different branches

311
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:25,250
that were still based on the leaked bank

312
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:28,729
word for example comet bot is now being

313
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:33,020
sold in underground markets for 800 or

314
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:35,750
700 euros but it's not sophisticated at

315
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,270
all so that's the genesis of enemies now

316
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,520
let's continue with distribution on Play

317
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,810
Store least complex banking Trojans do

318
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,029
not impersonate banking

319
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,939
as it was with simple ones they

320
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:50,899
impersonate apps that are useful but

321
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:55,009
have some functionality since we are in

322
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:58,329
Poland notice also targeted attack on

323
00:15:55,009 --> 00:16:02,839
Play Store with enemies polish users

324
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:07,959
discarded by we told and this is the app

325
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:10,819
fly cabal ski it had over 1000 instance

326
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:14,479
now let me quickly go through overview

327
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:16,670
of functionality of enemies user

328
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,220
downloads the app what's happening in a

329
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,620
foreground he enjoys the functionality

330
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:25,160
of the app this is some currency

331
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:28,600
converter however in a background after

332
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,719
some steps I'll explain them on the way

333
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,389
malware starts to communicate with C&C

334
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:39,110
download second stage payload request a

335
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:41,410
victim to install that activate

336
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,689
accessibility Services and targets

337
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:47,420
banking applications this is rough

338
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:49,180
overview what's going on now let's dive

339
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,128
a little bit deeper

340
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:54,680
after malware is installed there are

341
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:57,800
some checks for emulation if it is

342
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,079
running in emulator or on device of the

343
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,059
actual victim there are some checks for

344
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,688
strings or libraries for package names

345
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:08,480
the default one however an abyss is

346
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:11,539
using one more and the emulation check

347
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,120
which is actually misusing movement

348
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:16,640
sensor because when the malware is

349
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:20,809
tested tested even either in emulation

350
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:24,409
your PC or using device that sits on

351
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:26,299
your table all the time but if it is in

352
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:31,490
a pocket of the victim is actually

353
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:36,500
moving if infected device makes seven or

354
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:39,049
more steps payload gets executed payload

355
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,419
starts communicate with the CNC by

356
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:45,440
sending information about device and

357
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:47,890
including the its name release and also

358
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,980
which applications are installed

359
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:54,440
potential targeted apps communication is

360
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,790
unencrypted and afterwards it requests

361
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,250
second-stage bail

362
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:01,190
before heading to second stage payload

363
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,530
let me quickly go through the

364
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,030
communication different versions have

365
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:09,230
different type of communication the

366
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:14,600
first one had the hard-coded CNC later

367
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:17,390
they start to use Twitter handles where

368
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,030
they send commands encrypted s tweets

369
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,790
saying was applied for telegram channels

370
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:25,940
and unifier Bay consoles firebase

371
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:29,240
console for some reason they used my

372
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,160
name in their CNC Lucas DeFranco as well

373
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,170
as their Twitter handles I don't know

374
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,450
why you guys probably don't really like

375
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:38,000
me

376
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:41,420
latest version of CNC is using or adding

377
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,010
one extra step the request server from a

378
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:48,800
telegram channel then needs to have

379
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:53,270
credentials and using the credentials

380
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:56,090
can download additional payload this is

381
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:58,580
Moore's most likely Donna to restrict

382
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:01,610
malware researchers to get their hands

383
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,189
on their latest payload so this was

384
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,290
communication C&C and infected device

385
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,750
then there is a request to download

386
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,909
second-stage payload some of them leave

387
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,090
their server open and there's not only

388
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:16,640
wanna payload but over 4000 of them

389
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:20,090
I have same functionality and they were

390
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,410
most likely built by some tool once the

391
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,050
payload is downloaded to to the

392
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,840
smartphone is requested to install using

393
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:31,790
social engineering so a user hits cancel

394
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,820
this activity will reappear eventually

395
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,889
user needs to install the application

396
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,870
afterwards after some time there is a

397
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:43,610
request to activate accessibility

398
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:45,020
services for Google service X ability

399
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,840
services are there for a reason in your

400
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,000
smartphone in your Android they are for

401
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,699
disabled users visually impaired users

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,020
to help them read the text soo min zoom

403
00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:00,410
out see which application is running

404
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:03,080
this is misused by enemies to perform

405
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:05,300
clicks on behalf of user to see which

406
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,908
application is running and also to

407
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,629
keylock all the user input

408
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:13,819
now welcome back user is requested after

409
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:16,968
some time to activate Google services

410
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:19,819
and he has no idea is it really from

411
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:23,599
Google from Android which add

412
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:24,499
responsible for this request once user

413
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,109
hits ok

414
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:30,409
malware takes control over infected

415
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:32,649
device and perform the clicks it

416
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:35,839
dynamically allows all the necessary

417
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:37,879
permissions for malware to to work send

418
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,418
text messages access context record

419
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:43,039
audio video and so on then malware waits

420
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:51,859
in the backgrounds for commands to be

421
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:53,749
executed the most interesting is key

422
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:56,869
logging functionality by misusing

423
00:20:53,749 --> 00:21:00,529
accessibility it can also disable play

424
00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:04,009
protect it has ransomware module and the

425
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:06,499
core is the fishing now I go quickly

426
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:09,559
through cryptolocker or ransom or

427
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:13,009
functionality when I tested that on my

428
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:16,940
smartphone malware received the command

429
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:20,569
and creeps the files on SD card with it

430
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:23,419
with its customer encryption creates dot

431
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:27,259
enemies dot script the anime script

432
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:31,069
extension and then a request user to pay

433
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:33,049
pay ransom it was range more

434
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:35,209
functionality move on to poor fishing

435
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:38,899
functionality how it works

436
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:41,079
an abyss checks for every application

437
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:44,359
that is launched by the user

438
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:47,178
24/7 let's say but if application wants

439
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:49,189
to run 24/7 and scan for processes for

440
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:51,649
applications there will be it will be

441
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:55,249
shut down by Android because it's waste

442
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:59,478
battery resources an abyss bypass is

443
00:21:55,249 --> 00:22:02,329
dead using the accessibility to confirm

444
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:04,669
or actually optimizes battery for itself

445
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:07,190
once this is done malware can run in a

446
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:09,769
background 24/7 scanning for a launched

447
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,399
applications if one of the targeted

448
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:16,009
banking app is launched by the user

449
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:20,238
malware will notify CNC server with a

450
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:21,920
package name of the application receives

451
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:26,510
the URL link to

452
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:29,710
activity this fishing this fishing HTML

453
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:32,150
is done displayed in internal webview

454
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,580
this internal web viewed and overlays

455
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:37,700
legitimate application and the request

456
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,560
user to login one in a background

457
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,000
launched by user one in the foreground

458
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:46,639
displayed by by enemies so that's the

459
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,340
font for functionality of anways now

460
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,000
let's move on to targets and which

461
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:55,699
targets over 350 mobile applications

462
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,700
where most of them are mobile banking

463
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,800
apps from these countries besides mobile

464
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,610
banking games its targets financial apps

465
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,860
papal shopping at Amazon the currency

466
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:10,719
exchanges cryptocurrency wallets email

467
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:13,820
client social media apps and many others

468
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,160
it also uses persistent technique to

469
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,590
stay on infected device as long as

470
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,500
possible by misusing accessibility

471
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,560
services one's user wants to manually

472
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,890
uninstall the infiltration detects the

473
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,080
package name this place the fake this is

474
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:33,230
a system application it cannot be shut

475
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:38,330
down removed kills the activity and goes

476
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:41,240
back to home screen also all Android

477
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:44,169
devices have by default it should have

478
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,030
by default enable Google Play protect

479
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:50,510
solution security solution let's not say

480
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:53,870
an abyss disables that after after it's

481
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:56,240
an infected device and if victim wants

482
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,669
to enable the head once again this is

483
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:03,950
the same fake notification it cannot be

484
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:05,660
done and shut down the activity for this

485
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,990
year I've been actually gathering

486
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:13,190
informations of enemies it was available

487
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:16,270
on Play Store and i found 17 handle

488
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:20,360
bases on Play Store with over 100,000

489
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:22,490
13,000 installs only in January these

490
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,330
numbers are not from Google not from

491
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:31,400
Android but articles blog posts tweets

492
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:34,550
from InfoSec community now you're maybe

493
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,660
asking well it looks really difficult

494
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,500
right to get

495
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,870
actually infected by enemies we have to

496
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,550
find application there's some another

497
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,979
application downloaded it has to be

498
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,659
installed some accessibility services

499
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,670
there are some clicks some pop-ups

500
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:55,130
there's a traffic recently I cut my

501
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:58,010
hands on a backup from one of the CNC

502
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:01,310
servers of an abyss there was there were

503
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:04,040
over 500 victims and I found out what an

504
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:06,649
abyss is also spread as SMS warmer

505
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,840
it sends itself with a you where a link

506
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:14,050
to all the all the context in your

507
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:18,320
contact list here is one of the locks

508
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:20,570
once victim is infected since 150 text

509
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,899
messages there are friends within one

510
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:27,110
minute receives three text messages

511
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,240
saying what is this and who you are so

512
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,449
apparently not everyone in your contact

513
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,800
list knows who you are within two

514
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:38,930
minutes receives four same text messages

515
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,690
the same text messages that were sent to

516
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:44,270
all the contacts within two minutes four

517
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,460
people downloaded the app installed got

518
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:52,639
infected and spread it further to their

519
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:55,370
contacts the text message says good app

520
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:00,350
please install and link to Google Play

521
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:04,040
Store this is the application the app

522
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:09,080
had 1000 installs and was available for

523
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:14,389
approximately 20 days on Play Store from

524
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:16,669
a 500 victims 82 sent this text messages

525
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,460
to their friends when when I grabbed all

526
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:22,730
the logs all the results that was sent

527
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:25,280
within 16 minutes over 9,000 text

528
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:28,360
messages to people you know your friends

529
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,820
family members colleagues and so on

530
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,110
besides that it was also successful when

531
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:39,110
gathering credentials for financial apps

532
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:42,649
including the security questions banking

533
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:44,990
apps and also Gmail account which is

534
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:47,620
really interesting because once the

535
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,809
attacker or enemies has access to your

536
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,229
two-factor or

537
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:56,279
indication device and your gmail account

538
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:58,740
which is for many us of us primer mail

539
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:03,169
account you can access other services

540
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:06,289
user is using and reset the passwords I

541
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:09,690
did some a stats on the server and

542
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:13,320
almost 60 victims actually sent their

543
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:15,330
Gmail accounts to Anna base fake screens

544
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,889
that overlay legitimate application

545
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:27,330
papal and some banking applications but

546
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:31,559
that's still not it there's one more

547
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:34,199
thing and Anna bees 2.5 got leaked in

548
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,600
March this year and it's available on a

549
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,499
couple of underground forums with source

550
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:43,789
code for free search ghost source codes

551
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:47,460
to back-end including the apk builder

552
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:49,769
what does it mean bad guys don't need to

553
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:55,320
know how to develop Android applications

554
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:57,629
they just simply build them so that's

555
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,279
about one of their recent hobbies

556
00:27:57,629 --> 00:27:59,908
banking Trojan that will spread the

557
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,369
blaze store

558
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:04,110
let me quickly wrap it up I was talking

559
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:05,570
about a different ways how you can get

560
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,740
infected

561
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,418
outside of Play Store searching for

562
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,210
cracked apps social engineering

563
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:15,659
receiving text messages with a link to

564
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:19,289
malware as you saw in Android Android

565
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:21,749
enemies case and from Play Store there

566
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:26,580
were a couple of bad malicious apps on

567
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:30,049
Play Store I was talking about using the

568
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:34,350
tactics and how you can stay safe a

569
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:37,499
couple of quick tips download apps still

570
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:41,090
download apps only from Play Store no

571
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:44,100
joking but before that check the rating

572
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,259
developer named check the comments or

573
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,019
the safest way as I mentioned when

574
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:52,440
downloading apps that actually request

575
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:56,309
your credentials your personal

576
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,500
information is to get to web page of the

577
00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:01,080
service search for mobile application

578
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,700
you get the link link redirects you to

579
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,720
play store and this

580
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,090
the app you want to download and also

581
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,750
the not activate accessibility services

582
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:15,929
to apps you have no idea about the

583
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,730
inclusion number of Android malware is

584
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,490
rising there is more and more Android

585
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:23,250
devices more and more Android apps app

586
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:26,570
developers and this is a great ecosystem

587
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:28,920
for bad guys to create their malware

588
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:31,110
most of the time they got inspired from

589
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,570
windows ecosystem sophisticated

590
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:37,709
ransomware crypto and summer banking

591
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:40,169
Trojans Clippers and others they

592
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,930
bypassed security of Play Store so

593
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:46,470
actually available to anyone and there's

594
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:49,350
one more thing one more take away that

595
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:52,770
even a lag of security your friends

596
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:58,429
colleagues family members can make sure

597
00:29:52,770 --> 00:30:04,079
one herbal thank you very much

598
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:04,079
[Applause]
