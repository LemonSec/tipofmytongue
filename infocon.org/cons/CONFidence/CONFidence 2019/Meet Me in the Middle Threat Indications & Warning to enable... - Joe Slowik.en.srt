1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,820
good morning the pleasure to be in

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,079
Cracow pleasure

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,040
first confidence something I might have

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,440
for this talk

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,860
anyway we almost have to like go down so

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,310
yes my name is Joseph slow ik I am NOT a

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,500
hacker

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,279
I am a dedicated defender I'm a blue

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:30,430
Timur I got my start in US government I

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,470
was a naval officer doing a various

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,079
cyber sorts of missions and then I was

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,730
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,860
running the incident response team for a

14
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,718
while but as part of that work one of

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,790
the things that always drove my passion

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,070
was the idea of threat intelligence and

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,930
while that's something that I do and

18
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,460
while I'm still a dedicated defender now

19
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,380
I'm doing this more or less on my own

20
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,050
terms in the private sector in the US

21
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,870
for a industrial control system focused

22
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,069
security company called Drago's so I've

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,040
been there for a little over two years

24
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,900
now focusing on the ICS landscape but

25
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,760
still taking that very threat

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,700
intelligence focused approach to what it

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,170
is that I do now you might think about

28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,909
this like well threat intelligence where

29
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,250
is this coming from for you and well my

30
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:14,320
background is a naval officer certainly

31
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,479
has the cyber aspect but the community

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,389
that I was in included intelligence

33
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,060
operations so usually when people hear

34
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:24,280
that I have a passion for cyber threat

35
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,389
intelligence they assumed that I was an

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,280
intelligence officer however I was not

37
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:32,619
my opinion of intelligence officer is is

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,539
varying depending upon the intelligence

39
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:36,729
person because you have various

40
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:38,799
stereotypical ways of looking at what

41
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,569
these sorts of people do from you know

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,189
what the public thinks that we do to

43
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:44,020
what some people might want to think

44
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:46,270
that they do to what they really do

45
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,959
which is making lots of powerpoints but

46
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,420
irrespective of that my field while I

47
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,399
did lots of cyber sorts of things was

48
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,700
really dedicated towards technical

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,229
intelligence so signals intelligence

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,599
analyzing radar and then cyber was just

51
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:04,270
one part of the things that I did and a

52
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,939
lot of the motivating goal behind that

53
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,098
job was to provide the people in the

54
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,440
ship or in the aircraft or whatever with

55
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:12,880
near real-time data about threats that

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,670
they were facing which is something that

57
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,459
I've brought with me into the more

58
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,440
traditional network defense field now

59
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,660
and something that I think has a

60
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,840
significance for how we conduct cyber

61
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,069
threat intelligence from a pure blue

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,290
team perspective in the current

63
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,179
environment so what are we going to talk

64
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,010
first we're gonna talk about what's the

65
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,689
purpose of intelligence because if we

66
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,250
don't get clear on what it is that we're

67
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:38,500
doing I don't think it makes sense to

68
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,540
talk about this so lay the groundwork

69
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,709
for some common definitions then we'll

70
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,629
talk about what threat intelligence

71
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,120
means from an operational standpoint

72
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,328
before moving on to this concept of

73
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,590
indications and warnings that real-time

74
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:52,060
threat intelligence aspect and then

75
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,549
provide some examples and applications

76
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,140
to illustrate what we've talked about

77
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,349
and provides some ways of taking this

78
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,540
back to your organization so first what

79
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:03,760
is intelligence so back when I was a

80
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,679
student I'm older than I look

81
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,629
the gentleman by the name of Donald

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,510
Rumsfeld was secretary of defense for

83
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:12,280
the United States and he had this quote

84
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,659
that many people made fun of because it

85
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,730
sounds pompous ponderous etc that there

86
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,590
are three kinds of knowledge are the

87
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,790
things that you know which okay we know

88
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,129
the things we know that's fine

89
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,019
there are the things that we don't know

90
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:28,420
about but we know that we don't know

91
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,530
them there are known unknowns and then

92
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,569
those are the things that we don't even

93
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,799
know that we don't know so that sounds

94
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,899
kind of silly but when you think about

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,060
it a little bit it applies to what we do

96
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,190
from a network defense standpoint so we

97
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,859
know what we know I know the hashes for

98
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,840
the latest version of sofa C or wente or

99
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:45,190
emote ed or something I know what I

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,230
don't know I don't know the latest

101
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,209
variant maybe but I have a reasonable

102
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,010
understanding for how this malware works

103
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,480
or what its command and control looks

104
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,040
like but then there's the things that I

105
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,048
don't even know I don't know what the

106
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,388
adversary might do next what they might

107
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:00,730
change to for operational purposes and

108
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:02,889
that I really know just not don't even

109
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,540
need to just find out but I need to

110
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,760
figure out how to figure out I don't

111
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,819
even know that in the first place so it

112
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,828
seemed circular in a fashion but it's an

113
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:14,440
important way of understanding what the

114
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:15,790
goal is of what we're trying to do and

115
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,779
furthermore when we start talking about

116
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,510
intelligence it's not a

117
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,820
one-size-fits-all application instead

118
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,849
intelligence really depends on who your

119
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,349
audience is so this is a image

120
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:28,389
illustrating from a military perspective

121
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,639
as sort of the concepts in question that

122
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,949
really things run the gamut from big

123
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,620
picture strategic perspective all the

124
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,479
way to the tactical day-to-day operation

125
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,360
standpoint and what's important to

126
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,940
realize with this image is that your

127
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,440
product your message the information

128
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,090
that's most

129
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,280
relevant varies depending on your

130
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,049
audience and if you're not modifying

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,940
what it is that you're saying and how

132
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,590
you're presenting it to who it is that

133
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,270
you're presenting you're probably going

134
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,090
to result in a message that's not going

135
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,000
to be received very well or even

136
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,979
understood all particularly well and

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,870
when we talk about intelligence - there

138
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,840
are three primary things that it

139
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,270
requires to be useful so first off has

140
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,710
to be accurate um if your intelligence

141
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,840
is not accurate then what what are you

142
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,789
even doing you know just roll things up

143
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,859
we don't care anymore but it also has to

144
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,240
be timely it's one thing to say and this

145
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,890
gets into the concept that we'll be

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,960
talking about in greater detail today

147
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,070
you know I can provide you with great

148
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,099
information about something that

149
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,750
happened ten years ago what does that do

150
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,520
for you now it informs you on something

151
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,350
that happened previously but it doesn't

152
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,750
necessarily help you with what's going

153
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,780
on right now and lastly it must be

154
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,690
relevant so if you are defending a bank

155
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,099
or if you are defending a software

156
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,290
development company that has a lot of

157
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,120
intellectual property and I give you

158
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,910
lots of information about hacking

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,520
elections that's interesting is it

160
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,070
really relevant though maybe some of the

161
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,680
TTP's behind it might be for how things

162
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,690
initially started off but you know how

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,060
groups hacked Facebook or whatever

164
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,130
created lots of social media profiles it

165
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,380
doesn't matter so it's not relevant so

166
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,200
ensuring that we have these concepts in

167
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,950
mind makes the product we produce from

168
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,990
an intelligence standpoint useful but

169
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,150
that use like I implied earlier is going

170
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,220
to depend on who your audience is so at

171
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,120
the very highest level talking to your

172
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:23,070
c-suite your CIO your C ISO the board of

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,510
directors or your boss perhaps or

174
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,610
whatever you have this big picture

175
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,219
strategic level like what's going on you

176
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,190
know or what what is it that the Chinese

177
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,800
maybe are trying to steal in terms of

178
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,169
intellectual property based upon current

179
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,450
planning by their government okay

180
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,280
you know that's useful potentially from

181
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:44,610
a big-picture planning perspective but

182
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,710
your sock doesn't care about that at a

183
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,200
mid level like okay well what are the

184
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,810
sorts of things going on on a day to day

185
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,849
on a not necessarily day to day basis

186
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,500
but over time that I need to invest in

187
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,969
in order to make sure that I'm meeting

188
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,889
what's going on in the

189
00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:00,748
Fireman so your sock managers your

190
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:02,549
incident response managers the people

191
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:04,889
who are setting budgets deciding what

192
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:07,019
tools to acquire what sort of landscape

193
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,249
do I face that's going to inform the

194
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,889
decisions I make that are going to

195
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:13,739
impact operations for the next three six

196
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:16,289
nine twelve months and finally at your

197
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:18,388
tactical level what's going on right now

198
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:20,579
what phishing campaign is going on right

199
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,649
at this moment or do I anticipate in the

200
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,110
next week how does it behave and what do

201
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,789
I need to do to detect it respond to it

202
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,860
and then remediate it so a very

203
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:30,628
immediate sort of level detection and

204
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,919
analysis and that's really what we're

205
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,389
gonna focus on mostly for this

206
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,219
conversation that doesn't mean that

207
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,379
these don't matter it just means that

208
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:39,209
your strategic and operational audiences

209
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,249
are much smaller generally speaking even

210
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,279
though they're very important and really

211
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:46,409
this talk is meant to inform the

212
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,269
immediate defender to make him or her do

213
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,669
their operations better to respond to

214
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:53,309
threats now when we start talking about

215
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:55,198
the intelligence as a process you know

216
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:57,360
really we look at this as a sequence of

217
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,249
events that we begin with an operational

218
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,249
environment move on to the collection of

219
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:04,079
data distill that into information and

220
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:06,419
then from that produce some sort of

221
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,979
deliverable but oftentimes when we look

222
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,799
at what's provided from commercial

223
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:12,959
threat intelligence that the things that

224
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,839
we emphasize are the data aspect and

225
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,209
then the intelligence aspect what's

226
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,159
missing well we've talked about you know

227
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:23,039
your phase 1 you know gather a bunch of

228
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:25,319
data something mysterious happens and

229
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,759
then phase 3 I have a threat

230
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,639
intelligence report either a private

231
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,279
report that you paid many you know much

232
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,779
money for or a public report that's part

233
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,029
marketing part threat intelligence or

234
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,159
whatever but what happens in the middle

235
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,938
is kind of missing and so you're left

236
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,620
with this sort of bifurcation this

237
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,629
division between what happens very

238
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,879
immediately data and then what happens

239
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:49,980
after quite a period of time generating

240
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,339
intelligence and ignoring what's in the

241
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,959
middle

242
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,689
hence the talk meet me in the middle

243
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,069
anyway so if we look at this

244
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:57,389
you know threat intelligence reports

245
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,949
many of us are familiar with these sorts

246
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:01,740
of ideas they're finished reports or

247
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:04,199
it's a narrative that describes an event

248
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,399
campaign a piece of malware maybe that's

249
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,929
a separate topic whether or not that's

250
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,660
actually intelligence we can talk about

251
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:13,120
that at the bar maybe later but you know

252
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,550
lots of detailed information in here

253
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
that requires a lot of time effort and

254
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,349
analysis to get from that data

255
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,449
perspective to a finished intelligence

256
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,190
report thus it's not going to be

257
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,320
something that you get immediately after

258
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,420
or while something is occurring but

259
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,940
often weeks usually months potentially

260
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,189
even years after something happens so

261
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,440
it's after event has taken place your

262
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,580
backward-looking you're always sort of

263
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,470
backward looking because these are

264
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,210
always responses to things that had

265
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,130
happened but in the case of a finished

266
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,660
intelligence report you're significantly

267
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,939
backward looking because you can only

268
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,520
produce this after a period of

269
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,920
significant analysis and production so

270
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,500
examples of this range from the sort of

271
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,420
foundational aspects of our field you

272
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,880
know the mandiant apt one report the

273
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,189
initial big bang of commercial threat

274
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,900
intelligence reporting to really good

275
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,900
malware analysis reporting like

276
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,490
semantics Stuxnet dossier things that

277
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,959
are controversial like Kaspersky

278
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,550
slingshot report especially if you were

279
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,200
in the u.s. it was a good report though

280
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,630
two things that are just really bad

281
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,580
the Norse growing cyber threat from Iran

282
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,260
report that is the report to look at if

283
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,790
you want an example of what not to do in

284
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,050
a threat intelligence report and they're

285
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,810
out of business so I don't don't worry

286
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,329
about them yelling at me but anyway so

287
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,010
that's good you know we have examples of

288
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,810
that but what about something that

289
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,910
defenders deal with on a daily basis

290
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,800
indicators have compromised you always

291
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,390
hear people like you know I need the IOC

292
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,390
s I need the iOS either do something or

293
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:41,110
whatever you will see you know IOC s

294
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:43,560
ideally or contextual but usually IOC s

295
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,850
as we receive them to act upon our

296
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,859
atomic in nature it's a single data

297
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,010
point an IP address a hash value a

298
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,950
domain they're nice and then it's a

299
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:56,020
speedy quick way to transit transfer

300
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,810
information to communicate it to other

301
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:02,829
parties but they're lacking in the sense

302
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:04,180
that it's for the one on the ones stance

303
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,830
they could be highly variable in terms

304
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,510
of the quality you know are you getting

305
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:10,000
good IOC s or you're getting bad Auto

306
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,850
C's am I getting the hash value for PS

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,680
exec or for you know the hash value for

308
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,300
Muni cats what does that really tell you

309
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,859
because it's trivially easy to change

310
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,229
the hash value of mimi cats the source

311
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,030
code is on github I can do whatever the

312
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,220
hell I want with it thus the hash is

313
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,839
meaningless so it's a lot of

314
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,040
questions for what actual value I'm

315
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,570
getting out of them even if I can

316
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,630
transmit them and receive them quite

317
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:34,390
quickly so for example the indicator of

318
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:37,570
compromises that initially developed was

319
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,760
a not a single data point but multiple

320
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,460
data points clustered together so when I

321
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,830
see this set of hash values court along

322
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,600
with this registry key or whatever I

323
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,460
know that I have an indicator of this

324
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,130
specific type of compromise there's a

325
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,200
lot to be said for that idea it's not

326
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:57,160
perfect but it gives you some idea of

327
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,170
you know if a and B or C then alert

328
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,360
there's some contextuality built around

329
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,040
that the problem is is that when we talk

330
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,560
about indicators of compromise what we

331
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,319
get are these this is the grisly step

332
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,900
report that the us-cert released in

333
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,300
response to Russian meddling in US

334
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,310
elections and it had a lot of iOS ease

335
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,439
like if you're just strictly judging by

336
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,209
quantity this is a good report but if

337
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,160
you're judging by quality it leaves a

338
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,930
lot to be desired because yes I have

339
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,930
values and even though they had the

340
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,520
presence of mind to say comment explain

341
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,500
what this was none of these are actually

342
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,550
filled in so I don't know what any of

343
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,380
these are for is that a

344
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,140
command-and-control address was it a

345
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,300
domain used to deliver a file is it a

346
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,010
domain that was a compromise legitimate

347
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,560
address therefore maybe I shouldn't

348
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:44,020
block it but I should alert on it so

349
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,630
this seems like it's good but I refer to

350
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,840
this kind of as information security

351
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,580
junk food you can devour lots of it very

352
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,990
quickly and easily but it doesn't

353
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,000
nourish you at all it doesn't really do

354
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,330
much for you and then as we start

355
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,450
getting to these atomic not very

356
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,190
contextual examples of an indicator then

357
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,440
we want to start talking about ingesting

358
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,120
them and using them at machine speed so

359
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,650
this is just one example there's plenty

360
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,160
of commercial examples of this as well

361
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:15,220
of a us centered initiative on trying to

362
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,510
get organizations to share I OCS rapidly

363
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,940
so that they could put them into their

364
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,340
defenses right away well that sounds

365
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,910
good except if you want to do something

366
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,860
like block Google or block Microsoft or

367
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,569
you know blacklist PS exec which your

368
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,220
admins might be using or something along

369
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,300
those lines this is how you do it

370
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,460
because you're just ingesting

371
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,680
information without analyzing it which

372
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,410
can lead to very bad things like your

373
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,149
users can no longer get to Gmail or

374
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,279
users can no longer resolve DNS

375
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:45,660
depending upon what how your environment

376
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:49,620
is laid out so can be very bad so from a

377
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,629
coverage perspective iOS sees us to get

378
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,949
quick alerting and response you know

379
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:55,230
it's beneficial in the sense that I can

380
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:59,790
do something fast but I lose the ability

381
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:02,370
to add context or any sort of additional

382
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:05,339
information around it while intelligence

383
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,279
reports can be very thorough the win32

384
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,259
Stuxnet report is hundreds of paetynn

385
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,490
120 ish pages long it's very interesting

386
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,870
and very detailed and very in-depth but

387
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,459
as a result of that though it takes

388
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,319
months to put that sort of analysis

389
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:21,029
together if not longer so if I'm talking

390
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:23,519
about an incident that's happening right

391
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:25,470
now in real time it doesn't do a whole

392
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,829
lot for me in order to help respond to

393
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,009
that

394
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:31,170
so what we're missing is here so we've

395
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:32,970
talked about raw data those IOC's we've

396
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,219
talked about the very fancy intelligence

397
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:38,490
reports but what about just minimally

398
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,069
enriched data things that we've taken

399
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,990
the raw feed from and added just some

400
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:44,969
minimal bit of context around so that

401
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,220
while we're getting something fairly

402
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,139
quickly we've also managed to add a

403
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,149
little bit of extra information around

404
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,670
it so that we understand one one it

405
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:56,880
might be - we verified that it's

406
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,709
actually bad and three made sure that it

407
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,310
might be relevant to the audience that

408
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:04,589
we're talking about so in supporting

409
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,099
operations intelligence doesn't exist in

410
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:07,889
a vacuum

411
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,540
if intelligence existed on its own then

412
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:11,310
I don't know although if you look at the

413
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,160
news recorded future was just acquired

414
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,329
for like 750 million u.s. dollars so

415
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,149
evidently we're doing something right

416
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:19,680
but for an intelligence to be functional

417
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,319
or useful or valuable it has to support

418
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,000
actual defence operations but in order

419
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:26,459
to do that we're all indicators as we

420
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,899
see with iOS see reports aren't good

421
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,689
enough because it's gonna make us make

422
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,040
mistakes it's gonna let us feel like

423
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:34,769
we're doing something even though we're

424
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,649
not doing much at all and the finalized

425
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:40,379
reports are good but they're not timely

426
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:42,509
so what we really need to do is enriched

427
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,579
information that provides indications of

428
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:46,380
hostile activity and warning of

429
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:48,329
malicious behavior that can be

430
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,709
informative and time-sensitive so

431
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,239
getting back to that concept of

432
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,459
intelligence needs to be

433
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,080
relevant accurate but also timely in

434
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:57,719
order for it to be operationally

435
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,310
relevant so my background on this I

436
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,380
hinted at this the very beginning of the

437
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,180
presentation so I was what was then

438
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,399
called an information warfare officer

439
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,349
there now called Cryptologic officers

440
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,209
because as a community but the community

441
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,760
I was in is very confused about what to

442
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:13,829
call ourselves but the idea though is

443
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,450
that you get sailors sitting at consoles

444
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,370
and darkened rooms on a ship or whatever

445
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,610
that are just trying to figure out like

446
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,620
okay I can see for example that I have a

447
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,180
radar track or I have something that's

448
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,339
picked up on a sensor somewhere and

449
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,510
based upon that data point I can

450
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,520
correlate it with another data point

451
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,740
what frequency that radiates radar is

452
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,180
operating on or some aspect of the

453
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,430
communication that's been intercepted

454
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,649
from that particularly unit and

455
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,599
correlate that with a set of information

456
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,790
to figure out what it is so I can

457
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,160
differentiate not just that we have a

458
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:47,490
contact somewhere out there in the world

459
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,250
but I have a contact whose radar happens

460
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,709
to map on to this type of aircraft which

461
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,260
given the order of battle for where

462
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:57,000
we're operating correlates to this

463
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,930
platform for this country that doesn't

464
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,540
like us very much

465
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,770
therefore you should care about this I

466
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,899
haven't figured out what its intentions

467
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,030
might be I haven't figured out what the

468
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,890
broader strategic scope might be that's

469
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,959
for the intelligence analysts to do

470
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,640
months later but I've informed the

471
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,110
people that I'm directly supporting that

472
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,939
hey there's something that you should

473
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:17,010
probably care about that's out there

474
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,750
here it is and based upon what

475
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,920
correlating information here's what you

476
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,689
might want to do about it

477
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,610
so you don't have the complete picture

478
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:25,050
but it's a lot more than just saying

479
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,280
there's a dot out in the middle of the

480
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,710
ocean somewhere and we don't know what

481
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,170
it is it gives people who are operating

482
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:34,559
tactically enough information to start

483
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,480
making informed decisions about for self

484
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,760
defense well this is a concept that

485
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,679
sounds pretty useful from a network

486
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,720
defense concept as well so to reference

487
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,540
another American with Polish heritage

488
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,950
Richard Beit lick and closure I worked

489
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,870
with his wife Amy who is also a very

490
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,030
brilliant intelligence analyst he

491
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,949
defined sort of a concept of indications

492
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,780
and warning from a network security

493
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,850
monitoring standpoint in his book the

494
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,530
Tao of network security and what's

495
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,020
important to emphasize about this if you

496
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,158
could read quickly but the main thing is

497
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,749
really a

498
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,590
understanding that the indications and

499
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:13,859
warning part is dialed in to are focused

500
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,619
on hostile behavior what its indications

501
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:18,710
are in warning of what may be to come so

502
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:21,289
this very threat focused very much

503
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,399
attack focused as opposed to either

504
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:25,859
informative educational like you might

505
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:28,049
see in an intelligence reporting or very

506
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,178
atomic and unenriched like you see with

507
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:32,158
an IOC we're trying to add on not just

508
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,049
that something is happening but context

509
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,789
around it so that we know from a

510
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,619
defensive standpoint what we could do

511
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,950
about it

512
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:42,959
so what inw avoids attribution

513
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,669
attribution is a touchy subject because

514
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,320
you know you never want to say like oh

515
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:47,609
the Russians or the Americans did this

516
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,049
or whatever because then we'll prove it

517
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:50,879
how do you know this or whatever like

518
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:52,649
that's an entirely separate line of

519
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,449
conversation takes a lot of work a lot

520
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:56,580
of analysis which means it takes a lot

521
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,320
of time so we want to avoid that in this

522
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,299
case but also we want to avoid adversary

523
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,099
intent so from an indications and

524
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:04,259
warning perspective I don't care

525
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,849
necessarily beyond the strict

526
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,549
functionality of a piece of malware what

527
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:09,989
it's for I don't need to care if the

528
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,389
French are trying to steal nuclear

529
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:14,159
secrets are trying to gather political

530
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:15,599
military intelligence or whatever from a

531
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,519
strategic perspective I just need to

532
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,989
know that I see Animal Farm in my

533
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,580
network and here's what the

534
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:22,309
characteristics of this bit of malware

535
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,178
those are all topics for

536
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:25,950
backward-looking let's you know

537
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,749
understand what the incident involved

538
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,789
and I can write a report on it later but

539
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,739
for in the moment defense that doesn't

540
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:33,899
matter it doesn't help your sock to

541
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:35,970
respond to what's happening well instead

542
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:37,830
we need to focus on is differentiating

543
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,599
categorize threats does this malware

544
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:43,649
spread is a command can

545
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,029
initial access tool is it a some other

546
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,978
sort of tooling or whatever and how do I

547
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:49,440
respond to it one of the characteristics

548
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:51,809
of this network traffic is this IP

549
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,549
address or domain adversary controlled

550
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,559
or is it adversary compromised and what

551
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:57,269
does that mean for me and those informed

552
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,399
offenders who enable their response do I

553
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,779
block it do I let this go so I can

554
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,090
capture some traffic to see what's going

555
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:05,909
on before I respond how do I remediate

556
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,129
this malware do I need to just delete

557
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:09,629
the file wipe the machine or do I need

558
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:10,949
to take the motherboard out throw it in

559
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:12,869
a wood chipper and never use that device

560
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,629
again because I've had some bios-based

561
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:17,728
you know in firmware a rootkit or some

562
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:19,740
other exotic thing in mind how do I deal

563
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:22,360
with the threat in question

564
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,430
but in saying this it's important that I

565
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,750
get some grief from traditional

566
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,340
intelligence analysts it's like you're

567
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,380
saying my job doesn't matter like no

568
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,780
your job does matter and in fact these

569
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,580
positions these roles work together

570
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,460
fundamentally if you look at this as a

571
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:38,199
cyclical process is that cyber threat

572
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,530
intelligence tracks the overall threat

573
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,170
landscape what apt 28s malware looks

574
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,270
like what equation groups malware and C

575
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:49,210
2 functionality looks like and then

576
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:51,790
informs inw by providing the data that

577
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:54,130
indications and warning uses to enrich

578
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,409
individual observables so that from a

579
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,680
day-to-day operation standpoint you're

580
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:01,840
in the field tactical intelligence

581
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,190
operation is taking what's observed and

582
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,290
matching that against what is known

583
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:09,010
about the environment to produce an

584
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:10,510
enriched set of indications and warnings

585
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,550
about observed behavior in the

586
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,230
environment but what's important is that

587
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,760
that just doesn't sit in isolation and

588
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,340
not just isolation in the sense that I

589
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,890
inform the Sox that they can respond I

590
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,770
also need to inform my bigger picture

591
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,870
CTI analysts that hey this is what we've

592
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,000
observed so they can begin to modify

593
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,250
their picture their bigger picture of

594
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,130
the overall adversary environment which

595
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,010
lyn feeds back into the context and

596
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,230
background that I use on a day to day

597
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,910
operational level to categorize inform

598
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,430
and enrich the things that I observe in

599
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,200
my environment so really while I've

600
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,210
talked about only one particular and

601
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,980
unfortunately rather ignored piece of

602
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,450
the threat intelligence picture your

603
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,430
traditional threat intelligence

604
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,440
reporting still has quite a big role to

605
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:56,050
play as long as the sides are

606
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,750
cooperating because ideally what we want

607
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,760
is cyber threat intelligence provides

608
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,890
this big picture overview this in-depth

609
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,330
analysis of what the adversary is what

610
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,640
they do who they might be

611
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,679
and then combines that with the security

612
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,630
operations team who provides that

613
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:15,190
day-to-day defense of the network to

614
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:17,200
result in a real near real-time very

615
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,940
much operationally focused threat

616
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,820
intelligence indications and warning

617
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,160
that enables active real realistic

618
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,720
defense within the environment so to

619
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,850
illustrate this a little bit I'm going

620
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,460
to talk about two examples both of which

621
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,260
I worked on in my own shop for drago's

622
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,910
but have a lot of other

623
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,640
public commentary on them so crash

624
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:39,130
override and destroyer the 2016 Ukraine

625
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,320
power event and then the Shamoon three

626
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:44,560
event and its potential relationship to

627
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,510
apt 33 which I think is also helix

628
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,010
kitten I might be wrong on that

629
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,440
I don't know crowd strikes names as well

630
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:53,620
but anyway crash over I didn't destroy

631
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,290
her so January 2016 lights went out in

632
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:59,169
Ukraine for the second year in a row

633
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:02,170
lots of media reporting and then black

634
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:04,180
cat talks blogs etc that is Robert

635
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,680
Lipowski from ESET I presented it

636
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:09,070
onstage with him at blackhat USA about

637
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,110
this back in July of 2017 August of 2017

638
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,520
whenever that was so it sounds like an

639
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,280
event that we knew a lot about you know

640
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,800
we had lots of reporting and newspapers

641
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,660
etc but if we look at how this event

642
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,450
played out did we really do a good job

643
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:25,180
so the event itself happened in December

644
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,250
of 2016 at the time there were

645
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,220
suspicions that oh did this happen again

646
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,050
because we had the 2015 power event but

647
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,440
there was no information sharing no one

648
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,510
really knew what happened unto mm excuse

649
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,360
me until in January he started getting

650
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:43,360
sources news articles from like reuters

651
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,530
and from other services that Ukraine was

652
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,530
convinced that this was a cyberattack

653
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,450
but still no information for why they

654
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,129
knew that at least none public so I can

655
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,300
say from a private perspective since I

656
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,950
was still in the US government at the

657
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,409
time that we were kind of confused what

658
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,910
was going on within weeks and months of

659
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,290
that event as well like well we think

660
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,300
this might be happening but we're not

661
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:04,030
really sure so if you were another

662
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,070
electric utility in Ukraine or in Poland

663
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,260
close to Ukraine or in the United States

664
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,760
you didn't know what was going on and

665
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,010
how to defend yourself against a similar

666
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,090
sort of attack if this even was a cyber

667
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:18,310
attack it wasn't until in June of 2017

668
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:21,070
late June it that that ESET D'Andre goes

669
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,990
published in-depth reporting on the

670
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,580
malware of what the crash override and

671
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,410
destroyer framework did how it

672
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,409
manipulated electric distribution

673
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:31,660
operations so it was really good from

674
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,550
ICS now our standpoint but again if I

675
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,860
was a network defender responsible for

676
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,120
defending an electric utility yeah I

677
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,189
know what to see when crash override

678
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,110
gets in the environment the very last

679
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,030
stage of the attack but I have no idea

680
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,919
what led up to making that attack

681
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,240
possible so from a defensive standpoint

682
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,760
I'm still disadvantaged

683
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,110
it wasn't until October of 2018 that at

684
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,580
least publicly among other things I

685
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,780
published a white paper which could be

686
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,970
viewed online or whatever and gave some

687
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,100
presentations about the attack lifecycle

688
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,560
in question how the attack was actually

689
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,030
facilitated how initial access into the

690
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,710
industrial control environment was

691
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,960
achieved what the adversary did to move

692
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,880
around all those necessary steps you

693
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,770
would need from a defender standpoint to

694
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,620
stop something like crash override or in

695
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:17,230
destroyer from affecting your operations

696
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:20,169
in the first place so if we look at this

697
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,060
from a raw data sharing standpoint we

698
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,650
were almost a complete failure there

699
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:28,240
were hashes available in June of 2017

700
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,700
but that was seven months after the

701
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,790
attack took place hashes are trivially

702
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:36,010
easy to change and are very brittle or

703
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,810
very easy to adjust or whatever and so

704
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,760
from a defensive standpoint you're not

705
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:41,740
leading people with much to respond to

706
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,230
and thus there wasn't really any

707
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,180
information to allow for that whole of

708
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,980
kill chain whole of attack perspective

709
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,190
until almost two years after the attack

710
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,420
took place for defenders to act on from

711
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,160
an indications in the warning

712
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,830
perspective we might have eventually had

713
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,530
a success in that we were able to inform

714
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,899
operators and asset owners of how this

715
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:04,149
attacks like a look place but it wasn't

716
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,400
until a long time after the event itself

717
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:09,130
actually happened so anyone who is

718
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,330
seeing crash over like crash override

719
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:16,030
like precursors before October of 2018

720
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:17,230
was kind of left at the mercy of the

721
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,149
adversary without having that

722
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,710
information from an intelligence

723
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,920
perspective if we look at intelligence

724
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:26,290
trying to provide a backward-looking

725
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,330
overview of the event in its entirety we

726
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,790
need to do a bad job you know the

727
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,290
initial reporting and some of the

728
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:34,389
initial aspects of the malware was ok

729
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,740
once we got a fuller picture of what was

730
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,480
going on and access to more data

731
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,100
enriched that a little bit more so that

732
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,440
was good but like we've said earlier

733
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,959
from the perspective of a actual

734
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,070
electric utility defender it doesn't

735
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,040
make a difference at that point because

736
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,720
we could have had the same adversary

737
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,220
operating in other environments and

738
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,560
insufficient information was available

739
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,770
to let them know what to look for for

740
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,510
molera TAC ok so I fell on my sword for

741
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,250
that one because I think myself Drago's

742
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,658
we could have done a better job

743
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,009
not going to speak for anyone else or

744
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:04,870
whatever but you know just things that

745
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:06,940
we need to think about another example a

746
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:10,418
little bit more recently so in December

747
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:13,539
of 2018 we had the third round of the

748
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:15,850
Shamoon wiper attack took taking place

749
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:17,169
in Saudi Arabia a little different and

750
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,809
that the entities that were attacked

751
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:21,279
were foreign owned entities operating

752
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:23,529
within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as

753
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,970
opposed to Saudi entities themselves but

754
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:27,610
again those are minor details we can

755
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,139
speak about over beers later the main

756
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,059
thing is that this was covered all over

757
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:33,070
the place Sherman itself hadn't really

758
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,899
changed all that much so everyone jumped

759
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,668
on this immediately like haha we saw

760
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:39,340
Shamoon again but what was interesting

761
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:40,990
about this is that a few weeks after the

762
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,830
initial reporting of like Shamoon

763
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,750
happened again

764
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,360
McAfee came out with some public

765
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:50,169
reporting that linked what was observed

766
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:53,320
to a advanced persistent threat labeled

767
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,909
apt 33 by fire I we call them the

768
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,220
McNally I'm at Drago's because we all

769
00:27:54,909 --> 00:28:01,659
have to have our own names um another

770
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:04,059
topic but linked apt 33 activity in the

771
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:05,559
year or longer prior to the Shamoon

772
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:08,139
event as being the precursor to

773
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,779
deploying the wiper framework oh that's

774
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:12,219
very interesting from a defender

775
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:14,919
standpoint I would have wanted to know

776
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,389
that or know some indications of that

777
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,639
that might take place because then I

778
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:21,908
could react appropriately to seeing apt

779
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:25,799
33 activity and then shortly after that

780
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:28,149
fire I publicly released a report that

781
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:34,269
confirmed more or less what was reported

782
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:36,729
by a McAfee or McAfee x' okay

783
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:38,559
projectors going up and down sorry but

784
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,419
that sort of confirmed McAfee is

785
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,428
reporting it yes like we saw this or

786
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:45,429
whatever they gave it a name overruled

787
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:47,919
or that apt 33 operations did seem to be

788
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:49,389
precursors to deploying Shamoon within

789
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,610
victim networks like oh that's really

790
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:53,949
cool except at this point you already

791
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:57,758
have networks that were wiped let's B

792
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:59,860
does that to you so and I had a caveat

793
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,110
to this actually so I do not know what

794
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,418
fire eyes private reporting was so if

795
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,258
you're a fire eyesight's subscriber you

796
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:06,940
may have been fine

797
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:08,110
this is a public reporting item and

798
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,399
there's the argument like well you only

799
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,678
get what you pay for and if it's free

800
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:13,939
like you know good luck to you

801
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,889
but anyway from the standpoint of

802
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:19,100
did we do a good job I mean maybe we did

803
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:21,590
so reporting was fairly good and coming

804
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,449
out almost in real time in reaction to

805
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,580
events which is good but we're talking

806
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:28,250
about a wiper here and one that spread

807
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,629
fairly widely within Victim networks so

808
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,399
it's one thing that you know hey you

809
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:33,709
know a day later after I got hit by

810
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,059
another version of this truck wiper this

811
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,740
is what happened like well my networks

812
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:38,509
already wipes you hadn't helped me at

813
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,850
all you just gave me a reason why my

814
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:44,059
network is wiped so that might be less

815
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,379
than helpful but again the caveat I

816
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:46,700
don't know what the private eye site

817
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:48,379
reporting may have been so maybe for

818
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,000
fireEye customers this was very valuable

819
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:52,189
because they were getting an indication

820
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,110
of hey we see this entity getting into

821
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,789
networks not 100% sure what they're

822
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,959
doing but here's what's happening so you

823
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:59,029
could be prepared for whatever may come

824
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,070
next but what we could have done better

825
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:03,980
really depends on the accuracy of that

826
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:05,570
apt 33 attribution because from a public

827
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,029
reporting standpoint at least and some

828
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,918
private reporting that I'm familiar with

829
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:11,779
while this entity had been tracked

830
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,090
somewhat hadn't been tracked very well

831
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:16,370
that you know oh we know they're active

832
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,379
we can say that their tactics are trashy

833
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,729
and they're very noisy and easy to

834
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:21,709
follow we won't pay attention to them

835
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,889
that much and then they end up deploying

836
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:26,779
a wiper bow ok that's pretty bad so what

837
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,639
we needed to do is really provide better

838
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:30,889
indications of what this entity was up

839
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:32,240
to within networks so that victims in

840
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:34,699
question could have responded to those

841
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,950
potential intrusions well in advance of

842
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,289
this adversary being in place to just

843
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,240
deploy a wiper widespread and victim

844
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:43,970
networks resulting in significant

845
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,519
dislocation so let's wrap this up I

846
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,019
think I have a little bit more time

847
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,019
where are we right now so really what we

848
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:53,990
need to do is inw bridges a critical gap

849
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:55,519
between raw data which can lead us down

850
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,679
wrong paths because we don't have enough

851
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,120
information behind it yet and finalized

852
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,429
threat intelligence reporting which

853
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,529
perhaps is waits too long before we're

854
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:05,990
able to do anything valuable with the

855
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:07,789
information in question security

856
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,409
operations benefit from this because now

857
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:11,570
your 'suck while they're not getting

858
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,009
data instantaneously that's not called

859
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,408
good threat intelligence that's called

860
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:18,590
magic but what they are getting is in

861
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:20,240
fairly real-time information about what

862
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,699
it is that they're seeing to better

863
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,519
respond to events as they take place as

864
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,800
a result of that they can do their jobs

865
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,870
better they can identify like Oh

866
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,430
see weird communication coming out of

867
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,020
the network like oh you know I

868
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,870
understand maps on to registration

869
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,879
patterns similar to what fancy bearer is

870
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,469
known to use so this is more than just a

871
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,210
weird network connection this is

872
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,550
potentially very bad see - and I should

873
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,320
act accordingly but the thing is is that

874
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,090
and I say this as someone who works

875
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,790
within the cyber threat intelligence

876
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:52,100
industry is that has an industry and

877
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:54,800
even as dedicated shops within companies

878
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,750
we don't do a very good job of actually

879
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,220
putting this into practice everyone

880
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,380
wants to emphasize the sharing of the

881
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,190
IRCs and everyone wants to put their

882
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,750
hang their hat on writing the very fancy

883
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,950
1020 hundred page report I don't know

884
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:10,400
why no one reads the hundred page report

885
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:13,390
but you get it so the thing is is that

886
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,210
in order for inw become a concept that

887
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:19,700
does end up helping the sock enabling

888
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,140
better defense is that CTI has to buy in

889
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,420
that this is something that we need to

890
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,730
do whether that means embedding analysts

891
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,650
within the work center or some other

892
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,690
action that we really need to start

893
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,550
embracing the idea of bridging that gap

894
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,990
between just collecting the raw data and

895
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,360
then writing up something lengthy about

896
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,980
it weeks or months later so what can you

897
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,209
do this is kind of like the most

898
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,070
important slide like oh that was very

899
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,540
nice Joe thank you for telling me what

900
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,730
do I actually do about this well among

901
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,830
other things from an analyst perspective

902
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,870
we need to lose some measure of pride

903
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,580
that instead of just like oh let the

904
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,929
machine generated iOS C's go out we

905
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,000
don't care about those I want to write

906
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,670
the big report and make a name for

907
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,660
myself and give a black cat talk or a

908
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,700
recon talk or something along those

909
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,280
lines like no your defenders really need

910
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,830
you to do this sort of work so it's not

911
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,600
just a question of getting your you know

912
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,790
rolling one sleeves up and diving into

913
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,090
the data to do that correlation in

914
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,889
near-real-time but also being more open

915
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,449
to yeah I don't know the complete

916
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,940
picture yet but here's what I know right

917
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,680
now this might change a little bit but

918
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,630
based upon what I've gathered and what

919
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,800
we already know here's something for you

920
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:26,030
my sock tier-2 defender can take action

921
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,399
for within what we're seeing in the

922
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:30,379
environment right now sharing groups

923
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,820
also can buy into this a little bit as

924
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,500
well so I don't know who here is part of

925
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,050
like a nice sack or you start talking

926
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,210
about the national level certs many of

927
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:40,399
these organizations are organized just

928
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,299
like private sector CTI providers where

929
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,090
you have one

930
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:45,499
the VOCs sometimes shared

931
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,139
semi-automatically and then over your

932
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:49,190
reports and nothing in the middle

933
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:51,498
sharing groups need to open themselves

934
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,899
up to better communication and find

935
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:55,700
mechanisms to share not just you know

936
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:57,258
those two types of information but

937
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,610
events as they're happening to the

938
00:33:57,259 --> 00:33:59,929
benefit of defenders because otherwise

939
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,908
you're putting people at a disadvantage

940
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:03,379
we're all of two attackers that have

941
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:05,330
much quicker development cycles than we

942
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:07,270
do unfortunately and we get behind the

943
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,159
curve finally from a vendor perspective

944
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,569
you know we as vendors need to get

945
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,250
comfortable with reporting before the

946
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:15,770
whole story so this is something at

947
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,230
Drago's that I've put together is that

948
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,879
yes we were released reporting within 24

949
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,379
hours or so of observing something

950
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,029
knowing that we don't have the full

951
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:25,940
picture and letting our customers know

952
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,349
that hey you know this might change it

953
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,970
might not be accurate right now but

954
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:31,669
here's things as we see them at this

955
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:33,379
moment more plan can do this this is

956
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:34,940
something that I did in the Navy when it

957
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:36,828
came to things like tracking radar

958
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,690
signatures for example it allows

959
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:40,579
defenders to at least get part of the

960
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,109
picture to begin taking some informed

961
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,609
response even if they don't know

962
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:45,918
necessarily where everything is going

963
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,449
and then you know along those lines

964
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,730
tailor products at different customer

965
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:51,770
needs - many times it seems that threat

966
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,899
intelligence products are really geared

967
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,730
towards one audience the strategic

968
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,500
audience this is what the Chinese are

969
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,819
doing in with relation to intellectual

970
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,890
property theft across these five

971
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:04,339
industries that's really fascinating to

972
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:06,410
read but if I'm the watch person or the

973
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:08,599
incident responder or the security

974
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,920
operations center person I don't care

975
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,540
about that so much because it doesn't

976
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,480
impact my day-to-day operations that

977
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,970
much so as customers we can put pressure

978
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,380
on vendors to say hey this report is

979
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,240
very interesting but it's interesting

980
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,589
for not the people who are actually

981
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,419
responding to events on a day-to-day

982
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:26,660
basis can you help me out by providing

983
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,190
something a little bit more and last

984
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,170
thing I forgot - for what we could do as

985
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,579
analysts you know one of the things that

986
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,440
I did when I was running an incident

987
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:35,569
response team and not doing dedicated

988
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,400
threat intelligence operations is I

989
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:39,440
didn't care about the IOC s unless I

990
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,210
could take that iOS C and either pull

991
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,589
the malware myself from virustotal or

992
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:46,700
pull the domain from a risk IQ or you

993
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:48,410
know something else along those lines

994
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,939
and actually analyze it myself because I

995
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:51,649
realized that I wasn't getting the

996
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,329
detailed information necessary to

997
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,040
actually take action on it what the

998
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,540
malware does how it behaves how it

999
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,580
ties into other campaigns the hash

1000
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,050
didn't tell me that so as consumers for

1001
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,670
the time being until everyone else

1002
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,020
catches up that's kind of what we need

1003
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,480
to do ourselves because no one's helping

1004
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,380
us out or supporting us with that sort

1005
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,960
of work for us

1006
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,490
so what we're all turnit looking to do

1007
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,810
is again you know trying to find

1008
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,459
something that's timely that we're

1009
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:16,520
getting information in sufficient time

1010
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,320
to inform and enable our operations

1011
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,509
personnel to take defensive actions

1012
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,040
that's descriptive that just just

1013
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,260
doesn't say that this hash is bad this

1014
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,050
IP address is bad but no this IP address

1015
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:29,060
is being used for a encoded form of c2

1016
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,580
associated with this threat actor that

1017
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,670
behaves in this way that told me enough

1018
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,319
in a sentence or two for me to take a

1019
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,640
very informed response to what it is

1020
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,530
that I'm observing in the environment

1021
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,940
and lastly needs to be actionable

1022
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,650
so just because I observe something what

1023
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,960
does that mean being able to tie that

1024
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,790
back to a certain type of adversary a

1025
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,340
certain type of method of behavior means

1026
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:51,200
that I can then begin anticipating what

1027
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,600
defensive responses are necessary in

1028
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,250
order to counteract that adversary so

1029
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,330
that's all that I have I have some time

1030
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,660
for questions

1031
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:01,850
I think the podium actually I'm not sure

1032
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,500
what timing we're on right now if we

1033
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,420
have time for questions or not five

1034
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,640
minutes for questions if not or if you'd

1035
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,140
rather speak offline I will be around

1036
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,029
the conference and you could certainly

1037
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:19,879
hit me up through various means but we

1038
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:21,470
had a question hi I'm okay without the

1039
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,890
mic I'll repeat the question for the

1040
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,890
audience too

1041
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:36,380
I think it does to a certain extent

1042
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:38,960
depending upon industry I think the

1043
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,000
financial sector has probably done the

1044
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,160
best amount of work I know I am NOT as

1045
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,600
familiar I know some of the UK

1046
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,149
organizations and I'm fairly familiar

1047
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,740
with North American operations has done

1048
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,330
a reasonably good job in coming together

1049
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,310
to do some of what I talked about in

1050
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:54,980
terms of not just sharing but trying to

1051
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,509
share valuable information and I think

1052
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,040
the important lesson from that is that

1053
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,540
none of that was required instead the

1054
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,400
financial institutions took a look at

1055
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,140
the environments like oh my god we're

1056
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,270
losing money and no one's helping us we

1057
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,740
have to do something about this in other

1058
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,509
sectors especially when you start

1059
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,049
talking about sectors that deal with a

1060
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,310
question of both proprietary and

1061
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,570
reputational issues about being breached

1062
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,920
whereas everyone assumes the banks are

1063
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,500
always gonna get breached or someone's

1064
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,060
always gonna try and breach the banks

1065
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,800
you start talking about technology

1066
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,970
companies or utility companies I know

1067
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,130
one wants to know that they got breached

1068
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:27,620
because that sounds really bad that it's

1069
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:28,640
probably gonna take someone forcing to a

1070
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,500
certain extent to make that happen

1071
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,220
unless organizations can be more

1072
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,200
comfortable with real understanding the

1073
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,879
need and then doing so voluntarily and

1074
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,129
then being willing to open up to each

1075
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,370
other to show what's going on though I

1076
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:45,170
hope that helped fine okay there was

1077
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:53,930
another question in the back I thought I

1078
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:58,250
saw a hand earlier hey Joe marching from

1079
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:59,870
fire I advanced practices yeah you

1080
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,720
mentioned in one of your first slides

1081
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:05,180
that from indications and warnings

1082
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,839
perspective the capabilities of malware

1083
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,879
shouldn't be relevant to the incident

1084
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,450
response team but would you agree with

1085
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,750
me that when you're responding to a wipe

1086
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:21,379
out malware destructive piece of code it

1087
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:23,000
actually matters right yes yes yes so in

1088
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,850
that case I either misspoke or there was

1089
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,740
a misunderstanding so the distinction

1090
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,930
I'm drawing is the intention versus

1091
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,540
capabilities if that makes sense so yes

1092
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:35,750
if I know that this piece of malware

1093
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:37,759
either is or is the prerequisite to or

1094
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:40,730
link to an adversary that does a wiper

1095
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,640
or crypto mining or you know something

1096
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,990
else or whatever

1097
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,450
it's important that tells me what

1098
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:47,788
something does what's less important is

1099
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,779
why it doesn't I was what I was trying

1100
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:49,440
to get at so thank you for asking that

1101
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:50,910
question

1102
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,390
others had that take you confusion

1103
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:56,399
because yes the why yes looking back I

1104
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,500
care but in the immediate sense of

1105
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,299
responding to it whether it's mandiant

1106
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,799
is going out or advanced practices is

1107
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:03,720
looking at something in real time like

1108
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,339
we'll figure that out later but the

1109
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,899
capability aspect is most important

1110
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:08,190
because that's gonna tell me both what I

1111
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,859
need to do right now and what I need to

1112
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,480
expect later from the defense so it

1113
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:23,640
makes perfect sense thanks okay yeah

1114
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:25,559
thank you for asking that okay I think

1115
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,910
that's all I will be around thank you

1116
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:28,859
everyone for sitting through this and

1117
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,390
for dealing with you know inviting me to

1118
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:32,578
speak in English and Poland so because

1119
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:35,120
my your English is a lot better than my

1120
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:37,719
polish so thank you very much everyone

1121
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,719
[Applause]
