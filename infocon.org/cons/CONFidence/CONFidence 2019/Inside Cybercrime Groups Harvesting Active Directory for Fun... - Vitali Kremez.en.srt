1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,590
I definitely didn't

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:15,920
and do have anything to do with Trend

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:17,570
Micro just FYI so so just like really so

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,490
the topic of the presentation we chose

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,440
to go with a kind of inside cyber crime

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,500
groups that you know harvest Active

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,019
Directory for fun and profit so really

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,240
quick introduction but myself Who am I

9
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:31,519
so my name is Vitaly creminis it's also

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,129
my twitter handle i I do lots of like

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,600
malware research and some analysis I

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,460
used to work for some like government

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,410
companies in the US government entities

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,270
in the US and private companies as well

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,699
so I've been doing that for quite some

16
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,590
time and but one of my interest was in

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,680
this research to identify how

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,320
sophisticated groups essentially target

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,850
huge corporations and networks what's

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,550
the latest tactic techniques and

21
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,230
procedures and methods they use and here

22
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,059
it's also was inspired by the group we

23
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,500
call trig but if you might be familiar

24
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,000
with trig but it's one of the most

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,519
prolific groups we've been tracking on

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,700
the financial or crime landscape so I'm

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,530
gonna start so the talk outline we're

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,020
gonna bigger will cover through this

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,240
whole entire presentation we'll talk who

30
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,679
this cybercrime groups as we track I'm

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,048
or refer to them as cyber crime

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,159
enterprises because so sophisticated and

33
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:24,229
how persistent they are we'll talk more

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,689
about how trig but in the cloud we'll

35
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:29,450
talk more one of the like largest breach

36
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:31,939
cases we be tracking in the US I'm also

37
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,860
leaving us and so we have a company

38
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:36,139
called cloud jumper if you might be

39
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,189
familiar it's not really the dragon from

40
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,930
the movie but it's a company that

41
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,880
actually manages cloud infrastructure

42
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,009
and domains for other companies

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,939
so we'll cover that we'll talk more also

44
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:48,890
on what the most common Active Directory

45
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,479
enumeration exploitation techniques will

46
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,610
leap through the hive then we're gonna

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,039
go and leap through the lifecycle of one

48
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,049
of the major events and how actually the

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,790
attacks work from the inside and from

50
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,170
attackers side because that's one of the

51
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,090
most interesting TTP's we've been

52
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,640
tracking no talk will cover also

53
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,170
detection mitigations and we're going to

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,538
talk more about also the key takeaways

55
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,369
of course and i'll mention some of the

56
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,980
defensive mechanism we can use both from

57
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,380
the defensive side and attacker side to

58
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:20,239
exploit active directory for fun and

59
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,500
profit so really i want to just dive

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,780
deeper into what's the

61
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,790
state of cybercrime Enterprise or I

62
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,040
would say what's the current state of

63
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,870
that you know in 21st century long

64
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,060
before ago there was a malware called

65
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,520
Zeus banking malware that's dive into

66
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,720
the space of malware is a service since

67
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,640
then there's a like very sophisticated

68
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,560
groups emerged one of them was called

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,119
Dyer one is also trick about the dry

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,040
decks and they are more of a like

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,210
cybercrime enterprises and they all I

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,370
call the division of labor

73
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,930
they have different people do specific

74
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,420
roles for them they also employ

75
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,070
additional botnet operators actually

76
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,649
highly recommend I will do the keynote

77
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,239
before for besides in Charleston

78
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,280
actually talking more about the

79
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,110
evolution of criminal intent and what's

80
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,580
going on from the intelligence side can

81
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,200
I also background before I used to do

82
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,209
lots of intelligence work for both

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,739
private and government entities looking

84
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,540
into those groups so what's an

85
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,610
interesting thing we've seen is these

86
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,070
groups are I like dealing with lots of

87
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,380
big big data problems like as all of us

88
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,720
are so they don't really care more about

89
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,820
like your average installs infections

90
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,220
they care more about high-value targets

91
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,410
we called HVT so the targets where the

92
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,940
corporate domains sophisticated bank

93
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,980
network environments and additional

94
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,200
infrastructure because of the way they

95
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,820
do that they need like really good parts

96
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,768
and mechanisms or like identifying

97
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,780
mechanism to identify those high-value

98
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,310
installs and they also kind of rely on

99
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,019
some additional malware groups like for

100
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,380
example a motet if you might be familiar

101
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:44,600
one of the most active loader loaders a

102
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,160
service that sells installs to other

103
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,079
groups so they capable to load an

104
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,540
additional malware so they very have

105
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,519
robust and huge huge network of people

106
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,790
who help them so what they're looking

107
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,220
for

108
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,959
like mention here is like the the

109
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,680
solutions to identify and the idea is

110
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,660
pretty simple

111
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,910
how can you monetize all of those

112
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,239
infections how can you squeeze the last

113
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,200
euro dollar from your BOTS right and and

114
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,000
so they have to try to apply different

115
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,609
approaches one of them is of course

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,440
banking malware so it's a classical men

117
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,180
and the men in the middle attack or you

118
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,459
log into the website and you just can be

119
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,160
either redirected or web injected to

120
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,228
steal credentials or you know credential

121
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,660
stealer they'd also dive into minor so

122
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,460
XMR Manero minor was also used by them

123
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,210
and now it's around somewhere near and

124
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,440
summer is like one of the most

125
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,900
interesting things because they've been

126
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,580
very very successful it's very smart

127
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,080
because once they are inside the huge

128
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,400
corporate networks they can not only

129
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,840
steal all credentials but also

130
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,599
Lorenza weren't asked for a lot of money

131
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,280
up to this date I'll cover more that the

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,440
groups actually asked one of the victims

133
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,780
five billion dollars in the u.s. so he

134
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,759
will see that more so and it's pretty

135
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,590
simple and how little a like what the

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,389
solution was for them how would they

137
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,280
identify what's the most interesting

138
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,750
bots you know imagine this if you're

139
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,049
running a botnet you want to know like

140
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,550
what's important what's not so and they

141
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,440
were thinking about this and what we

142
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,000
realized also from the Windows and

143
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,919
Microsoft instrumentations in the way we

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,410
manage infrastructure it's critical that

145
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,120
we rely on Active Directory I think you

146
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,190
know if you're a network admin or you

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,810
automate tasks you push patches updates

148
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,389
through that systems and criminals

149
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,789
realize that - they realize that that

150
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,919
will be a great idea just to look start

151
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,990
looking for that and this is kind of

152
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,210
like the kind of the evolution of the

153
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,400
trick bots or the groups behind it it's

154
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,530
a mix of both automation when the people

155
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,049
essentially use automated malware like

156
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,659
mo tat trick but but they also use some

157
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,970
human network exploitation factors I

158
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,320
call them so like for example when they

159
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,699
identify this is a typical chain

160
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,310
actually and this is kind of ryuk

161
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:44,880
ransomware if you familiar with Ryu kids

162
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,180
also character from guess cartoon Death

163
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,219
Note

164
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,979
so they also borrowed the name from that

165
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,470
and so this is a chain they use a motet

166
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,659
as a loader for trick but installs which

167
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,099
is a banking malware but on steroids but

168
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,330
it also then where you could brand some

169
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:59,099
more and the way they do the whole chain

170
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,840
through PowerShell Empire close the

171
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,520
traffic and I will will dive deeper into

172
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,979
that but this is the current most

173
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,080
successful models we've seen exploiting

174
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,820
and targeting huge corporations Bank

175
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,849
environments counties and governments in

176
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,440
the US and all over the world so the

177
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:15,360
solution to that problem that they've

178
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,370
been dealing with for so long how do you

179
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,580
identify squeeze more value from BOTS

180
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,710
and just be successful you just look for

181
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,539
network and Active Directory so you

182
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,820
identify machines that have domain

183
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,050
controller exfiltrated data from the

184
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,120
main controller identify what's the

185
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,380
domains and the forest and trees and all

186
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,449
that I'll dive deeper into the high

187
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,099
level what's the LDAP protocol

188
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:36,539
lightweight directory protocol works and

189
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,270
what's the active directory but but this

190
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:41,070
is primarily what they realized so

191
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,448
network allows them to identify once

192
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,340
they're inside the big network and get

193
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,960
20 domains and because this will be the

194
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,849
interesting infections for them to

195
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,138
exploit further and they would sell it

196
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:51,810
or give it to somebody

197
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,409
groups to monetize them very clever

198
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,090
actually

199
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:58,379
and it enables them to be very

200
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,969
successful so and just like you know

201
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,650
just do what's the what's the scope of

202
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,449
the problem like we're talking about and

203
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,099
just you know sis kind of some some maps

204
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,080
as I've been tracking this is pretty

205
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,060
much very accurate representation of

206
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,680
some of the latest trig but in stalls

207
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,199
I'm not talking about this spam levels

208
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,460
with spam levels are exceeding that but

209
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,740
you can see there's an actual infection

210
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,349
so a certain day but they were they

211
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,840
might have between 500 to 5,000

212
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:24,779
infections per day they also spend their

213
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,549
themselves so use their own like spam

214
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,279
spam mailer but else your lion ditional

215
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,479
groups like Imhotep to install it

216
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,129
essentially and this is kind of like

217
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,650
some of the trends I've been tracking on

218
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,330
on the on the malware side another

219
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,919
interesting things that now in the days

220
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,568
of like anti-spam things it's really

221
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,948
important to find a good spammer so

222
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,870
they're definitely pursuing that track

223
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,240
and that's why they use emote that for

224
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,460
example as a loader for that so the

225
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,740
problem is pretty huge they definitely

226
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,150
see between a lot of infections and some

227
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,339
of the most protected companies in the

228
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,109
world with all the EDR with all the

229
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,339
latest antivirus solutions they've been

230
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,529
hit by trick BOTS and they've been

231
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:02,279
pretty much compromised many many many

232
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:03,779
many of those so go Winx the next slide

233
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,399
so this is kind of like to give you

234
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,860
another like connect to the real-world

235
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,050
scenario so there was a big case

236
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,159
recently other tracking just share some

237
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,990
of the public information that's

238
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,909
available so right you could rent

239
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,740
somewhere it's in the news the hit the

240
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:19,949
cloud MSP managed service provider

241
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,180
called cloud cloud jumper essentially

242
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:23,370
and that's kind of like the problems

243
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,810
we've been seeing as we go into cloud we

244
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,490
think the cloud are protected secured

245
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,680
and managed by somebody else but what

246
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,819
are they getting compromised they're

247
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,830
essentially the gates through other

248
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,949
victim environments and managed like

249
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,598
systems so that's what the Dino that's

250
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,088
where the issue is and of course with

251
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,440
the news like we probe reach and other

252
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,599
things we think about the third-party

253
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,760
risk what are they are in fact it right

254
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,440
so intrigued but is very good and the

255
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,189
group behind it it monetized in that

256
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,890
aspect

257
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,029
so getting to third-party pivoting back

258
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,500
from that environment two additional

259
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,449
ones and we'll dive deeper into the

260
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,839
cloud jumper Cades another another

261
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:59,790
interesting thing here was that that

262
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,949
there was a of course you know maybe

263
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,180
heard of the Los Angeles Times it's and

264
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:06,030
many many more publish

265
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,560
was infected by group ryuk initially

266
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,600
there was media speculation that might

267
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,339
be North Korea involved because they

268
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,950
thought the phantom code overlap with

269
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,510
Hermes ransomware obviously no it's just

270
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,150
a trick but group got inside

271
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,069
so and it was a major actually blowback

272
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,620
like we like the newspapers didn't

273
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,470
really go live because all the cloud

274
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,360
infrastructure was really locked or

275
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,400
encrypted and they're asking for a

276
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,590
ridiculous number of bitcoins in US

277
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,319
dollars so well over actually over

278
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,510
600,000 big points so it's very very

279
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,070
huge case it highlights that the how

280
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,420
shriek but gets into the cloud I guess

281
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,420
and we'll talk more what's the initial

282
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,810
attack vector on that specific intrusion

283
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,750
is so I call it like trig but in a cloud

284
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,060
right so this is the cloud jumper MSP

285
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,980
intrusion breach it's actually it's in

286
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,310
the news but it's not widely covered yet

287
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,810
but because because of the lasting

288
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,910
consequence to this which we might see

289
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,670
even more victims coming out of that and

290
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,110
as we see daily so for example this is

291
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,030
the statement made by one of the

292
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,400
presidents of the company who said that

293
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,810
hey we've been hit by ryuk the only

294
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,130
server you could because the systems

295
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,619
were impacted by you but we all know

296
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,610
ryuk is trick but group so as I

297
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,410
mentioned earlier right you cuz

298
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,600
ransomware so they've been hit by ryuk

299
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,790
they ask like we know all the customer

300
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,560
base approx they claim the breach was

301
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,209
essentially was a third party connector

302
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,890
they connected to the cloud jumper

303
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,020
network that was there already infected

304
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,060
and wanst inside infected some of the

305
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,699
customer environments so if you guys use

306
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,319
cloud jumper be aware I guess that's

307
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,540
what was going on and they asked like

308
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,460
over 600,000 of bitcoins across all the

309
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,500
whole customer base think about this

310
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,750
cloud jumper breach as they breach into

311
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,580
met the master bridge the bridge into

312
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,070
the other environments and this is kind

313
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,720
of the statement they made they you know

314
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,340
they identified it and there's there's a

315
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,510
lot of interesting things that going on

316
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,650
with that because right you grant

317
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,060
somewhere per se it's one of the most

318
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,250
potent and one of them is interesting

319
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,160
ones because their encryption is not

320
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,960
decrypted and and they've been actually

321
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,230
quite professional the way they do do

322
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,330
things and this is kind of like the

323
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,190
premise of the talk and everything else

324
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,770
why Active Directory matters and

325
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,900
everything else so once we have instant

326
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,699
we got inside to MSP provider we are

327
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,350
pretty much doomed right because we all

328
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,030
use cloud service providers we

329
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,580
source all of it in the u.s. at the very

330
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,050
least we all like you know rely on

331
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,990
companies to manage our Active Directory

332
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,099
we expose our external infrastructure to

333
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,810
you some third parties

334
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,850
what kind of acoustic have a joke I was

335
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,410
also tracking some mage card groups the

336
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,450
credit card snakes came in so whenever

337
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,010
you upload somebody else is like either

338
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,330
JavaScript code or do something on your

339
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,250
website that you don't know about it's

340
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,050
not your website anymore it's not an

341
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,760
infrastructure whenever you delegate it

342
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,380
to some third parties and this is kind

343
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,750
of like the premise of this as we lose

344
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,270
control and in delegations over our

345
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:51,570
resources and it's of course the third

346
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:55,670
party risk so this is kind of like the

347
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,670
how the things are unfolding currently

348
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:01,290
and just to give you an idea if you guys

349
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,630
of course familiar it's more about

350
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,550
technical I guess medium difficulty talk

351
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,320
I want to make sure like we cover some

352
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,520
of the basics of Active Directory so

353
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,560
Active Directory you know if you're

354
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,660
doing pen tests or you doing engage in

355
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,790
some additional like management of

356
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,170
infrastructure you realize that Active

357
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,060
Directory once you're inside the main

358
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,740
controller it's you've got the keys to

359
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,109
the kingdom you get everything you need

360
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,670
so you can do both from the local

361
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,250
privilege escalation you can move across

362
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,290
you can identify scheduled tasks which

363
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,760
oftentimes contain hard-coded passwords

364
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,890
because that's how we do things we

365
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,770
humans we simplify many ways have we do

366
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,360
like a routine tasks so an active domain

367
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,750
controller that's exactly how it works

368
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,520
so you essentially it's a it's a Windows

369
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,710
instrumentation Network and I'll talk

370
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,660
more deeper into in a second from like a

371
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,760
technical side how they actually code

372
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:51,480
this and how does actually this active

373
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,160
directory ADSI windows API works so but

374
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,070
this is kind of primarily the key there

375
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,410
and in all the breaches we've seen

376
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,290
linked to either imitate trick but and

377
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,719
sophisticates the key the key thing was

378
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,610
the active directory exploitation so

379
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,750
once they're in they can do anything and

380
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,490
they can just push their additional

381
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,470
malware and host they can push rent

382
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,660
somewhere or they can pretty much there

383
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,760
they're the god the full god mode

384
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,459
essentially and that's that's also the

385
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,470
other criminal groups realize that and

386
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,330
this is just a slide I wanna just what I

387
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,130
really go a little bit deeper into some

388
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,910
technical analysis and just like some of

389
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,680
the code coke gigas code code contracts

390
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,670
is they use to code the same tools and

391
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,939
will

392
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:35,319
we'll stay in that for a second so this

393
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,970
is kind of like what's the techniques

394
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,610
the treatment uses so they rode their

395
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,130
own like domain 32 dll module actually I

396
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,650
wrote in my own blog back in 2017 we saw

397
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:46,300
the precursors of that coming and this

398
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,160
is kind of like the domain D level

399
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,380
modules essentially it's the module

400
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,939
meant to enumerate and essentially

401
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,460
identify some of the most interesting

402
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,980
like assets from domain controller so DC

403
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:00,760
so they didn't fight for specific XML

404
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,770
files printers users scheduled jobs and

405
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,170
everything else and essentially if you

406
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,670
guys familiar with C small so sucessful

407
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,349
essentially it's a shared folder and

408
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,819
domain controller so once whenever you

409
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,710
do in pen test everything else I highly

410
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,240
recommend for you to look for active

411
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,000
directory sucessful because Seussville

412
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,770
contains all the necessary but not all

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,350
of it but if it's not properly secured

414
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,090
you can get domain pretty quickly at any

415
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,980
company so and this is kind of by

416
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,750
default some of the method of operations

417
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,480
and it's focused this specific module

418
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,880
they drop in machines to look for active

419
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,470
directory they call domain grabber but a

420
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,740
very specific Active Directory domain

421
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,740
grabber

422
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,730
they have like both like I mentioned and

423
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,440
topic sure there's a hash I'll upload

424
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,610
the talk as well so we can go back as

425
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,530
well and research because there's a lot

426
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,510
of technical content here on top of this

427
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,990
this is how kind of essentially how it

428
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,460
works

429
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,770
so we have like a different you know

430
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,710
module with usual exports organelles etc

431
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:56,350
and it starts it makes nail def query my

432
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,420
Windows API and then it makes the I mean

433
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,710
I call it LDAP double unit calls where

434
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,079
it starts enumerate and connected to

435
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,700
resources and then tries to do a file

436
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,950
finder functions where it tries to

437
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,800
identify and enumerate XML trees within

438
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,930
the domains so this is kind of like how

439
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,160
it works and I very like of course my

440
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,449
presentation wouldn't be a presentation

441
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,140
if I would not include

442
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,700
Ida decompiled things but this is the C

443
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,890
small thing so here you can see that

444
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,990
they enumerate C small so which is

445
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,490
essentially their dinner identify hosts

446
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,470
try to see if they can connect to this

447
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,270
what I mentioned early c small is just a

448
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,620
folder just a folder on the main

449
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,089
controller and seeing if it's accessible

450
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,190
would enable them to be very successful

451
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:34,410
and they make connections they try to

452
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,670
connect auto-connect

453
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:40,150
collect the data and this is kind of

454
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:43,310
like this is again them hard to identify

455
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:46,100
those files of interest

456
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,018
and to even dive even deeper what

457
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,610
specific things you like in every

458
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,540
company in the world like does like

459
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,490
sophisticated Active Directory

460
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,469
management they always contain some of

461
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:58,639
those files for example schedule tasks

462
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:00,319
xml data sources printers

463
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,420
there's also users and everything else

464
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,889
so schedule tasks whenever you think

465
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,599
whenever you manage infrastructure from

466
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:08,899
x contains hard coded passwords

467
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,999
credentials you can name it it's because

468
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,709
the idea we never thought that well we

469
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:14,269
probably not we never thought that but

470
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:16,008
like we never realized how actually

471
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,839
lucrative for criminals to get inside

472
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:20,449
and get those XML trees and parse it and

473
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,100
use it for their own exploitation very

474
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:24,829
clever and I think that she took this

475
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,709
technique from one of the one of the pen

476
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:29,540
testing kind of articles before written

477
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:31,459
about how fruitful it is to exploit

478
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,899
Active Directory major corporations and

479
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:37,550
governments so this is that piece

480
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:39,889
another module they use for identifying

481
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,599
high-value target is call Network DLL

482
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,639
and other it's a DLL dynamic link

483
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,410
library file so whenever you get

484
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,569
infected with trig but they would

485
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,129
essentially download additional module

486
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:51,949
and the module is essentially the idea

487
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:54,589
of that just to query all the network

488
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:58,029
information and identify like around the

489
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:02,329
IP config all for example there on the

490
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:04,549
actually wql queries WMI and all that

491
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:05,629
stuff and other things they is try to

492
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:07,250
establish trust which is kind of

493
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,319
interesting I've never seen that before

494
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,909
before they actually query the LDAP the

495
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,648
lightweight directory protocol Active

496
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:14,689
Directory they try to establish trust

497
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:16,579
between domains so you can see NL tests

498
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:19,610
so you want to see what the trust level

499
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:21,619
between machines in the network in the

500
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,418
forest and domains and then once

501
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,010
information is collected it will be sent

502
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:27,559
over to them and their back-end and they

503
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,059
can just search themselves so and I'll

504
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:33,020
show you how it actually looks like from

505
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:35,059
their side and yeah so that's primarily

506
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,158
the module that was like was super

507
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:39,289
active super useful for them and edifies

508
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:42,470
high-value targets very reliably and

509
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:44,510
routinely this is like primarily like I

510
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,890
want to focus on the LDAP I'll they

511
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,809
applied where directory network and

512
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,669
domain queries so you can see there is a

513
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:51,918
LDAP connection is being made here

514
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,899
essentially it's an LDAP protocol or you

515
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,160
know in a way you communicate HTTP but

516
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:58,500
you can communicate via LDAP

517
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,840
and is essentially queries they make

518
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,670
computers and forests users and forests

519
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,439
and in a forest essentially it's a way

520
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,360
for you denta Fido main part of the net

521
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,120
back to directory this is kind of a good

522
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:13,080
the terminology to use domain forests

523
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:16,830
and and this is kind of like all the

524
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,570
information they collect so you can see

525
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,010
that's a very extensive data about every

526
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,870
single machine once they're inside

527
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,460
before they deploy ransomware before

528
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,590
they stage into and prepare for

529
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,090
additional exploitation phase they

530
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,620
already down lots of reconnaissance I

531
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,240
would call it more reconnaissance

532
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,469
modules because they're not you know

533
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,150
they collect all the data but they're

534
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,800
not meant to be like malicious on their

535
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,630
own and that's where we're kind of like

536
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,659
the key part as I mentioned earlier were

537
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,280
we see automations of collections of all

538
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,860
the data forest trees domain controller

539
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,389
names and users IP addresses but then

540
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,969
also connecting with in sophisticated

541
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,680
network breach actors who can go inside

542
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,660
deploy additional modules and ryuk

543
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,760
ransomware as you've seen with the cloud

544
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,470
jumper case which is still very alarming

545
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,060
to us as we see more and more beaches

546
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,440
coming out as a result of that not the

547
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,480
interesting modules I want to I want to

548
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,130
cover with you - it's called essentially

549
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,420
PS fin 32 which is it's a kind of a

550
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,180
point-of-sale find their reconnaissance

551
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,680
module so whenever these guys inside

552
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,620
they're also built to realize that

553
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,080
approximately in at the end of 2018 they

554
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,989
deployed a module that also queries LDAP

555
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,270
also is meant for targeting essentially

556
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,280
Active Directory and meant to exploit in

557
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,840
that but also it doesn't steal anything

558
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,490
actually that's the key there its

559
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,540
reconnaissance so what they do they

560
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:35,550
parse for very specific machines of

561
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,159
interests that either have a point of

562
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:40,080
sale targets and I'll cover that in a

563
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,540
second and it's at that time actually

564
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,399
this module was just in time for the

565
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,440
u.s. holiday season like as in the early

566
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,360
target like which company in the u.s.

567
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,500
was breached during the before the

568
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,629
holiday season where everybody goes

569
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,430
shopping we still have not identified

570
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,410
what's the final point of sale malware

571
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,330
or how would they do but we know they're

572
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,030
they've been targeting point-of-sale

573
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,800
retails and stores of interest whenever

574
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,290
they interested it's kind of like one of

575
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,180
the latest interest they've been seen in

576
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,310
the u.s. it's also another thing for you

577
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,450
to know that like in the u.s. not every

578
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,178
business moved to the

579
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,559
AMV Europe a MasterCard and Visa and not

580
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,269
every business relies in point-to-point

581
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,178
encryption so the lots of businesses are

582
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:20,580
affected by like groups like fin 7 trig

583
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:23,220
but fin 6 because of their abilities to

584
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,750
scrape like card data from memory it's

585
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,120
been very successful everybody was doing

586
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,559
it for years but now like in the Europe

587
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,840
it's more complex because there's lots

588
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,240
of more encryption there's more card

589
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,039
standards that in you know inhibit that

590
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,590
but in the u.s. it's super super

591
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,529
relevant and because not every business

592
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,658
is we call it PCI peace payment card

593
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:44,250
industry compliant if they are it's

594
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,899
gonna be well instead of fully compliant

595
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,850
with the point-to-point encryption MV

596
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:49,110
they defeat all that primarily if it's a

597
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,389
point-of-sale malware is deployed but if

598
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,590
it or not that's a problem this is kind

599
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:54,120
of like the module meant to explore this

600
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,649
also references all the presentation

601
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,928
included references to additional like

602
00:20:55,649 --> 00:21:00,418
researchers I did or what some of the

603
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:02,970
trusted researchers I work with and this

604
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,070
is just to give an idea like what's the

605
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,840
common like typical point-of-sale retail

606
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,330
networking environments you usually

607
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,830
encounter like from the attacker side so

608
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,449
you can see different accelerations you

609
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,850
can see different networks you often

610
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:18,090
times see domain controller you can see

611
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,439
both card network environments but

612
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,908
normally actually separated from

613
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,460
additional environments so that you

614
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:25,649
might see some sort of like a bridge

615
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,299
between the two and you need to find out

616
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:28,529
how to communicate to that so and this

617
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,090
is and they also rely on Active

618
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,000
Directory and that's kind of the key

619
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,470
there is because to manage like

620
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,460
multi-tenancy

621
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,289
retailer retailer point-of-sale

622
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,480
terminals across the world with

623
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:41,610
thousands of retail shops like Home

624
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,990
Depot or Target in the u.s. it's very

625
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,580
complexed but it requires lots of

626
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,059
automation and that's where the Active

627
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,980
Directory comes in and this is just to

628
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:52,740
give you again another Ida Pro

629
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:57,000
screenshot and this is them querying for

630
00:21:52,740 --> 00:22:00,299
for example here so the use I can open

631
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,789
up a new project essentially in so the

632
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:05,100
the the windows API in kind of like deal

633
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:08,269
library they use it's called like a DSi

634
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:11,519
Active Directory services interface so a

635
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:13,590
DSi DLL contains lots of useful calls

636
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,720
you can make to actually communicate by

637
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,850
LDAP so it's with tree bug true but it

638
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,210
does so it obtains an access to

639
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,110
essentially to this LDAP query category

640
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,580
computer and

641
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,159
very specific hardcore things you can

642
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,139
find on MSDN and just recoated yourself

643
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,390
and they can look in for for exam i

644
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,350
crows my crows PRS is one of the most

645
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:36,570
popular of course terminal vendor

646
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,299
provided then you know and it so they

647
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,159
try to identify how it actually looks

648
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:43,290
you know do they have like two micros in

649
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,090
the network there's any domain controls

650
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:49,440
or any machines within the domain

651
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,330
resemble anything that looks like point

652
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,860
of sale devices but not only point of

653
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,600
sale devices they also care about the

654
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,370
specific models and the reason why they

655
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,409
care about specific models is because

656
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,209
not every model is you can dump memory

657
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,370
like for example very phone is not dump

658
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,630
a bowl because it doesn't use the the

659
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:07,559
same technique so you need to somebody

660
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:09,090
you can you need to find essentially you

661
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,220
need to find a very specific machines

662
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:14,010
that have that capabilities to dump the

663
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,530
memory and search for card data and this

664
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,480
is kind of like how again works again a

665
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,490
little bit more technical so they

666
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,620
actually use this kind of like the whole

667
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:25,740
global catalog it's another way to talk

668
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,290
to LDAP and identify for oh use sites

669
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,330
groups computers wild searches and

670
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,480
hunting through networking environments

671
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,949
for like for example queries for POS of

672
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,220
course the us machines read

673
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:41,160
I think registers cache cashiers

674
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,600
probably Elaine in the US do like we

675
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,620
call it in some some of the machines and

676
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,350
never never cannot speak all lane

677
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,580
because they are like you know we have

678
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,870
multi-layered tenant tenancy and you

679
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:54,120
know lanes and cashiers pretty much the

680
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:56,070
same store retail you H BCH not sure

681
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,639
about that one Aloha is another very

682
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:02,970
very popular point-of-sale terminal

683
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,669
micros POS in terminal as well so again

684
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,830
this is primarily how it works and on

685
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:09,390
the very technical side the copious fen

686
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,600
essential stands for point of sale

687
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:14,700
finder so again I got to directory

688
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,449
enables to find that through global

689
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,370
catalog and this is just to give you an

690
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,320
idea what's the kind of life cycle and

691
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,239
once on the TTP's actually I borrow some

692
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,280
of the one of the colleagues work well

693
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,559
screenshots I guess rather it's a bread

694
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,120
Duncan from a low traffic analysis did

695
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,740
really good stuff a good job of

696
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,959
identifying what's they follow up and

697
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,490
how the infections work for example you

698
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,330
can see here like you know as I

699
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,399
mentioned earlier

700
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,289
usually installs now trig but most

701
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:43,049
popular was sophisticated kind of like

702
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:44,309
most reliable loader so after tree

703
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,720
body's been installed you can see

704
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:47,820
there's a some traffic going on and

705
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,220
approximately three hours you saw also

706
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,899
that PowerShell Empire and that's kind

707
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,179
of like one of the key things there that

708
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:55,500
the actors once they identify machines

709
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,390
or they think they want to piggyback on

710
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,760
additional environment and seeing poke

711
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,769
around and and kind of like use the

712
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,658
interactive exploitation they would use

713
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:05,700
the PowerShell Empire and this is kind

714
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,990
of like if you work to played with

715
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,700
PowerShell Empire has a highly

716
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,950
recommended it's still kind of relevant

717
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,110
even in the age of reduced PowerShell

718
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,720
privilege is still really relevant and

719
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:19,979
you can see that that's a typical HTTP

720
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,510
POST request on port 443 HTTPS SSL or

721
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,220
you would identify that essentially it's

722
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,408
a default path so they would be they

723
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,299
would they get inside and asked the bots

724
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:29,610
to execute and download and install

725
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:31,679
partial Empire and that's kind of like

726
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:34,279
the trick of there was the sit quietly

727
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,630
until they're interested in you and

728
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,460
that's how the traffic looks like from

729
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,740
from at least from their side whenever

730
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,269
you get infected and you can be infected

731
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,399
in variety of ways through usually

732
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:47,190
through more word microsoft word

733
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:50,100
malicious macro PowerShell installs and

734
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,200
trick but actually imitate trick but and

735
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:57,360
then power slam pyre and then ryuk

736
00:25:52,200 --> 00:26:00,419
ransomware whenever they interested this

737
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,529
is kind of like what like how the data

738
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,260
looks like this is actually from the

739
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:06,779
active case of ryuk ransomware when

740
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,490
essentially whenever they got inside by

741
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:10,110
u k-- they run all the scripts I showed

742
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,909
you early and network domains and active

743
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,559
directory parson they pull all the

744
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:16,350
records I have skated of course the

745
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,960
victim entity here but once this data

746
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,928
has been collected domains they look for

747
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,760
list of domains into in the local local

748
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,039
domain and that's where then if that's

749
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,419
how to identify high-value targets so

750
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,690
they so there's a big company that got

751
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,130
inside the ran this DLL modules you got

752
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,899
in then they piggybacked through

753
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,909
powerful Empire State a little bit

754
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:37,139
quieter try to dump everything they had

755
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:39,690
in a network environment essentially

756
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:41,428
from car data to sensitive financial

757
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,039
documents and then they deployed ryuk

758
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:46,289
but only in the end as their like as one

759
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:48,120
of the most like profitable ventures for

760
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:49,860
them and actually to even give you an

761
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,250
idea in most of the cases where I've

762
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,780
seen

763
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,490
I would say 80% of the cases where you

764
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,770
people and companies usually pay

765
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,390
criminals because there's no way for you

766
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,400
to again to keep the data I know there's

767
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,470
a law enforcement vise where we say no

768
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,440
you never pay extortionist but in many

769
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,210
cases when they also hit lots of

770
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,590
companies with high availability needs

771
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,450
for example hospital networks or

772
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,379
additional like you know vital

773
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,210
environments so they need availability

774
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,890
now not tomorrow so they usually

775
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,980
actually comply with the actors and pay

776
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,600
and Ryuga asks like between fifty

777
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,299
thousand dollars in bitcoins and they

778
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,250
would provide decrypter to I mentioned

779
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:27,539
earlier like it's a five billion use

780
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,780
dollars they asked once they've been

781
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:33,299
inside essentially the the cloud jumper

782
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,580
Network and they still do that actually

783
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:40,230
through because of the it's kind of trig

784
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,730
but in the cloud and this is this is

785
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,679
kind of like whenever you got kind of

786
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,400
like really affected and this is kind of

787
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,679
a last resort

788
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,510
so whenever the victims see just right

789
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,549
you could remember it's never just right

790
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,658
u k-- we're the only reason why they see

791
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:53,460
right you because probably all the

792
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,230
systems either been destroyed all the

793
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,659
logs been cleared and there's nothing

794
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:00,750
else to left behind as they say no

795
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:03,480
system is safe and they sign ryuk one

796
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,789
interesting things that i like like

797
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,580
about their email actually note they

798
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:11,760
also add at the end to confirm our

799
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,370
honest intentions will provide you free

800
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,669
file Decrypter it's very smart actually

801
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,959
and and if you ever see this in your

802
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:21,179
network environment and you can see port

803
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,940
on mail to tanoda emails to communicate

804
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,720
that means it's probably ryuk and

805
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,280
usually the way it works

806
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,080
there's no a back-end server you just

807
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,059
have to email the actors directly and

808
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,889
negotiate and actually very responsible

809
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,750
they actually reply to very quickly

810
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,520
they're very engaged the they want to

811
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,159
work with you sound like show there i've

812
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,600
seen like three types of ryuk actors

813
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,250
once that really want to kind of like

814
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,418
negotiate with you will in turn ago

815
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:45,289
there's another group they work with

816
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:47,520
were like very strict about their

817
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:49,500
request so they were asked like for

818
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,929
ridiculous money and just like say no we

819
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,549
just want like 500k in bitcoins tomorrow

820
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,799
and there's not a group that just

821
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:57,510
actually another another group but has a

822
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,240
different TTP's but they're also kind of

823
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,740
willing to negotiate as well and so so

824
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,179
there are three groups of people can you

825
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,720
can you can you can talk over those

826
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:06,570
emails

827
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,940
one is good one is bad one is also kind

828
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,710
of okay I'm gonna say I'm a same good I

829
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,720
mean in a way that they cooperate and be

830
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,340
more reasonable because it's really hard

831
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:20,610
to get five hundred thousand bitcoins in

832
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:23,399
one day so I want to also cover some of

833
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,809
the mitigation techniques detection and

834
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,520
what be recovering and talking about

835
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:28,770
what some of the most like relevant

836
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,330
cases we've seen what's the Active

837
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,539
Directory and how successful it is for

838
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,770
trig but ryuk emote ed so whenever you

839
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:37,830
go back to your networking I'm asked

840
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,780
like who has active domain right to

841
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,120
forest domains everything I'll ask those

842
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,500
people like do you are you in charge of

843
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,600
that thing that we've used in our

844
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,159
organization yes you are okay but then

845
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,389
if I who can who else can login to the

846
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,400
same at work environments that use the

847
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,760
same information because that's how they

848
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,110
trick but was doing to and identify that

849
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,470
and then there's another thing I

850
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:00,479
mentioned earlier domain DLL has XML

851
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:02,700
parser for files like scheduled tasks

852
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,940
and with passwords asked for them and

853
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,380
actually there's not an idea I took from

854
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,929
accredited to be on that call from 80

855
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,150
security so he also said that plays you

856
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:13,409
can place a new XML file into this see

857
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,520
small directory which is well I

858
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:17,460
mentioned early it's one of the most

859
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,309
config folders within your Active

860
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,809
Directory and said everyone deny because

861
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:23,158
nobody needs to read what's in your data

862
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:25,080
in your active domain there's no need

863
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:28,169
for any employee or anyone else unless

864
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,399
it's a one maybe one admin needs to do

865
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:31,350
that in plaster it should be like lots

866
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,900
of audits wanna key things you've seen

867
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,879
whenever you track like if tree but got

868
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,159
inside your active directory you can

869
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,320
audit for access denied errors for those

870
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,900
specific files once you have the XML

871
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,820
files and another thing is I mentioned

872
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,870
earlier that trick but searches for

873
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:51,270
specific point-of-sale terminals abused

874
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:53,668
admins in location GPS global policies

875
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,049
and look for permissions

876
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:56,490
let's see let's see if you can grab

877
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,230
whatever they can grab and see how

878
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,730
successful they can be but in general

879
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,679
like have a good like interview with a

880
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,510
person or in charge of the program and

881
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,100
ask them hey do you do you know who runs

882
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,309
this our Active Directory can you just

883
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,959
tell them to either reduce privileges or

884
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:11,668
mitigate that other things you can also

885
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,070
see for account a group of numeration

886
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,990
there's specific event ID logs you can

887
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,159
look for Windows logs just to see if

888
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,840
there's anything related to

889
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,910
and usually those are very gonna be very

890
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,350
high fidelity alerts because nobody

891
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,850
needs to read into that unless it's

892
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:26,370
domain and somebody tries to own

893
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,350
complete your network environment so

894
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,419
then there's some credits also kind of

895
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:33,090
linked into the github page as well from

896
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,980
Ramon to Fozzie and Shaun who actually

897
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,800
have excellent advices and what else you

898
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,780
can do from the enterprise side or from

899
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,240
Bank side or anyone else who manages

900
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,440
like Active Directory and also like you

901
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,970
know whenever you delegate this

902
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,160
management to additional third party ask

903
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,780
them the same exact questions because

904
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,000
whenever you do that remember it's not

905
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,620
your network anymore but you still going

906
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,880
to be responsible for a lot of all the

907
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,439
losses stemming from this and

908
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,090
reputational damage and of course and

909
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,250
other things so keep that in mind

910
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:05,209
so some of the key takeaways and want

911
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:07,500
you to walk away with the current

912
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,210
sophisticated a crime landscape is

913
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,360
becoming more sophisticated but it also

914
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,770
becoming more like interactive in a way

915
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,080
that it's a combination of both

916
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,879
automation or they have malware the

917
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,399
deploys and collects everything imagine

918
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,470
a motet so the scale and volume of the

919
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,570
operation is ridiculous and the deploy

920
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,220
everything is rigged bot - so when they

921
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,439
collect so much data and now they've

922
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,180
seen that to really monetize their data

923
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,950
it's not enough to do fully automation

924
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,630
and it's not enough to squeeze all the

925
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,040
value from their BOTS we need to

926
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,320
essentially have a human network

927
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,300
exploitation expert to get inside the

928
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,629
network environment and install

929
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,700
additional tools ad find the Active

930
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,290
Directory look for you know still

931
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,320
ransomware for example because it

932
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,780
enables them to be even more successful

933
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,189
and the way to identify like I've been

934
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,379
asked quite a bit like how does trigger

935
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,970
but identifies what's the target of

936
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,610
interest for them from the financial

937
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:01,980
side or or is it useless or it's just

938
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,229
something of interest to things Active

939
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,580
Directory network enumeration to

940
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,740
specific modules actually there's three

941
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,960
I covered earlier but three things then

942
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,150
able them to identify what are the most

943
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,130
protected and most like sensitive data

944
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,950
sets they can get inside and then if I

945
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:18,360
like is it worth for them to go deeper

946
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,520
into the orange is gonna be a waste of

947
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,080
time is the researcher machine I'm just

948
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,200
infecting and just wasting my time or

949
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,610
it's a high-value target so I don't

950
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,410
wanna waste their time trust me because

951
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,780
they have huge bills and their server

952
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:33,810
infrastructure and they they need cash

953
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:37,440
preferably in Russian rubles but if it's

954
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:39,780
not attainable bitcoins so another thing

955
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,900
is we've seen is the cloud MSPs the

956
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,730
cloud managed service providers are kind

957
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,260
of the desired target because their

958
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,460
gateways to other corporate environments

959
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,020
whenever you think about the attackers

960
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,660
the way they see the world they're also

961
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,400
see victims as potential gateways to

962
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,380
additional networks that's where the use

963
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,170
case of cloud jumper this is actually

964
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:01,380
the actual cloud jumper from I think

965
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:04,290
it's it's kind of the dragon how to draw

966
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,270
actually how to train your dragon they

967
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:08,570
could do cartoon and I think that's

968
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:11,159
where they got into that cloud jumper

969
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,899
not not a mistake with cloud hopper

970
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,360
because that's a whole Chinese apt group

971
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,560
that I'm not covering that so in this

972
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,730
node also I want to just to provide like

973
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,469
a few special credits with the

974
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,418
researcher square work a lot with Joshua

975
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:23,879
Platt and Jason Reeves who collaborate

976
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:26,790
in a few points and at this time I want

977
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,620
to thank you for attending feel free to

978
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,899
reach out to me on Twitter or elsewhere

979
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,460
and thank you for organizers and I'll

980
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:35,549
take a pause and take a few questions if

981
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:38,849
you guys might have thank you

982
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,849
[Applause]
