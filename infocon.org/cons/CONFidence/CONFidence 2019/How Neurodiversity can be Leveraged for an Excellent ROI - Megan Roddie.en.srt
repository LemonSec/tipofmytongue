1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,170
well first off thanks to confidence for

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,150
having speak I really appreciate the

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,039
opportunity and I'm looking forward to

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,410
share to you guys I've given some talks

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,000
on similar to common topics before but

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,600
this will be my first time giving kind

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,550
of this inner iteration of the topic of

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,910
neurodiversity hiring in different

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,850
companies so to begin a little bit about

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:35,649
me I'm a cyber threat researcher with

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:38,409
IBM's x-force iris I am also the CFO of

12
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:42,039
mental health hackers advocating for

13
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:46,510
mental health issue awareness in the

14
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:48,249
security industry and running events to

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,870
help kind of bring awareness to that and

16
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:52,120
support individuals struggling with

17
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,010
mental health issues we are looking for

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,620
sponsors so if that's something you want

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,780
to talk about please let me know and

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,989
then the reason I'm giving this talking

21
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,449
kind of the key qualification I I have

22
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:07,179
if you want to look at it that way is I

23
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:10,390
am an autistic security individual

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:13,180
working in the industry to start off I

25
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:16,390
want to give some disclaimer zhh first I

26
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:20,710
I don't have any formal background in

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:23,920
psychology or any subject medical

28
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,929
training in this area so I'm not

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,050
claiming I do I have read a lot of books

30
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,050
and articles but in terms of real

31
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:34,660
expertise I don't exactly have that yet

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:39,789
I have future plans but for the time

33
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:45,690
being please know that my my talk is not

34
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:48,220
a medically certified presentation but

35
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,530
because of work I've done through mental

36
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,660
health hackers and giving my talks again

37
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,490
although I'm not a therapist I do have a

38
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,619
lot of people who message me so I have

39
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,720
had the exposure to a wide variety of

40
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,030
issues that individuals are facing in

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,120
the industry which kind of gives me a

42
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,909
unique background on this and lastly as

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,550
I said in my about me I am an autistic

44
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,530
individual so a lot of this is personal

45
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,080
experience I'm not really sure how I

46
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,560
ended up in Poland speaking in front of

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,410
50 people about this topic but I did so

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,790
clearly something is going right for me

49
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,000
so start off let's talk about a high

50
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,040
overview of neurodiversity

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,320
essentially the concept the way IBM

52
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,650
their kind of catchphrase is to treasure

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,959
wild bucks so individuals who think

54
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,480
differently in this talk I'm going to be

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,270
focusing on autism ADHD and bipolar

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,160
disorder specifically but really at a

57
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,560
high level the concepts and the key

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,400
themes in here are going to apply to any

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,230
individuals schizophrenic individuals

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,260
individuals facing anxiety disorders

61
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,179
depression those kinds of things so so

62
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,340
the key theme applies as neurodiversity

63
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,340
which is why I gave the title itself

64
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,720
another disclaimer again neurodiversity

65
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:12,170
just like any other diversity within the

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,930
subset of individuals facing different

67
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,570
conditions autism bipolar disorder etc I

68
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:22,010
cannot give a presentation that fully

69
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:25,790
classifies all those situations or the

70
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,679
key phrases kind of saying as people say

71
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,750
is once you've met an autistic person

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,100
you've met one autistic person you

73
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,769
haven't met opening out to every

74
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,630
autistic person so I will talk about

75
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:38,150
like different traits and different

76
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,500
roles that will be well-suited but I'm

77
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,450
not saying that every individual

78
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,670
interested in security has to fall into

79
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,649
those roles or will match those specific

80
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,540
traits one thing I found interesting

81
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:52,040
when I was looking at kind of the

82
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:54,679
diversity within these subgroups is a

83
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,840
tweet that came out from an autism

84
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,310
advocate she kind of asked autistic

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,760
people like you know there's a lot of

86
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,560
stereotypes which which to unify and so

87
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,190
someone said yeah I can't do math I hate

88
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,989
math

89
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,570
stop saying autistic people are good at

90
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,100
math another person was like eye contact

91
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,769
it's great I love looking at people in

92
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,540
the eyes and then shortly after she said

93
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,519
okay there's stereotypes but some

94
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,829
stereotypes are fitting so which

95
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,530
stereotypes do you follow along the

96
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,560
lines with and there you go I'm good at

97
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,900
math and I'm terrible at eye contact so

98
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,030
just because some stereotypes are true

99
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,479
and will apply to some individuals and

100
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,128
are actual psychological traits involved

101
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,899
I

102
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:40,389
contact there is many autistic people a

103
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,519
psychological incapability to establish

104
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,969
eye contact but it doesn't mean every

105
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,649
autistic individual can't so the same

106
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:49,569
things with everything I say

107
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:53,469
know that there's plenty of individuals

108
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:55,559
who don't fit those keys so keep that in

109
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:55,558
mind

110
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:02,979
so why at a high level should you be

111
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:05,339
considering neuro diversity initiatives

112
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,779
looking at individuals for your team

113
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:09,809
first you're gonna have a wider spectrum

114
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:13,749
of capabilities by hiring only

115
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:17,800
neurotypical individuals you have a huge

116
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:20,110
area of thinking why various thinking

117
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,800
patterns that you're not gonna get from

118
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,199
a neurotypical individual one analogy is

119
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,629
sports and I used to try and like list

120
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,579
different positions in American football

121
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:33,939
but then I realized I know nothing about

122
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:37,509
sports and so that kind of failed but

123
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:40,360
the general concept is you don't you

124
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:42,039
could have the the best goalies in the

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,740
world but if you put all the best

126
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,990
girlies on the same team you're not

127
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,229
gonna have the best soccer football team

128
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,240
in the world because sports they require

129
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,919
a wide diversity of skills you want

130
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,749
people who are fast you want people are

131
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,179
strong you want people are good kickers

132
00:05:55,749 --> 00:06:00,729
who are good goalies building a team

133
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:03,698
based on one really good skill set is

134
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:06,188
gonna make you good at that one that

135
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,679
single thing but when you come up

136
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:11,559
against teams with a wide diversity of

137
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:14,818
backgrounds of thinking patterns you're

138
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:18,929
gonna be more capable in the long run

139
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:21,789
second by supporting individuals with

140
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:23,649
disorders as they're likely already some

141
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:26,860
in your organization that you may not

142
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:28,899
even know about creating an environment

143
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,550
in which they feel comfortable and are

144
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,719
happier they're going to be more

145
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,099
passionate they're going to produce

146
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:38,379
better work you're gonna have a longer

147
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,419
term employees staying there because

148
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:42,059
they feel that their environment is

149
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,789
supportive

150
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:46,990
however happier employees isn't really a

151
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:48,690
level talk when you

152
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,220
tell them you want to hire some people

153
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,190
create hiring initiatives focused on

154
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,410
neurodiversity a CEO isn't gonna think

155
00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:00,910
happier employees depending on the

156
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:03,610
situation is worth the costs so what's

157
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:07,600
the sea level speak of this first reduce

158
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,880
staff turnover so a statistic related to

159
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,210
this is that direct replacements cost

160
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,219
for a role can reach as high as 50 to 60

161
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,190
percent of an employee's annual salary

162
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,250
and as the total associated costs such

163
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,370
as retraining up that new employee and

164
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:27,540
all the different equipment recycling

165
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,520
and all that you can reach up to 290

166
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,970
percent to 200 percent of an annual

167
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,590
salary just to get a new employee and

168
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,750
which obviously that's a lot of money

169
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,760
being spent especially in the

170
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,830
cybersecurity industry we have a very

171
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,980
high turnover rate due to the demand

172
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,609
when you there is always someone willing

173
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:53,170
to pay you more to go to their company

174
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:56,830
and 33 percent of companies it's found

175
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:59,200
that employers believe that employees

176
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,770
with disabilities if the environment is

177
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,810
cater really works with them they're

178
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,789
less likely to leave just because it is

179
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,320
more difficult for a neurodiverse

180
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,680
employee to find an environment they

181
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,530
thrive in so there's a lot less of a

182
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,440
chance of employee turnover which in

183
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,729
turn equals cost which you know the CFO

184
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,820
and CEO are interesting keeping down

185
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:28,120
second is consumer appeal for example

186
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,730
the number of people number of children

187
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,500
diagnosed with autism plus their direct

188
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,500
relatives such as their parents

189
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,039
grandparents and cousins counting that

190
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,070
out in the US alone is about 55 million

191
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,140
people meaning 17 percent of the US

192
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,870
population in some way has a

193
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,689
relationship to an autistic individual

194
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,990
was found that consumers are more likely

195
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:56,440
to switch to a company a different brand

196
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,720
or a different provider if they have

197
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,670
show outward support for a cause that

198
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,520
they related that they

199
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,979
feel connected to so that's 17 percent

200
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,720
of the US population who if they look at

201
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,880
a company that's saying we support

202
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,970
autistic individuals we want to help

203
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,439
them you know Aaron autistic employees

204
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,480
are speaking out saying they're happy

205
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,910
there's a good chance that you'll have

206
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,400
consumers who are looking to switch to

207
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,439
your company partially based on the fact

208
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,800
that they know you're supportive of a

209
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,520
cause that's close to them and

210
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,280
regulatory compliance this one I kind of

211
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:36,100
if he putting in because it is kind of a

212
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,380
controversial thing and somewhat and I

213
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,570
guess it may be less applicable to

214
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,660
Poland as I don't know you're you're

215
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:46,090
hiring laws but in the u.s. at least a

216
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,400
lot of fiber security companies probably

217
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,500
most of them have a contract with the

218
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,720
federal government for services or

219
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,330
products or whatever they may need and

220
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,970
if you work with the federal government

221
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:02,820
or any government agencies they require

222
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:06,400
a certain percentage of your staff be

223
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,200
disabled in some way including what are

224
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,980
considered neurological disabilities

225
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,740
autism bipolar depression so whether a

226
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,840
good reason or not if you really need to

227
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,610
pull strings with the c-level tell them

228
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:25,690
that those autistic ploys you're going

229
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:28,330
in are meeting a quota so one thing I

230
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,790
really try to hit on in these talks and

231
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,550
when I'm talking with both neurodiverse

232
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,920
individuals and managers is it's a

233
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,160
give-and-take relationship in the power

234
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,130
of neurodiversity by Thomas Armstrong he

235
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,170
talks about some key principles

236
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,000
associated with neurodiversity and one

237
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,219
of the first ones principle number five

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,340
I believe is that success in life is

239
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,670
based on adapting one's brains to the

240
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,530
needs of the surrounding environment I

241
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,020
as an autistic individual live in a

242
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,360
world designed for neurotypicals and

243
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,990
thus I have to adjust some of the ways

244
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,160
that I live day to day

245
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:12,280
in order to adapt to the normal world

246
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,449
but as I said my key point it's a

247
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,540
give-and-take

248
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:19,060
part of success in life is also based on

249
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,490
modifying my surrounding environment to

250
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,619
fit the needs of my innate brain this is

251
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,180
called Nate niche construction which

252
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,360
I'll kind of mention that term again

253
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:31,469
later but basically though I can do

254
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,970
certain things to to meet the

255
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,790
environment that I live in and learn to

256
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:40,270
live in that environment my success is

257
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:42,910
also partially rely like that I need to

258
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:48,850
be in an in an environment that's suited

259
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:50,890
well for me too so I'm guest start off

260
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,050
kind of focusing on autism spectrum

261
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,569
disorders this is probably obviously

262
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,680
when I'm closest to on the one that most

263
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:02,290
healthy comes from personal experience

264
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,329
so so the challenges I and other

265
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,329
autistic individuals may face our

266
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:11,260
communication whether that be

267
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:13,320
interpersonal communication speaking in

268
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,810
front of large groups obviously I've

269
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,400
done okay with that but interpersonal

270
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,400
communication knowing how to communicate

271
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:25,230
with coworkers and my manager is a bit

272
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:29,579
something that I more challenges with

273
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:32,680
kind of an obsessive nature not

274
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,140
necessarily always impacting the job but

275
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,020
it can impact the personality in the way

276
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,480
that interacting with an autistic

277
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,120
individual can be much different and

278
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,910
sometimes an uncomfortable experience or

279
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,540
something that is considered weird by a

280
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:53,260
neurotypical individual who is is seeing

281
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,780
the obsessive behavior you know someone

282
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,550
who you've probably encountered as most

283
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,589
of us have probably encountered autistic

284
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,479
individuals and it's that person who

285
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,310
wants to talk about trains for half an

286
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,470
hour no matter how hard you try to

287
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,329
change the subjects it just won't work

288
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,820
and eventually you're in a situation

289
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,250
where you're like how do I get out of

290
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,410
this and so that that kind of thing

291
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:17,440
though it doesn't impact the ability to

292
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,209
do the job once you get in a situation

293
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,690
like that you're less likely to want to

294
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:24,310
hire or work with such an individual

295
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,990
lastly weak executive functioning and

296
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,180
there's some areas of plan

297
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,060
and how work is completed and the

298
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,489
understanding of how to perform work and

299
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:39,709
business functions there's some

300
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:42,140
struggles in those areas however saw the

301
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:44,779
strengths and extreme attention to

302
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,779
detail autistic people see things on a

303
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:50,180
more granular level than neurotypical

304
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:53,290
people which of course can be a great

305
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:57,020
strength for security professionals

306
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:59,240
expanding further to IT an example is

307
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,920
Quality Assurance testers you'll find a

308
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,550
lot of autistic people in those roles

309
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:07,339
and that a lot of companies with autism

310
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,949
hiring initiatives are hiring for

311
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,440
quality assurance testers because we're

312
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,680
the kind of people who can pick at every

313
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,080
little issue and find all the problems

314
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,760
which can be annoying in a general sense

315
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,330
where that's not an important part of

316
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,560
your job which is why roles where you

317
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,380
know it's a good thing when you're

318
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,290
pointing out the tiniest of mistakes is

319
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,079
is a strength and lastly high

320
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,300
productivity one of my strengths is I

321
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:38,529
can probably do three to four times the

322
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:42,319
amount of work that a co-worker can do

323
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:44,089
I'm not sure why but it's something I've

324
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,370
found in multiple jobs and that I've

325
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,540
heard from other employers of autistic

326
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:53,420
individuals it's just how my brain works

327
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:55,430
I'm able to do more work so you're

328
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,349
getting you know four times the value

329
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,149
when you're paying me you're paying me

330
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:04,670
the same as another employee but you're

331
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:07,940
getting four times the value so or so so

332
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,160
nish construction like some things again

333
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:13,089
this is definitely not an inclusive list

334
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,730
but again I give the little things that

335
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:18,980
don't hurt an employer in any way but

336
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:22,790
are often overlooked to some things that

337
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:25,550
can be super important modulation of

338
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:29,120
sensory input one of the big aspects of

339
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:31,760
autism is hypersensitivity whether it be

340
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,860
two textures sounds taste that kind of

341
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:39,500
thing for me I have a severe version to

342
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,449
certain textures of food which doesn't

343
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,359
really affect my work

344
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:45,248
stuff but it is something where this

345
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,919
kind of makes me weird I seem like a

346
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:51,279
picky three-year-old when I'm eating but

347
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,529
I just have a lot of concerns like for

348
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,439
example work thing is I'm very very

349
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:59,319
particular about what I wear I struggle

350
00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:03,009
to do my job if I'm not comfortable and

351
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:05,889
so finding roles where I can wear what I

352
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:07,809
want you know obviously appropriate

353
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,669
clothes but I can wear jeans and a

354
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:12,009
t-shirt and not have to dress up in a

355
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:14,439
blouse and dress pants and stuff like

356
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:16,359
that that was something I literally

357
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:18,519
considered when I was job hunting is

358
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:20,769
what do I have to wear for work and I it

359
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,609
was negative points if I had to dress in

360
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:27,970
business attire and then stimming this

361
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:31,389
is again something you may see kind of a

362
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,249
stereotype of the flapping hands for me

363
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,739
it's when I'm sitting down typically I

364
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:37,809
cannot stop shaking my left leg and

365
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:41,199
depending on the situation and my

366
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:44,499
emotions or my my energy level it may be

367
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,868
pretty like noticeable but in the end

368
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:48,819
like does it really affect you if

369
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:53,470
somebody's moving a body limb a little

370
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:55,179
bit so not not creating a judgemental

371
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,739
environment or pointing that out and

372
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,929
just accepting that it's something the

373
00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:02,369
person does can make more of a

374
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:02,369
difference than you think so

375
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:07,919
some negative job laments some jobs that

376
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:11,319
individuals may struggle with

377
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,610
multitasking something where the person

378
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,589
is working on one thing and then you

379
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,839
want them to switch to something on no

380
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,240
notice or like here do this and this and

381
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,819
this and this all at the same time by

382
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,579
the end of the day high level of

383
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:27,250
socialization again I've met autistic

384
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,908
people who love like being I know some

385
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,330
people autistic IBM errs who are in HR

386
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:34,269
roles

387
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,220
or who travel to customer sites but

388
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:38,740
there's a lot of us who would prefer to

389
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,440
work in an office alone and you know I

390
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,289
like having a team but I don't like

391
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,870
having to go out to other teams or

392
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:49,419
having to work with customers so I fit

393
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:52,658
well in a role where I just have my team

394
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:53,830
to talk to and there's other liaisons to

395
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:57,220
deal with manager

396
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:59,260
other teams lastly tied to the nish

397
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,019
construction rolls with a century

398
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:09,809
overload are probably going to be more

399
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:12,549
difficult roles to handle okay a

400
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:14,590
positive job elephants roles we're

401
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:17,379
autistic individuals are gonna tend to

402
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:21,309
exceed our ones with routine repetitive

403
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,929
tasks and logic so we we like to know

404
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,658
what we're doing what's going on

405
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:27,549
so roles such as incident response are a

406
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:30,100
bit more difficult I love doing digital

407
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:32,500
forensics and incident response but I

408
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,629
admit that the but not knowing what's

409
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,880
going on or like last minute like hey

410
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,130
you got do this now that's a bit more of

411
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,710
a challenge whereas a routine in a role

412
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,840
I am now with threat Intel where I have

413
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:47,010
a task and I'm working on that task and

414
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,760
is kind of procedural I like that

415
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:54,460
repetitive tasks so again less security

416
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,010
specific but an example that people

417
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,679
understand like data entry that's

418
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,500
something that there's a strengthened

419
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,419
and even better about that is that's

420
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,529
typically the roles that most nerves

421
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:09,940
typicals hate the mundane repetitive

422
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:12,870
tasks which those are the ones that I

423
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,850
love so my current role there's a lot of

424
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:19,330
Intel data entry into our database and a

425
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:22,029
lot of like cataloguing of data and a

426
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:25,418
lot of like fixing of you know human

427
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:27,399
error type things and nobody loves doing

428
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:29,320
that but I love data entry and

429
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,820
categorization and so I'm the one who

430
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,980
will spend hours sorting through the

431
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,260
database looking for any typos and

432
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,799
fixing those and going through all the

433
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,809
data and tagging it so that that gives

434
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,210
me a strength and I like it

435
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:44,250
others like not doing it and so it works

436
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,039
out for everyone

437
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:51,490
and again logical tasks tasks where I

438
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:54,370
can I can figure out problems and follow

439
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:57,309
a path of logic again there's creative

440
00:19:54,370 --> 00:20:00,070
autistic people who who aren't as strong

441
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:03,809
in the logic areas but the one of the

442
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,809
common thinking patterns is logical

443
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,030
so what are some example draw barrels

444
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,709
matching this obviously I'm in a threat

445
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,710
research role and I find that's very

446
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:16,470
suitable typically it's a set schedule

447
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:18,150
you know of a specific time I'm not

448
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,420
being called at 2:00 in the morning for

449
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:23,490
an incident I'm looking through data on

450
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,070
processing data I'm understanding a

451
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,890
logical path throughout hunting again

452
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,320
that attention to detail really comes in

453
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:34,020
with threat hunting part that being able

454
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,260
to sit through millions of logs to

455
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:40,170
identify a specific activity the

456
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,390
pivoting I love the logic of I have a IP

457
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,910
or hash and I want to find related

458
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,830
indicators I want to find malicious

459
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,890
activity on a network based on that

460
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,230
stuff so the hunting roll and then

461
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,840
vulnerability analysis I've done a bit

462
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,570
of this and it's not really my cup of

463
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,610
tea but the part site there were parts I

464
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,669
did like about it just having these

465
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:04,560
reports raw data and having to sift

466
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:07,320
through it and find ok what's actually

467
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,030
relevant to my company what do these

468
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:15,210
vulnerabilities mean how should I

469
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:18,149
prioritize that kind of thing so moving

470
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,850
on to bipolar disorder I worked with a

471
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:24,480
bipolar security analyst on this section

472
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:27,750
which I'll mention later who is and so I

473
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,660
I've kind of got both some research in

474
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:33,090
books and his opinion so some challenges

475
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,190
faced obviously the key characteristic

476
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,459
of bipolar disorder is the mood swings

477
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:41,970
the ups and downs euphoria depression

478
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,580
rage typically not great for a work job

479
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:47,520
that you just decide one day you don't

480
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,990
feel like working or you you know you

481
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,820
come in angry and you don't want to deal

482
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:55,650
with people when your job deals with

483
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:57,689
people so a second aspects typically

484
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,830
less with bipolar in general but more

485
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:04,650
Soccio a schizo affective disorder is

486
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:06,600
psychosis I've the bipolar and

487
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,910
schizoaffective individuals I've talked

488
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,439
to said that really becomes a problem at

489
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,120
work when they're in their space no one

490
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,340
understands what they're going through

491
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,159
and you know they can't focus on work

492
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,080
with the psychosis kick in and

493
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,140
kind of related to the psychosis the

494
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,780
distracted thoughts especially during

495
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,680
the major mood swings all those thoughts

496
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:32,340
you're having distracting from the work

497
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:34,320
the strengths though there's pretty

498
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,949
strong empathy and individuals with

499
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,379
bipolar disorder energy during manic

500
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,170
states during a manic state a bipolar

501
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,200
individual gets that that passion that

502
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:48,120
high productivity that kind of other

503
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,900
things similar to what I talked about in

504
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,290
autism and creativity so there there is

505
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:59,910
that creative spin that not all logical

506
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,750
security people have so nish

507
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,940
construction

508
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,620
bipolar individuals are going to be well

509
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,690
suited in an environment where they feel

510
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:10,110
that meaning purpose they have a goal

511
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:12,030
that they have to focus on hands-on

512
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,610
environments where they get to work with

513
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,220
their hands and also being able to work

514
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:19,709
for oneself as opposed to being in a

515
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:24,290
more traditional environment working for

516
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:27,980
an employer so so the example job roles

517
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:30,000
cybersecurity analysts is a good role

518
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,220
penetration testing and social

519
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,530
engineering where the key ones though I

520
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,600
kind of talk through with some bipolar

521
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:42,149
individuals is kind of that empathy and

522
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,929
the also the the nature of kind of

523
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:49,020
penetration and social engineering like

524
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:51,060
jobs people too a bit more flexible of a

525
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,790
schedule and being able to work in that

526
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:57,030
period of mania and and work through

527
00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:02,399
that so that's that's those are good

528
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:05,399
roles for those individuals last key

529
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,910
category is the attention deficit

530
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,010
hyperactivity disorder so this is

531
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:13,410
definitely very common I'm sure everyone

532
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,270
in this room knows someone who has been

533
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,330
diagnosed with ADHD if you haven't

534
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:20,940
yourself and it's very common in the

535
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,830
security industry mental health hackers

536
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,740
we had someone come forward needing help

537
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:29,399
and we posted on Twitter hey can we get

538
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,650
some feedback and dozens and dozens and

539
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,400
dozens of tweets

540
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:39,050
from ADHD security people talking about

541
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,760
their experiences so so the main

542
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,580
challenges are weak executive

543
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,540
functioning as with autism again that's

544
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,100
things like planning prioritization

545
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:52,070
scheduling things that are kind of

546
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,830
business centric skills that are

547
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,290
typically important job role are more

548
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,970
challenging for individuals then

549
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:02,540
hyperactivity being one of the key

550
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,900
aspects of ADHD kind of not wanting to

551
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,580
sit still in an office all day and

552
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,780
struggling in certain areas of that

553
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,879
focus maintaining focus strengths

554
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:17,389
actually include hyper focus which seems

555
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,420
contradictory to the fact kind of both

556
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:23,060
the stigmas and and those kinds of

557
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:26,390
things that most people assume it's

558
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:29,179
super distracted they actually ADHD

559
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:32,450
people are able to hyper focus on

560
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,340
certain things it just isn't always the

561
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:37,310
thing they should be hyper focusing on

562
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,889
but in a state where they are focused

563
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:43,280
and interested on a task it's an extreme

564
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:47,150
level producing high productivity and

565
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,340
great work and then hyperactivity again

566
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,350
though it was on the challenges slide

567
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,080
it's kind of also strength in the way

568
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:57,230
that in the right job role that

569
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,439
hyperactivity can be channeled in a way

570
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:03,350
that produces high quality work a lot of

571
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:10,010
work high productivity and stuff like

572
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:12,350
that niche construction the kind of

573
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:15,320
environments that these individuals will

574
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:19,189
thrive most in in most cases a role with

575
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,830
physical movement being able to use that

576
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,080
energy in a physical way as opposed to

577
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:27,560
sitting in a cubicle for eight hours a

578
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,600
day an environment would change where

579
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,210
you know whether it be TAS change

580
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,120
location change role change that kind of

581
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,190
thing being able to swap back and forth

582
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,860
high stimulation environment similar to

583
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:42,720
the energy being able to channel that

584
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:46,290
hyperactivity into an environment that

585
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,750
acceptable and hands-on activity is

586
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:51,870
generally more interesting to such an

587
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:58,230
individual as opposed to rote routine

588
00:26:51,870 --> 00:27:00,320
activity so the job elements kind of

589
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:03,270
translated from that niche construction

590
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,939
that may be ideal for such an individual

591
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:08,280
is being able to travel or move around

592
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,620
frequently whether that means being able

593
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,740
to travel to different states countries

594
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,409
cities for engagements or it just means

595
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,420
movie around in the buildings or in a

596
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:21,150
location to be able to channel that

597
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:24,330
hyper activity again working with one's

598
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:26,400
hands being actively involved with new

599
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:30,300
situations almost opposite to what I

600
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,430
like about the routine same day day ADHD

601
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,960
individuals prefer to be able to change

602
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,140
what they're working on and see new

603
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,910
things and try new things

604
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,280
handling emergencies you'll actually

605
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,170
find a high concentration of ADHD

606
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,860
individuals working in law enforcement

607
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:49,190
or in fire departments because that

608
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,050
environment of kind of high adrenaline

609
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:55,740
is something that that works very well

610
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,210
and working for oneself another place

611
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,060
where you'll find a high concentration

612
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:09,660
of a PhD individuals is CEOs of

613
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:12,419
companies they tend to thrive so example

614
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:16,680
job roles from the emergency perspective

615
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:18,600
and kind of correlating the love for law

616
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,060
enforcement work and fire department

617
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,070
work is Incident Response errs obviously

618
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,110
that correlations there that being able

619
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,000
to chase down a threat the adrenaline of

620
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,860
an attacker and a network figuring out

621
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,450
what happens stake of the company is on

622
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:36,090
the line is the perfect environment

623
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:38,580
hunting being able to get into a hyper

624
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,830
focused move and follow all those paths

625
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,470
to find an attacker again the adrenaline

626
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:46,370
of we know something bad is happening

627
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,900
but we've got to get the whole scope and

628
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:51,870
consulting roles specifically because of

629
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,540
that being able to travel move around

630
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,739
and then especially most consulting

631
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,080
roles here

632
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,580
security you're on an engagement doing

633
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,840
something for a few weeks but then

634
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:07,860
you're off to something else so that

635
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:10,110
that change in role so where the key

636
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,659
takeaways for all the potential people

637
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,699
in this room for the neuro-diverse in

638
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,400
the role so the lessons I've learned and

639
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,809
the things that I recommend to people

640
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,670
you got to recognize your strengths and

641
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:22,950
weaknesses I know what I'm good at

642
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,500
I know what I'm bad at and I've learned

643
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,290
to kind of articulate that to my

644
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,860
managers because I know that I can

645
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:34,139
thrive in a situation where I can

646
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,820
leverage my strengths and I know that

647
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,800
bad things are going to be happen if I

648
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:43,409
put in a situation where my weaknesses

649
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:45,030
are you come out more I learned what

650
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,170
works for me

651
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:50,820
that niche constructor that that kind of

652
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:53,070
learning to work in an environment I'm

653
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:56,250
in there's some things that I have to

654
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:59,280
learn to do differently that individuals

655
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,990
that are neurotypical may not for

656
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,740
example kind of related to my like

657
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:07,770
clothing fabric sensitivity these pairs

658
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,050
of jeans I have six pairs of them and

659
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,970
those are all my jeans because you know

660
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:14,428
I'd rather have six pairs of the same

661
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,110
jeans I don't have to think about what

662
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:19,230
pair of pants I'm wearing in the morning

663
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:21,479
I don't have to worry about trying and

664
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,860
picking out no clothes and like those

665
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:28,110
little things that are kind of weird and

666
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,879
maybe hard to you're out I found are

667
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:33,290
like the things that reduce the stress

668
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,660
in my life and help me kind of maintain

669
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:39,570
the balance and the peace and so I I

670
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:42,000
save everything I buy on Amazon so that

671
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,830
I can hit reorder if if the pair pants

672
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,250
rips I can just replace them with a new

673
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:51,149
pair quick and then self-improvement is

674
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:53,670
self-care recognizing that that you do

675
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:56,220
have a medical condition that requires

676
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:58,080
treatment and care whatever that tree

677
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,929
may be again that's finding what works

678
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,780
for you maybe you want to be on

679
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:04,830
medication maybe you don't therapy is an

680
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,740
option

681
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,030
working out exercising alone can be that

682
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,950
self-care you need

683
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,110
to feel better about yourself but

684
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:16,100
whatever is making sure that you you

685
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,929
also take into account that you are

686
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:21,600
treating a medical condition and so you

687
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:24,360
need to identify what's needed for that

688
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:30,149
and take the appropriate iemon steps to

689
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:32,100
do that as an organization if you're in

690
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,530
the c-suite or if your organization is

691
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,990
looking to you for recommendations what

692
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:40,230
can you do well first promote

693
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:43,020
neurodiversity show to potential

694
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:45,570
employees to consumers to your staff

695
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,610
that you are a company that respects

696
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:51,389
neurodiverse individuals and even

697
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:54,719
promotes that and so beginning just the

698
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:56,280
the culture of here here is the kind of

699
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,740
organization we want to portray

700
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,590
ourselves and be a kind of environment

701
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,750
we want to make look into neurodiverse

702
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,000
hiring initiatives

703
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:09,270
there's many big companies search autism

704
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,100
at work there's this kind of overlapping

705
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:15,570
organization composed of different

706
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:20,340
companies such as JPMorgan Microsoft IBM

707
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:22,290
and sa P just to name a few that all

708
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,959
have hiring programs internally

709
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:29,940
specifically focused on creating a

710
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,530
recruitment process that works for for

711
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,740
autistic and other neurodiverse

712
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:38,149
individuals since the hiring process is

713
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:40,650
another aspect they handle differently

714
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,500
there's there's programs already set up

715
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,300
for example IBM in order for us to do a

716
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,700
hiring program it's not just some people

717
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:50,790
internally we work with an organization

718
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,550
called specialist stern where basically

719
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:57,120
they are finding and working with and

720
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:59,100
training autistic individuals and then

721
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,169
hoping place them with potential

722
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,820
employers who are contracting with them

723
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:07,290
kind of like hiring a recruitment agency

724
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:09,929
but focused on autism support managers

725
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:12,030
and employees so create an organization

726
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:14,040
where if them as hey I have this

727
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,530
employee I need to make this on

728
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,360
Commendation can we make this work be

729
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:22,200
willing to work with those managers and

730
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,870
employees and lastly something not as

731
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,050
common to find

732
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:28,449
in organizations but for all employees

733
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:30,240
not just neurotypical and neurodiverse

734
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,350
but also neurotypical employees

735
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,559
investigate how you can offer mental

736
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:39,250
health benefits look into health care

737
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:41,680
plans that will help cover therapy costs

738
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,080
and stuff like that so it's not as

739
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,750
common you may get great health benefits

740
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,179
for any physical conditions but then you

741
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,740
go to get therapy for your depression

742
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,960
and all of a sudden nothing's covered

743
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,570
there so and those things can be

744
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,450
expensive so as an organization look

745
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:01,330
into the ways you can do that

746
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:04,179
another example being like mental health

747
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:06,520
PTO making sure have mental health days

748
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:10,960
that your employees are required to take

749
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,969
to take a day off and just relax and

750
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,740
make sure that you're not burning out

751
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:21,299
your staff from stepping down it's here

752
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:23,949
to the manager level the main thing for

753
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,379
managers is to accommodate and adjust

754
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:28,509
learn that the management methods you

755
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:30,580
use for your neurotypical employees are

756
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:34,120
not going to be the same ones that work

757
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:36,759
for your neurodiverse employees and

758
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,279
learn what that means it takes time it's

759
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,190
a different experience but we're looking

760
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,010
whether it will work advocate advocate

761
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,960
for your employee both among your

762
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:49,240
coworkers you know make sure that

763
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,330
they're supported by their own team make

764
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:54,609
sure that if they need anything your

765
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,830
management the managers management is

766
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,930
supportive in helping and that the

767
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,819
organization recognizes that its

768
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:04,540
managers and employees find this

769
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:06,340
important and then actually this one's

770
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,130
probably the most important is patience

771
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,930
and understanding there is going to be a

772
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:14,160
learning curve for both the manager and

773
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:16,720
the we especially for first-time

774
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,160
employees entering the workforce they've

775
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,990
never had to drop before and they

776
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,870
themselves haven't learned how to adjust

777
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:25,120
to their environment so it's important

778
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,319
to recognize that it may take some time

779
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,140
and there's definitely gonna be some

780
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,620
hiccups you may not typically experience

781
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,379
with a neurotypical employee who kind of

782
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:36,299
naturally understands the business world

783
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,730
the

784
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,800
this world and having a job is an

785
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,500
environment that was created for them

786
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,690
essentially you're gonna experience

787
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,690
challenges especially early on and so

788
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:51,480
just trying to stick through that and

789
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,400
not immediately dismiss the employee and

790
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,590
decide that it was a bad hire because

791
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,320
there are some challenges early on

792
00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:00,570
because neurodiverse individuals again

793
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,520
adapt we learn how to work with our

794
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:05,670
environment but we can't learn what we

795
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:11,370
don't know so we need a time to adjust

796
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:12,660
and we will adjust as a co-worker what

797
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,480
can you do

798
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,970
awareness just making yourself aware of

799
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,370
a situation that individuals may have be

800
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,500
in this is a good you know general

801
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:25,200
recommendation like even if you don't

802
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,940
know your co-workers or neurodiverse you

803
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,339
know keep in mind that everyone thinks

804
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,430
and works differently but especially in

805
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:35,070
a situation where you know you have a

806
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:38,069
co-worker who thinks differently and

807
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:40,710
works differently understanding that the

808
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,930
way you approach them and they approach

809
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:46,830
you will likely be different than what

810
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:49,169
you've experienced in the past one thing

811
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:53,520
always push with my new teams is to ask

812
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:55,440
questions and learn my teammates who

813
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,330
come and ask me questions all the time

814
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,020
about certain things and I'm happy to

815
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:04,040
answer I prefer you ask rather than just

816
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:06,390
accepting social stigmas and stereotypes

817
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,490
ask me and I'm not going to be offended

818
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,859
like I want you to learn like it does me

819
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:13,109
no good for you to make assumptions or

820
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,600
just be mad at me ask me a question and

821
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:17,790
maybe I'm doing something that I didn't

822
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,190
know I was doing I can learn from the

823
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,940
experience too and again patience and

824
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,130
understanding

825
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,700
I might make you mad or stress you out

826
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:29,460
or something ask questions learn point

827
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:32,839
things out but also work with me and

828
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:37,950
don't you know hate me as a co-worker

829
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:41,310
early on when I'm still learning so I

830
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:44,600
specifically wanted to shout out to a

831

forward about his stuff and he has a

835
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:56,619
blog called the bipolar hacker so you

836
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:58,538
can check him out and read his work that

837
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:00,880
he's done on this ask him questions he

838
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:03,520
was very helpful and answered a lot of

839
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,270
my questions so I really appreciate that

840
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,950
Amanda Berlin or info sister on Twitter

841
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:11,680
she's the CEO of mental health hackers

842
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:14,288
and by bringing me in and heavily

843
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:18,339
involving me with her organization I've

844
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:19,960
met a lot of people stuff and it's it's

845
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:21,880
been a great being a part of that and

846
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,940
really important me that of course my

847
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,160
manager Nick Bradley at IBM he lets me

848
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,920
travel and come and do these talks which

849
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,339
is really nice and additionally through

850
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,289
some challenges he's adjusted his

851
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:37,450
management styles when I say something's

852
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:39,730
not working for me he figures out a way

853
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,379
to make work so it's really important

854
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,240
that he gets recognition for that

855
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:49,630
because not all managers can handle a

856
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:57,459
situation to present at conferences on

857
00:38:49,630 --> 00:39:01,359
work times I forgot a conclusion slide

858
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:03,520
so that's it so thank you for letting me

859
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,740
in for coming to this talk it always

860
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,480
makes me happy to see a relatively big

861
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,009
audience and know that you know the

862
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,559
message is getting out I always say if

863
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,079
one person learned something then you

864
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,819
know my time here was worth it so did

865
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,260
anyone have any questions I can answer

866
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:25,300
like I said I like questions yeah

867
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,300
