1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:14,289
well first of all thanks for being here

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:17,470
I have the impression that this might be

3
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:19,930
one of the let's say most non-technical

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,540
talks of this whole conference so thanks

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,130
for sticking to this one I will not go

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,840
into any kind of technical details but I

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,259
want to talk about vulnerabilities and

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,330
basically about let's say how to deal

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,750
with vulnerabilities in terms of how to

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,730
maybe sell them how to make money out of

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,329
it just just to give an impression which

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,419
kind of let's say possibilities you have

13
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:45,969
and which are the actual advantages and

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,789
the drawbacks so for those of you who

15
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:51,640
want to have a deep technical let's say

16
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:53,499
session on vulnerabilities sorry there

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,589
is nothing you for here nothing in here

18
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:58,539
for you if you want to know something

19
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:01,629
about the vulnerability market and let's

20
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:03,609
say possibilities to actually extort

21
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:06,908
kind of money out of all abilities well

22
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:09,159
then you're right so first things first

23
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:12,040
my name is solution Artur I'm a security

24
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:16,110
Mentalist with Trend Micro and part of

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,910
my my role is is this kind of let's say

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,340
mixture between technical and business

27
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,470
related stuff so yes I do have a

28
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,560
technical background and I do like

29
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,440
hacking my free time but that's not part

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,520
of my official role so let's start with

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,940
with something simple let's say just

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,890
just for a minute that you discovered a

33
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:44,289
vulnerability a zero-day vulnerability

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,000
remotely exploitable in Windows I mean

35
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,310
there are a few of them but let's just

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,900
take this as an idea so you found

37
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,800
something or somebody you know found

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,110
something what's your first reaction

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,620
what's your first thing that you might

40
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:02,230
think of to do well depending on whether

41
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,930
you are wearing black gray or white hats

42
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,530
your first reaction might be well let's

43
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,840
just tell it to the vendor dear mister

44
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:15,390
vendor there is a vulnerability within

45
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:20,220
your coat good idea

46
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:23,160
just one little caveat depending on who

47
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:28,440
you're talking to this might be a pretty

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:31,620
bad idea because some vendors do not

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:35,130
like being informed about

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,020
vulnerabilities so I just picked up a

51
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,150
few examples that don't come and run I

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,040
don't want to do any any blaming here

53
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,650
it's just a random choice of a few

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,650
reactions that vendors had when they

55
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,940
were notified of a vulnerability the

56
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:53,040
first one is from PwC and basically what

57
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,090
happened is that somebody found a

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:01,350
vulnerability in their internal

59
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:03,390
applications and the reaction was well

60
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,410
nice that you found a vulnerability but

61
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,559
if you're going to release it we're

62
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:11,070
going to sue you so the first response

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,140
that they got was actually do not

64
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,900
publish the vulnerability otherwise you

65
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,920
will be in big trouble

66
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,470
reason for that one at least that's the

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,708
reason that the PWC brought up was well

68
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,510
this is an internal application that you

69
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,799
shouldn't have had access in the first

70
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:31,170
place so this has this is kind of

71
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,060
forbidden so everything that you found

72
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,059
out of that forbidden action by finding

73
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,239
this into application is illegal as well

74
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,320
so don't publish that vulnerability it's

75
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,970
quite interesting if you read the

76
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,739
article you will see that their internal

77
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,480
applications leaked to the internet so

78
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,269
they were not as internal as they

79
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,940
thought but still this was one of the

80
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,310
reactions if you're going to release it

81
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,209
we're going to sue you what even gets

82
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:01,650
better even if a vendor has a back

83
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:05,519
bounty program in some cases they only

84
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,340
want to hear backs that are covered by

85
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,250
their program this is a pretty good

86
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,590
example where somebody Welbeck bounty

87
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,890
program was for the actual film where of

88
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,459
the drones and somebody found a

89
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:24,120
vulnerability in their website and told

90
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,099
them and the reaction was well this

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,960
vulnerability is not covered by the BAC

92
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,400
bounty program again if you're going to

93
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,219
release it if you go to this close

94
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,289
you will be in big trouble and this kind

95
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,620
of repeats itself by the way this is

96
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:40,650
quite an interesting read there is a

97
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,540
pretty long paper on this one with all

98
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,969
the details explaining while the

99
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,920
researcher effectively walked away from

100
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,190
around about thirty thousand US dollars

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,190
of bounty just because he was sorry for

102
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,510
the French pissed off because the first

103
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,080
answer he got was if you're going to

104
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,640
release it we're going to sue you and

105
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,169
this is not just meta to to non IT

106
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,990
companies by the way if you are working

107
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,040
or if you're dealing with let's say non

108
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,490
IT especially non IT security companies

109
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,620
for instance

110
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,570
one of my main topics at the moment is

111
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,960
industrial security so all those those

112
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,460
PSC HMI vendors they haven't heard

113
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,409
anything about responsible disclosure

114
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,729
their first reaction if you tell them

115
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,500
well there is a vulnerability within

116
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,130
your code you will get a callback from

117
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:29,460
the legal department so even if you're a

118
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,290
security vendor the first reaction might

119
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,960
be well the development that you found

120
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,280
it isn't really a vulnerability if

121
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,630
you're going to release it you will be

122
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,780
in big trouble we're going to sue you

123
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,630
and if you take these examples it's

124
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,179
quite understandable that actually some

125
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,360
research researchers are sort where the

126
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,900
French are kind of pissed off and start

127
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,530
releasing zero-day exploits via Twitter

128
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,330
via pastebin via github and sandbox

129
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:02,900
escaper has made it to some fame right

130
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:06,390
now he or she released a few windows

131
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,190
xored exploits with the last year you

132
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,520
don't have I think the last one was two

133
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,650
weeks ago basically the the summary of

134
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,049
the tweets are here's not a zero day

135
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,090
exploits Microsoft do your job I don't I

136
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,250
don't care anymore I don't want to deal

137
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,340
with the hostile behavior when

138
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:28,169
disclosing vulnerabilities so to make a

139
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:31,560
long story short if you do find a

140
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:34,890
vulnerability one possibility is to

141
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,919
actually let's say disclose it to the

142
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:42,360
vendor but be prepared that some vendors

143
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,969
do not actually like being notified of

144
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,729
abilities so that's that's your first

145
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:51,060
choice that's this this one's the pure

146
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:52,229
white Hecker approach I find a

147
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,310
vulnerability I want to do something

148
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:57,389
good to the public

149
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:59,400
let's disclose the vulnerability okay

150
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:02,250
let's let's just turn it around if if

151
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,198
the good way doesn't work let's say if

152
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,800
the light sight doesn't work let's let's

153
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:11,389
go for the dark side let's try to sell

154
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,449
our vulnerability in the underground you

155
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:17,729
know quite funny if you take a look at

156
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:20,279
stuck photos of hackers you will find

157
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:23,520
let's say guys in hoodies no girls by

158
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,500
the way which the pity always sitting in

159
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,938
front of a monitor just being

160
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,520
illuminated by the monitor and and

161
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:34,349
trying to hack something that's don't

162
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:39,229
get me started so let's set in the

163
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:43,740
underground let's make big money there

164
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:46,080
well the truth is there is no big money

165
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:49,259
to be made by selling something at least

166
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:54,240
vulnerabilities and or exploit code in

167
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:56,699
the underground if you take a look I'll

168
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,419
say from the business perspective you

169
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:03,300
will see that most of the let's say used

170
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:07,469
exploits in common malware and common

171
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:11,360
exploit kits are kind of let's call them

172
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:14,729
antique so you will find exploits

173
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,089
targeting flash player you will find

174
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:20,878
exploits targeting is an Explorer

175
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:24,210
version five or six so pretty antique

176
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,879
stuff and still works and that's the

177
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:32,549
point where I have to think let's say

178
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:35,669
from a business perspective if you want

179
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:40,679
to make money out of your customers

180
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:44,819
sorry victims then you want to actually

181
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,920
let's say invest as less as possible and

182
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,800
at the same time get the highest return

183
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,610
of investment and now do yourself a

184
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,529
favor let's talk about those zero day

185
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,930
exploits that are going around in the

186
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,520
media

187
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,170
the typical custom would cover this one

188
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,470
in a moment the typical cost of a

189
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:07,319
zero-day exploit is something like

190
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:11,310
thirty thousand a hundred thousand up to

191
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,490
two or three million u.s. dollars so if

192
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,339
you are a common cyber criminal if you

193
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:22,560
want to make money is there any

194
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:24,210
financial sense in buying a zero-day

195
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,959
exploit for let's say a hundred thousand

196
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:33,560
dollars risking that this exploit might

197
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:37,080
be burned after first use when compared

198
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,780
if you use an exploit kit which still

199
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,550
uses the old stuff you will still get a

200
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,720
lot of infections and new customers

201
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,359
absolute victims so from a from a pure

202
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,980
financial perspective it doesn't make

203
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:55,110
sense to use let's say new zero-day

204
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,120
exploits in exploit kits because it

205
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:02,310
doesn't make sense from a financial

206
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:05,670
point of view don't get me wrong if a

207
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:08,160
zero-day exploit is discovered if it's

208
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,650
disclosed you can be quite sure that if

209
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,480
it's effective it will be one of we've

210
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:16,319
been one of those explored kids in a

211
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,260
matter of of hours but buying the

212
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:25,650
exploit doesn't make sense at least not

213
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:30,180
for those guys the other point is the

214
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:33,840
let's say effectiveness of exploit kits

215
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,880
is going down rapidly if you take a look

216
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,010
at current numbers you will see a

217
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,920
decrease in something like seventy to

218
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,140
eighty percent let's say infection rates

219
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,599
through exploit kids

220
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,170
I mean exploit kids were born were born

221
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,230
at a time where let's say most of the

222
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:56,670
victims had some kind of similar setup I

223
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:59,520
mean most had Windows XP Windows 7 it

224
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,920
was a pretty small range of used web

225
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,670
browsers of use plugins things like that

226
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,719
so you had a pretty homogeneous target

227
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,699
audience as an export gate vendor

228
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,089
and therefore the actual infection rates

229
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:18,709
were quite high now fast forward to

230
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:20,990
today if you take a look how people

231
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:23,060
actually are browsing the web today I

232
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,189
mean some of them are using Windows some

233
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,849
of them are using Mac's an Android phone

234
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:31,519
and iOS phone an Android tablet and

235
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,740
Windows tablet so this it's a pretty

236
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,279
heterogeneous environment right now

237
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:40,069
therefore the actual effectiveness of

238
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:43,310
exploit kids decreased so we have two

239
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:46,120
factors so the first one is the export

240
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:50,029
kids still work pretty well was this old

241
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:54,589
boring antique stuff and export kids in

242
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:58,399
general are decreasing from a security

243
00:11:54,589 --> 00:12:03,079
standpoint this makes kind of sense to

244
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,269
say well there is one very very very

245
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:08,508
effective way to prevent infections

246
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:11,439
using exploit kids and that's patching

247
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:16,250
it's simple patching the most or the

248
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:18,439
single if most effective way to provide

249
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,990
security if there is just one thing that

250
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:24,050
you're actually doing its patching your

251
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,579
systems because yes there are those days

252
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,059
exploits floating around in the media

253
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,559
but the truth is in reality most of

254
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:33,199
those exploit kids most of the malware

255
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:37,699
is using pretty old already patched

256
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:42,758
stuff so that's that's selling this

257
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:47,199
whole stuff in the underground ok so

258
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:53,259
let's say going going white didn't work

259
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:53,258
going black didn't work let's try grey

260
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,540
I'm pretty sure that most of you are

261
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:04,250
aware of vulnerability brokers so there

262
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:07,370
are companies out there buying exploits

263
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,059
and I mean there are a few of them out

264
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,970
there but I just picked two because

265
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:16,670
those two actually issued press releases

266
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:19,639
issued financial statements detailing

267
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:22,260
how much money they are willing to spend

268
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:25,170
on exploits actually they have a

269
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,990
price list on their website detailing

270
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:31,040
which exploit might be worth which

271
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:36,000
amount of money so the first one is

272
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:41,160
kraut fence it's a wall ability broker

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,280
based out of the UAE s of the United not

274
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,800
American United Arab Emirates and the

275
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,720
funny thing is they actually issued a

276
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,459
press release where they said well this

277
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:56,340
was in 2017 we just got our first round

278
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:59,420
of financing we collected 10 million

279
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,650
u.s. dollars for buying vulnerabilities

280
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,530
right now I double-checked yesterday

281
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,360
again they announced on the website that

282
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,880
they have their second or third round of

283
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,310
financing I think it's the second one

284
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:15,120
collecting another 15 million u.s.

285
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:17,640
dollars for buying exploits and the nice

286
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,380
thing about Crawford is the fact that he

287
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,199
will get kind of priceless you can

288
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:26,250
exactly see how much and exploit a

289
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:30,060
zero-day exploit is worth so if you if

290
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:32,180
you find let's say a let's say for iOS a

291
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,859
zero in the action remote code execution

292
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,870
with privilege escalation it will give

293
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,940
you something like up to three million

294
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,570
u.s. dollars so if you find something

295
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,880
like that in an recent iOS device no

296
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:48,480
user interaction remote code execution

297
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,780
including privilege escalation you can

298
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,650
get up to three million dollars there

299
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,420
are several other smaller prices so for

300
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,569
instance Android in some cases is a bit

301
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,880
cheaper Windows was cheaper in in the

302
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,480
past but this give could give you some

303
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,250
idea what actually what's on the table

304
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,060
if you have such a vulnerability if you

305
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:13,290
have the actual working exploit code and

306
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,560
the process that they're offering is

307
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:19,050
quite simple if you find some you can

308
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,949
contact them so you will be let's say

309
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,569
part of their of the research community

310
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:27,120
you basically have to prove that your

311
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:30,510
exploit works then you can start

312
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,120
negotiating what's the actual price for

313
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,620
that exploit will be and if crowd

314
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,810
friends decides to actually buy the

315
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,570
exploit

316
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,920
you will hand over the let's say exploit

317
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,649
coat you will get the money and

318
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,060
everybody's happy so that's that's the

319
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:48,630
short story that's how to make three

320
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,729
million u.s. dollars and crowd friends

321
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:54,089
is not the only one there is another

322
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,269
player for instance the rhodium by the

323
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,649
way I really like they their way of

324
00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:03,000
putting the different exploits in some

325
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:05,670
kind of PSE but different story so they

326
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,190
have kind of a similar price range so if

327
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:12,149
you have something like let's say zero

328
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:15,269
day exploit or an exploit targeting iOS

329
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:17,360
no user interaction privilege escalation

330
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:20,699
they call it local privilege escalation

331
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,100
or elevation then you're up to you I'm

332
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:24,569
not my question if I can read it but I

333
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,670
think it's it's in the two and a half to

334
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,829
three million range as well they have a

335
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,290
pretty nice list of different kind of

336
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:33,120
applications that they target including

337
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,779
different let's say back-end systems

338
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,690
like like Apache elasticsearch strats

339
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:41,790
Hadoop things like that so they have a

340
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,850
real kind of price list if you find

341
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,349
something tell us maybe we can get some

342
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,050
kind of agreement we will buy the

343
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,050
exploit and everybody's happy same

344
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,160
process here you basically contact them

345
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,719
it by the way everything I'm showing

346
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,519
here is public on the website there is

347
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:02,130
nothing hidden or stolen it's it's the

348
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:05,640
marketing pitch that they are using so

349
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,119
once again if you find something contact

350
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,790
them

351
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:12,479
prove that you can do what you announce

352
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:18,178
to do negotiate a nice price and go home

353
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:23,699
with a lot of money are you missing

354
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:27,689
something these are the disclosure

355
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:31,200
processes of 0 diem and crowd fans and

356
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:37,590
there is one thing that I'm actually

357
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:40,740
missing nowhere in this process will

358
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:44,309
crowd fans or 0 diem disclose the

359
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,530
vulnerability to the vendor because

360
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:48,050
that's their business model their

361
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,040
business model is

362
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:54,500
buying exploits and reselling them for a

363
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,690
very high price and take a look at their

364
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,670
target customer list the kind of

365
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,120
audiences that they want to address well

366
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:06,740
it's it's mainly law enforcement its

367
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:10,969
agencies so basically they are buying

368
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:14,810
those exploits as let's call it as a

369
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:17,390
weapon and they do not intend to

370
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:21,050
disclose the vulnerability to the vendor

371
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:24,050
and let's just let's say turn back time

372
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:26,540
for a year you know half think about

373
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:29,540
eternal blue think about wanna cry what

374
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,480
happened or what happens for a

375
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:36,860
vulnerability that's maybe able to

376
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:40,250
penetrate 90 plus percent of connected

377
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,740
Windows PCs which is able to execute

378
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,320
code on these pcs without any kind of

379
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:49,490
protection think wanna cry think not

380
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:51,439
picture or picture so basically what

381
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,200
happens here is that those

382
00:18:51,440 --> 00:19:01,760
vulnerabilities are being are being sold

383
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:06,140
are being bought and our kept hidden are

384
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,120
kept under disclosure because they want

385
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,410
to resell on they want to resell those

386
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,830
vulnerabilities which basically means it

387
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:17,570
everybody of us remains more insecure

388
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:22,669
because the vulnerabilities are still in

389
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:26,090
the code can still be exploited are not

390
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,730
disclosed to the vendor and start with a

391
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:33,290
friend that's the point that pisses me

392
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:36,650
off because I mean Security's always

393
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,149
some kind of double edged sword and if

394
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,970
you are working in a security

395
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,770
environment you want to say make and

396
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,540
this might sound cheesy but you want to

397
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,990
make the world more secure for everybody

398
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:51,830
and that's not the definition of making

399
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,900
the world secure for anybody so my point

400
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,669
here and if there is just one point that

401
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,490
you're taking out of this torque is if

402
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,930
you find a vulnerability please please

403
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,180
do me the

404
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,100
of either disclose it to the vendor or

405
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:10,200
if you don't want to deal with the

406
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:12,389
vendor use one of several open let's say

407
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,430
disclosure programs you can go through

408
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,910
Facebook's you can go through project

409
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:21,180
zero you can go through your local cert

410
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:24,650
but do not please do not sell your

411
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:27,540
vulnerability if you find something -

412
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,920
let's call it official vulnerability

413
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,139
brokers because that basically means

414
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,170
that this vulnerability will be kept

415
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,140
hidden which makes everything more

416
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:39,690
insecure for all of us and I just want

417
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,390
to give you an insight because I mean

418
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,210
working for Trend Micro I have a I have

419
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,070
my own interest in promoting the zero

420
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,190
day initiative let me just show you what

421
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:52,590
what we're actually doing because there

422
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,260
are several let's say black bounty or

423
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:59,459
disclose programs where you can send in

424
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:01,710
your availability for free project zero

425
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,720
actually is buying vulnerability so if

426
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,780
you want to make some money out of it

427
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,700
there is still the possibility to let's

428
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,470
say remain white and still make money

429
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,450
out of it

430
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:17,610
so that the eye basically is a say

431
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:21,330
collection of researchers with let's say

432
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:24,510
which are situated worldwide which do

433
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,790
collect discover and disclose

434
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:29,190
vulnerabilities through zti so that the

435
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,659
is basically buying lost vulnerabilities

436
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,150
and I have to admit we're not paying

437
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,580
three million for a zero-day iOS exploit

438
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,280
I think last year we paid out something

439
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,389
like one and a half million so if you

440
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,860
know for instance if you know pound two

441
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:44,340
own that's that's a zero day initiative

442
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,679
event the last event that they did they

443
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,689
actually made a cooperation with Tesla

444
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,400
the automotive maker and Tesla said well

445
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:54,120
if somebody of your guys succeeds in

446
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,430
hacking the car he can keep the car so

447
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:02,689
now we have two guys with a new Tesla a

448
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:06,390
different story so we are actually

449
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:08,610
providing the front-end for you to

450
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:11,280
submit vulnerabilities we are buying

451
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:14,219
them actually but the important thing is

452
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,840
we disclose those vulnerabilities

453
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,970
well to the vendor and we're talking

454
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,510
about a lot of wrong abilities if we're

455
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:25,010
talking about 2018 we're talking about

456
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:28,140
roughly 1400 vulnerabilities that were

457
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:31,789
disclosed through zti that's an increase

458
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:35,640
of I think 42 percent compared to 2017

459
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:38,720
over the whole lifetime of ZT I some

460
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,120
like five thousand five hundred roughly

461
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:46,620
vulnerabilities and the one thing that

462
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:52,168
makes me sad is hope you can see it of

463
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:55,649
those 1444 vulnerabilities 158 where

464
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:58,080
this closed as a zero-day which

465
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:02,010
basically means that we got a

466
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,840
vulnerability we informed the vendor we

467
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,419
disclosed availability to the vendor and

468
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,178
the vendor didn't react or didn't come

469
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,980
up with a patch so once we win from the

470
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:15,539
vendor this clock starts ticking and

471
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:18,059
after 69 320 days depending on the on

472
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:19,110
the vertical we're going to release it

473
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,580
that's something that we're going to

474
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,340
tell the vendor as well if you don't

475
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,809
react we will release that vulnerability

476
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,039
and a hundred fifty-eight of those were

477
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:31,710
released without the vendor either

478
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:33,750
giving any kind of response or trying to

479
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,280
sue us which by the way it's kind of

480
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,549
funny we like being sued because we

481
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,168
didn't last a single case up to now so

482
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:42,389
if you don't want to risk getting sued

483
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:46,470
just tell us and we like being getting

484
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:49,500
sued but the point is and that's the

485
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,470
most important point here is everything

486
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,250
that you're disclosing through zti is

487
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:58,380
being disclosed to the vendor as well

488
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:01,799
just to give an impression how the

489
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,950
different let's say vendors are affected

490
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:07,100
of course we're getting a lot for for

491
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,870
Microsoft we're getting a lot for Apple

492
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:14,639
what's quite funny is we we actually

493
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:18,989
bought tipping point and zti and you can

494
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,700
see this was this this was then that the

495
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,360
I starting to take a look at Trend

496
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,610
Micro's own product with this didn't

497
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,340
went well was the board but well that's

498
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,740
what

499
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,050
doing still those vulnerabilities were

500
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,210
were disclosed and and fixed but you can

501
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:37,960
see how the different vendors or how the

502
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:39,430
different verticals are affected and I

503
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,770
just want to give you an that's the

504
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:47,320
insight into the actual disclosure

505
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:52,090
process so first of all if you submit a

506
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:54,100
vulnerability to zti then after week

507
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,159
let's say after we get the vulnerability

508
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:01,379
if I will get the exploit after we you

509
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:03,760
get your money by the way we're actually

510
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,490
disclosed that vulnerability to the

511
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,160
vendor and that's one of the first steps

512
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,170
after we get the exploit get the

513
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,820
volatility and after we have confirmed

514
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:17,680
that it actually works so there is no

515
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,970
keeping away vulnerabilities from the

516
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,340
vendor it's all this closed however and

517
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,910
that's let's say that's the commercial

518
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,709
site right now is that the ion term

519
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,020
micro we are providing what we called a

520
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,840
so-called digital vaccine so we provide

521
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:38,680
a a virtual patch for that vulnerability

522
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:42,550
and we are providing that virtual patch

523
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:44,890
to our customers and no I don't want to

524
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:47,919
let's say convinced of buying current

525
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:50,230
micro it's just I want to show you why

526
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,320
we are giving away money to buy

527
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:55,060
vulnerabilities because yes we do buy

528
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,080
vulnerable ease we do spend the money

529
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:01,419
however our benefit is selling better

530
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,090
and more products or customers with a

531
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,760
let's say earlier protection so there's

532
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,649
that's that's basically our benefit so

533
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,680
in this case everybody benefits because

534
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,990
the vulnerability is getting sold is

535
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,380
getting bought so the one who's funding

536
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,030
availability will get his money we have

537
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,180
the advantage of being able to provide

538
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,700
protection earlier and still the vendor

539
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,950
is being informed about the

540
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,360
vulnerability and then the regular let's

541
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,770
say disclosure process starts so

542
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,500
basically if there is any kind of a

543
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:38,520
vendor response then we we do kind of

544
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,610
coordinate the other disclosure

545
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,530
especially if you're in

546
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,059
let's say in the ICS area so IOT

547
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,760
industrial things like that some of them

548
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:48,530
ask us to to delay the actual

549
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,450
publication date because they have to

550
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,649
fix I don't know ten thousand machines

551
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,600
out of the field but that's something

552
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:56,660
that we can talk about so the worst

553
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,669
reaction is to not respond at all but

554
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:03,140
however I said most vendors nowadays do

555
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:05,090
respond so the vulnerability might be

556
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,650
fixed might be addressed might be

557
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,070
documented that's something that we have

558
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,960
to negotiate with the vendor however

559
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:14,928
after a specific time the vulnerability

560
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,750
will be released and that's basically

561
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,130
our advantage

562
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,350
the one who's finding the vulnerability

563
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:24,650
will get the money the vendor is getting

564
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:26,629
notified and we have this list let's say

565
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,520
this this time advantage of being able

566
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,070
to provide protection earlier so there

567
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:35,600
is no nobody here let's say losing

568
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:39,260
anything in average and that's a number

569
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,820
from 2017 I think it's not like 70 or 72

570
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,070
to days in Everett that we provide a

571
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,370
protection earlier than then others

572
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:52,000
that's that's our benefit so to make a

573
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:55,189
long story short if we are talking about

574
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,250
black hats white hats great I don't like

575
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,730
those terms by the way we have to

576
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:08,000
differentiate between who's the good guy

577
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:09,860
or gal the bad and the ugly the worst

578
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,570
thing in my personal opinion that you

579
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:19,820
can do is find something which is per se

580
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:21,290
not bad and resell it either to somebody

581
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,450
in the underground which is pretty

582
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:27,980
likely as we've just seen do - let's say

583
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:30,200
financial reasons but the second worst

584
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,270
thing is selling it to a vulnerability

585
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,440
broker which does not disclose the

586
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:38,389
vulnerability to the vendor because once

587
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,929
again this means that the vulnerability

588
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:45,530
will remain in the code will remain

589
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:49,640
exploitable and makes everything more

590
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:52,500
unsecure for everybody of us if you

591
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,050
choose to let's say this

592
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,710
close it directly if you like the legal

593
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:00,540
fun you can try to disclose it let's say

594
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:03,180
on your own and just just to be honest I

595
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,850
showed you some pretty bad examples of

596
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,820
disclosure policies other vendors are

597
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,830
much better in handling vulnerabilities

598
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,080
and exploits so if if you contact them

599
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:15,320
they are much more open they are much

600
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,909
more used to the process of handling

601
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,679
submissions of vulnerabilities but there

602
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:24,870
are also some pretty bad examples so

603
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,090
either that's that's my plea at that

604
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:31,530
point either disclose the vulnerability

605
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:34,830
to the vendor and if you don't like the

606
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:37,560
let's say the legal hassle if you don't

607
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,300
like the administrative over word if you

608
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,909
don't like the I'd say the

609
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:45,389
administrative effort to disclose it to

610
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:48,180
the vendor please please PLEASE disclose

611
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,910
it through a maybe third party back

612
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,310
bounty or cert program

613
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:56,520
check your local cert check other

614
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:59,129
organizations and use them as some kind

615
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,860
of proxy to disclose of vulnerability of

616
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:04,110
course I would be happy if you take the

617
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,729
vulnerability and offer it to zero day

618
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,370
initiative because that would give us

619
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,810
the possibility to basically provide a

620
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,020
better protect for our customers but the

621
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:15,000
end of the day if I have to choice if

622
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,410
somebody's asking me who do if you have

623
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,810
the choice submitting it let's say to a

624
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:23,270
let's say - to crowd fans or to 0 diem

625
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:27,510
so one of those vulnerability brokers

626
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:30,120
versus submitting it to a third party

627
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,980
bug bounty program so that Trend Micro

628
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,939
has nothing to gain out of it I would

629
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:38,850
say well go for the bug bounty program I

630
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,460
don't care if if it's let's say if it's

631
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:45,449
Google if it's Facebook if it's cert if

632
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,730
it's if it's Secunia whatever but please

633
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,680
please PLEASE disclose it so that the

634
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,960
public will or that the vendor will

635
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:56,840
learn of it as I said I would be happy

636
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:59,850
if if it's Trend Micro's project 0

637
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,580
that's probably their the initiative

638
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,240
sorry too many acronyms but still and

639
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,980
that

640
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,870
that's my plea at that point as said

641
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,830
that's not technical please please

642
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:13,850
please stay away from those brokers who

643
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:17,809
do not disclose the vulnerability and

644
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:20,189
that should be everything from my side I

645
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,960
hope you don't mind that we kept that a

646
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,140
bit short because I just want you if

647
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,950
possible open the floor for discussions

648
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:31,020
and all questions so first of all thank

649
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,800
you very much and I think we're open to

650
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:38,940
questions aren't we

651
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:41,300
if there are any do you know how those

652
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,760
brokers make sure that the same

653
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:47,340
vulnerability is not sought to them or

654
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,900
give out to bug bounties or kind of

655
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,149
reuse like if they don't disclose to

656
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,920
vendor is there any chance of them even

657
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:57,690
learning that the same thing was solved

658
00:31:52,920 --> 00:32:01,650
many times yes and no so what actually

659
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:03,690
happens is they they they try to imply

660
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:07,290
some kind of trust into them so they say

661
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:09,660
well do you research if you found the

662
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:11,820
vulnerability well you have to trust us

663
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,320
you don't have to cannot sell it to

664
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,970
anybody else oh there are there are a

665
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,200
legal implications there are contracts

666
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,140
but at the end of the day there is

667
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,420
nothing for them to technically prevent

668
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,640
reselling the same exploit to let's say

669
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:28,890
several of those hundreds still those

670
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,200
guys and gals they talk to each others

671
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:34,020
so you can be pretty sure if you sell

672
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,480
the same exploit let's say to two crowd

673
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,760
fans or previously to boopin or to kevin

674
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,070
Mitnick whatever they know each other so

675
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,350
you're doing it maybe once but not twice

676
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:46,919
or three times so there is no no

677
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:49,050
technical limitation to do so I mean you

678
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,400
can't prevent somebody from copying the

679
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,110
export or copying the intellectual

680
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,490
property but still there are let's say

681
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,050
legal implications there are contracts

682
00:32:53,490 --> 00:33:01,740
and they know each other they talk to

683
00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:04,440
each other by the way this this scenario

684
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,300
is I want to say it's quite common but

685
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,220
it's not uncommon that the same

686
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,710
vulnerability is discovered by multiple

687
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,540
people so we have to the case that this

688
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:16,140
was quite interesting if you take a look

689
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,770
at the hacking 3 you can actually see

690
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,510
that

691
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:21,080
some of those exploits were sold to

692
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:24,510
hacking team and later on rediscovered

693
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,970
and quotes rediscovered and let's say

694
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:29,160
disclosed through product 0 or through

695
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,650
their day initiative but still it's not

696
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,800
quite that's the same person or if it's

697
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,120
just let's say the same discovery but as

698
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,430
I said there is no way to prevent it

699
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,899
it's just they tell you you have to

700
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:49,700
trust them and please please please

701
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:49,700
don't resell it to others anybody else

702
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,500
cool

703
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,500
so sure

704
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:25,269
I can't talk about the number of X plus

705
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:27,339
that where let's say discovered

706
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:31,479
disclosed to brokers because they they

707
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:35,219
don't give us numbers actually yeah so

708
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,109
so the overall number of vulnerabilities

709
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:41,649
things that the I was was in the range

710
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:43,299
of not quite sure I think 40 45 % of all

711
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:46,239
vulnerabilities that that word is closed

712
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:47,559
so you can maybe double that or triple

713
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,118
that to have round about the number of

714
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:54,190
column listed that were disclosed

715
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:56,710
publicly the the number of

716
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:59,859
vulnerabilities disclosed to let's say

717
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:02,019
to those brokers can be kind of

718
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:03,819
interfere because you know for instance

719
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:05,618
that crowd fans had ten million dollars

720
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:07,808
of fun they were funded with ten million

721
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:10,809
dollars you see the for instance that a

722
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:12,880
in iOS the road export is roughly two

723
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:16,329
and a half to three million so you can

724
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:20,650
guess it's a ballpark of let's say four

725
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:22,839
to five high profile exploits so let's

726
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,239
say Android there zero interaction

727
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:28,119
remote code execution may be combined

728
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:30,039
with roughly ten fifteen to twenty let's

729
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,799
say smaller exploits things like

730
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:35,769
exploiting exploding word exploiting

731
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:37,480
struts as exploding hadoop so ballpark I

732
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:40,379
would say that's that's really a a let's

733
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:45,970
say it guesstimated gut-feeling

734
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:49,440
2025 exploits ballpark yeah few very

735
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,730
ugly and not or undisclosed

736
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,349
vulnerabilities and to be honest that's

737
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:57,400
that's the point that that kind of gets

738
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:58,869
me angry because we see what what could

739
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,349
have happened was eternal blue I mean

740
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:04,420
wanna cry was a bad piece of malware to

741
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:08,230
be honest I mean everything that should

742
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:12,039
work didn't but still imagine a a

743
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:13,420
well-made malware with eternal blue so

744
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:16,150
not one a cry which didn't work but

745
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,829
something that actually worked and all

746
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,660
of those exploits that are that are

747
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:23,319
bought by those guys have the potential

748
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,868
to beas the next eternal blue think of n

749
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:27,190
let's say remote code execution exploit

750
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,830
in in android

751
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,090
zero in Tecton just sending you a text

752
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,350
and just sending you a link

753
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,150
you have to don't have to do anything

754
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:38,080
interesting your notification and I'm

755
00:36:34,150 --> 00:37:06,160
rooting your device that's my definition

756
00:36:38,080 --> 00:37:07,390
of ugly sorry you mean the one that if

757
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,210
you take a look at the overall numbers

758
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,770
and that's something that you can again

759
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,240
we're we're I'm quite happy that hacking

760
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,009
team happened because we're hacking team

761
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,109
you can you could see how much they they

762
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,930
paid for the experts and how much they

763
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:22,030
the result export for it's easily a

764
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:27,160
factor let's say fifteen to twenty five

765
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:31,590
on a yearly basis really because you

766
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,589
don't buy the exploit you buy a service

767
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,279
so from a business perspective it's

768
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:50,020
quite nice from a moral perspective not

769
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:53,140
so now let's let's put it that way if

770
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:56,350
you are a a law enforcement agency soft

771
00:37:53,140 --> 00:38:00,330
not not a talent agency you can buy a

772
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:02,770
service from them I mean oh let's say

773
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:05,200
brokers afterwards that you will get

774
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:07,270
that sale let's say a base it's it's a

775
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,299
command control server which allows you

776
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:13,180
to infect and let's say do surveillance

777
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,770
on victims and you will buy that service

778
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,240
that's not something that that the

779
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:18,100
rhodium or Crawford's are doing they're

780
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,589
not offering the service on their own so

781
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:24,580
they are reselling those vulnerabilities

782
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:26,050
but the other service but those about

783
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:29,200
those law enforcement agencies they will

784
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:33,130
get the service if you are a let's say

785
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:35,649
government agency then few of them are

786
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:39,030
buying from brokers like them and most

787
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,030
of them are doing their own thing

788
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:50,410
anything else cool so thank you very

789
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,270
much for sticking with me although

790
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,200
that's the I assume that this was the

791
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:57,860
most most non-technical session at all

792
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,859
[Applause]
