1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,959
we actually use this to teach children

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:05,730
because normally you are scolding it's

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,309
always difficult to give someone

4
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:13,139
rewarding you create something like you

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:23,070
can direct satisfaction by moral support

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,160
Oh we'll make a 20

7
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:41,810
okay open skate making some physical

8
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:57,590
things so I always makes myself about a

9
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,630
how many people nowadays you have 3d

10
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,520
printers but how little people that

11
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,190
actually have 3d printers may stuff

12
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,770
themselves to product I find that most

13
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,600
people that 3d printers just spend all

14
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,010
their time on thinking first finding

15
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,300
things that other people have decided

16
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,610
that what they print out for me in my

17
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,530
shower I think the whole purpose is

18
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,180
getting a 3d printer is to make your own

19
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,120
picture but a lot of people struggle

20
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,130
making things in 3d if you go to the

21
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,200
normal graphical drawing programs at

22
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,240
fusion 360

23
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,580
even a deeper guess I don't know but

24
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,259
sometimes quite a hard struggle to start

25
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,539
design or something so I perfect they

26
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,460
did great alternative to making things

27
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,680
by using something we'll open that's it

28
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,470
what is open if it's open source it's

29
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,840
available on any platform you can think

30
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,479
of Linux Windows Mac it runs on a

31
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,560
Raspberry Pi so literally any kind of

32
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,000
classwork we can see really well I'm a

33
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,280
very shitty old laptop on anything you

34
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,500
can you can run this you know it's very

35
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,270
accessible and it is a an intern it's

36
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,620
not an interactive mower that you're

37
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,810
drawing in bomba drawing you can modify

38
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,180
things no you write code you press a

39
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,000
button and it generates the 3d model for

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,449
T that's the basic concept of what

41
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,490
OpenScape does so just to give you a

42
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,789
simple example and one of them so there

43
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:17,680
are some basic shapes in life right you

44
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,539
have a cube you have a sphere

45
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,669
you got a cylinder or some more complex

46
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,330
shape the reference is what to have a

47
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,030
cube I think we just get the command

48
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,150
cube with its width depth and height and

49
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,509
it tells me the cube of those dimensions

50
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,310
and this is these numbers represent

51
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,110
whatever you want them to represent in

52
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,270
my case I use millimeters because my

53
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,219
printer set to bit of intercept so this

54
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:43,719
case it will draw a cube for 1

55
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,430
centimeter by 1 centimeter by 1

56
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,240
centimeter very very simple the syntax

57
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,979
by the way if you've ever developed code

58
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,159
is very much like a C language so at the

59
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,229
end of any commands you have to do a

60
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:56,979
semicolon

61
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:59,949
that's the separation to go to the next

62
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,500
command and it doesn't matter if you

63
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,570
write 5 comments on one line or one

64
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,000
command per line or you spit a comment

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,190
above both lines the semicolon is the

66
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,349
differentiator between going from one

67
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,830
commands to the other commands so

68
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,150
besides the cube shape there are some

69
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,639
other shapes and when you start looking

70
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,999
around you in life

71
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,649
recognizing all these basic shapes and

72
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,939
everything in Hollywood there you see

73
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,619
they recreated the one dollar of every

74
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,169
common basic shape is a cylinder

75
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,209
something brought to and it has a radius

76
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:33,119
step with the are steps work from the

77
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:36,599
middle point to the outside all of the

78
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,739
different use radius in diameter you

79
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:43,110
quickly learn to make 12 mistakes you

80
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,349
can also specify t is so diameter is 4

81
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:47,429
do all the way to the left to the right

82
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,709
the radius is from the middle to the

83
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,379
outside so this will create a cylinder

84
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,619
of 1 centimeter thick at 1 meter and 1

85
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:58,369
centimeter height

86
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,550
so I have my senator here if I for

87
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,380
instance special prize two radiuses

88
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,890
sergeant specialized radius one radius

89
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:52,580
two now so different basic shapes the

90
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,570
cube the cylinder and I guess that the

91
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,960
other basic shape is a sphere the

92
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:09,470
spheres of a basically if you look

93
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,420
around everything pretty much you see

94
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,780
you can make out of those three shapes

95
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,310
especially because in this language

96
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,560
the key thing what you can do is you can

97
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,770
do operations on two objects at the same

98
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,670
time so one of the operations that you

99
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,490
can do is in difference and what does

100
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,710
the difference command do very simple it

101
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,900
draws whatever you first say completely

102
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,360
and everything else that you have to are

103
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,679
specifying its obstruction it's from it

104
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,260
so again did it see syntax so you have a

105
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,820
difference which is a function so that's

106
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,490
why you have to the brackets and then

107
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,960
you have the curly bracket opening

108
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,940
including record closing which defines

109
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,450
whatever is your difference bars and

110
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,710
then we said the first thing you drop

111
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,590
within that part it drops so I draw a

112
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,970
cube and then I also draw a cylinder but

113
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,790
actually that is then being removed from

114
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,030
that too and so this way I end up having

115
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,689
a square

116
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:19,189
so yes so I will give you pleasure on

117
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:22,429
the cheat sheet so there are some more

118
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,350
complex ones but the most commonly wants

119
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,319
to use is a difference which stretch you

120
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,569
have something called intersection so

121
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,529
that's only where the two objects meet

122
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,179
so the only wear effort is over that the

123
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,959
team or the object that is what stage

124
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,569
you have a union which just combines it

125
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:42,829
as one module that doesn't really change

126
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:46,550
the shape but the one I love a lot that

127
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,689
is the whole command

128
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:48,860
I think I'll show you that you're an

129
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,649
example so so let me give you an example

130
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,869
so one command that you will learn is

131
00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:58,610
the moment you drop anything in holders

132
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,509
by definition it draws it from 0 of 0.0

133
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,089
coordinates so at the dead center in the

134
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:08,420
middle of all of your grid so with the

135
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,050
commence translate you can decide that

136
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,449
you want to place it somewhere else so

137
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:15,920
what is he here just from the syntax

138
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,509
perspective some people begin the

139
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:22,549
translate meant you should not end with

140
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:25,309
the semicolon because you end up event

141
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:29,420
so the translates without semicolon will

142
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,639
then apply to whatever you specify next

143
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,309
on it you have to do our commands as

144
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:35,540
well like if you have the rotate command

145
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,360
or summary commands make sure that

146
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,740
they're part of the command so that the

147
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,249
decibel that so here I am drawing on 0

148
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:47,209
the 0.0 of the centipoise cylinder I

149
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,170
draw a 3 centimeters to the right

150
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,679
cylinder and I draw 3 centimeters up a

151
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,329
citizen so I got at least three

152
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:00,259
cylinders place very simply then there

153
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,999
is this command to go to Hall command

154
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:04,670
and when a whole command of inattention

155
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,860
whatever object you've placed draws a

156
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,049
parameter around it and they exactly to

157
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:12,559
a object and this can be complex this is

158
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,649
actually a hollow 2d object right I have

159
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:16,550
two cylinders

160
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,640
if I for instance have a similar

161
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,870
floating in the middle of the top I did

162
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,810
we get a kind of pyramid kind of shape

163
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,510
so whatever wherever you place shapes it

164
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,390
will make the whole the shell are

165
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,510
wrapped in completely - do I think this

166
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,180
is very powerful command looks about to

167
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,010
think of it you very easily just play

168
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,600
some dots and then you put the whole rub

169
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,880
you structure your much more complex

170
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
shape if you want it also is very common

171
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,040
in the uses where you start 3d printing

172
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,140
you typically don't work very square

173
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,690
corners you typically one round corners

174
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,140
a lot of things instead of throwing a

175
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,150
cube I think we always draw Forks in the

176
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,420
nurse with radius so that I have a cube

177
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,580
with rounded corners and is that this is

178
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,350
a programming language and because it is

179
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,570
a programming language I can start

180
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,340
really using all the kinds of

181
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,320
programming elements making modules

182
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,540
making my own functions to simplify my

183
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,810
own life now when you draw something

184
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,410
from here I said I am drawing the the

185
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,030
first video shot with the hall I crawled

186
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,760
three cylinders around death I throw a

187
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,730
difference so with the different if it

188
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,470
draws the first thing first so it draws

189
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,000
up anything that's within the Hall

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,220
commanded treats this one object is what

191
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,750
that's why he draws that and then I

192
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,330
literally remove again identically did

193
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,950
same three cylinders with just a smaller

194
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,860
diameter so I get that shape with three

195
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:51,380
holes in it so very simple now as I said

196
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,540
it is a programming language and if

197
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,980
you've never programmed before in life

198
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,540
this is a great method to learn

199
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,190
programming but of course one of the key

200
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,660
things about programming is to be able

201
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,270
to reuse your code and make it very

202
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,170
simple

203
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,019
as much as possible so what I can do is

204
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,089
what I had a check that I just had I can

205
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,519
create marshals and this is my own

206
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,470
command that I just create on the fly so

207
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,089
I can make a module to make a triangle

208
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,029
with its bit right I make it with a

209
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,240
parameter and what that does to dress

210
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,699
those trees but the places those three

211
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:25,010
cylinders they put all around it based

212
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,079
on the wisdom and the distances between

213
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,850
is that is how I can specify it very

214
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,279
easy then what the size of my triangle

215
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,010
is and in my main program and every now

216
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,350
just have more line of code I have drawn

217
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,420
me a triangle with whatever trying to

218
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,910
admit that I need so this really allows

219
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,480
you to extremely simplify your code that

220
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,940
we use every single time if you have a

221
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,320
certain object that you want a job just

222
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,639
maybe with different dimensions and

223
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,980
those types of things same thing for the

224
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,930
whole size of module for my holes with

225
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,760
the diameter of the whole zoo then just

226
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,709
use a difference men again to take those

227
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:00,170
holes out and I definitely I think it's

228
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,360
always best practice in the beginning of

229
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,070
your program you specify your key

230
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,199
barriers and this is especially if you

231
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,630
start reading printing your objects very

232
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,670
important because when you start 3d

233
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,890
printing every 3d printer has a

234
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,959
different tolerance so even though I

235
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,310
measure something should be four

236
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,190
millimeters and I breathe it out might

237
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,320
be three point nine five or four foot

238
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,720
and sometimes just that 45 millimeter

239
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,579
makes it not fit or makes it fit and

240
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:27,709
that's really where open sky becomes

241
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:29,990
extremely easy if you work at fusion and

242
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,640
was anything especially like a think of

243
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,070
that later on modifying everything is

244
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,649
just sometimes a pain in the ass here

245
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,980
you modify your parameter rerender and

246
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,589
you're done so it's very simple to

247
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:45,130
iterate

248
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,110
and adjust your mobile if you work well

249
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,550
with bare meters now to learn from

250
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,100
examples I know you know things first

251
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,920
but safety first number one website

252
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,900
pretty much for everybody download

253
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,990
from on things worse if you actually go

254
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,090
and explore there's a some people

255
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,150
customizable things that means that all

256
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,250
these objects that you see here you can

257
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,500
customize and why can you customize them

258
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,290
because every single object you see here

259
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,440
is written in open eschaton it is

260
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,720
written using this language what it also

261
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,520
means is that you can therefore steal

262
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,770
from it so if I find something that like

263
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,030
particular shape here you can open up

264
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,410
and customize it to start

265
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:14,390
so just open skip but here you can be

266
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,920
concealed look at this verse was very

267
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,329
clearly the beginning of this code

268
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,119
that's assigned to main the main

269
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:31,820
parameter so one thing on this so when

270
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,190
you start designing you will very often

271
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,490
vendor right you can decide what quality

272
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,620
you want to render and this is something

273
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,270
that I think you need to be aware so

274
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,309
even the top of the program you see this

275
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,380
string and any function standing there

276
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,740
that defines the quality or how high you

277
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,960
want to render your model while we were

278
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
designing you probably want to have that

279
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,790
extremely low like or something like

280
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,850
that

281
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,920
super read and then when you want to

282
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,320
Tweety print it then you want to crank

283
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,990
this up redwood one more time and then

284
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,910
you can save that from STL file which

285
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,650
you didn't send to your to your printer

286
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:26,390
so so as you can see they clearly have

287
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,580
defined at the beginning the variables

288
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,440
they make some nice comments about so we

289
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,740
know how to other of these things do and

290
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,360
then you can just find it go so you can

291
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,559
actually have a look at how they made it

292
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,929
make modifications stewards know like

293
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:41,750
and stuff so signatures have gone is a

294
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,490
it's a great way to yeah still learn

295
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,490
from others and I can tell you that a

296
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,150
very common time objects there are

297
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,830
definitely openscad language forms so if

298
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,050
you needed here don't go thinking about

299
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,400
making your own gear

300
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,100
there are some super my briefs for open

301
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,440
skate for gear making you just special I

302
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,300
need to be I won with t12 or whatever

303
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,190
name or multiple type of gear with so

304
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,590
many cruisers nowhere hit the button and

305
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,390
you get your gear and then you can still

306
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,610
make modifications to them yeah

307
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,930
programming language so you can download

308
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,330
the digital libraries have an including

309
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,820
your program and you can approach them

310
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,100
same thing for text there is some basic

311
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,780
text for people to scan if you want to

312
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,380
put letters but there are some really

313
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,280
cool libraries to make really pretty 3d

314
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,930
kind of shape text and those kinds of

315
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,090
things so if you start search you can

316
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,180
always get modules you'll find thousands

317
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,030
of copies of libraries for almost

318
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,170
anything

319
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,180
does that thingy first raised a great

320
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,650
source if you have if you want to make

321
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,840
your Raspberry Pi cakes or Arduino cakes

322
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,520
or something like that but you want it

323
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,620
to be different just frame the basic one

324
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,900
that already lists as the base of what

325
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,450
you want and then you just go and change

326
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,850
it in whatever your specifications or

327
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,480
something like that

328
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,940
so though these verses is a great place

329
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,440
to find you find some really nice

330
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,730
examples there

331
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,100
it's edition for instance combination

332
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,230
block and they make is important open

333
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,090
sketch because that's your open sketch

334
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,520
you can define what combination should

335
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,600
be openings a lot it's not a stick shop

336
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,980
using your program what the number

337
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,370
should be

338
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,600
work and thinking first has a GUI in

339
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,340
front of your open sketch file so it

340
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,320
reads out the first parameter that you

341
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,910
would find in your program and it

342
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,580
pretends that into a nice equal menu but

343
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,290
you can just download this file and edit

344
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,650
an open sketch I think there's a few

345
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,510
sort button there that would just show

346
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,610
your fur coat and you could just copy

347
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,780
another example we need to keep someone

348
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,140
made complete overstep program to

349
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,070
generate piece based on a picture but

350
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,960
even never that one the quick sets you

351
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,160
give a quick technique with your

352
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,830
especially the US common type of key you

353
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,360
just need to know the number of the key

354
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,250
which is written on the key you type it

355
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:26,530
in your own generate key for unity sorry

356
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,240
so you find me from artistic stuff to

357
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,340
very practical stuff or anything in

358
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,140
between ooh final on finis fierce desire

359
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,810
to open sketch and then on those two

360
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,790
extremes you find a lot of always get

361
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,650
stuff maybe more traditional things

362
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,750
people design you in a fuchsia or in the

363
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,510
more classical 3d design project but

364
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,940
your muscles you have those insane faces

365
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,470
right that people 3d print with very

366
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,330
organic shapes in it

367
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,460
trust me you cannot make that into a

368
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,800
standard 3d design program while the

369
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,930
outputs get this is just a loop with

370
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,030
some sinus or something like that five

371
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,340
lines of code you have the most complex

372
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,720
face or poplar or drinking bottle

373
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,700
whatever you want so because it is a

374
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,020
programming language there are some

375
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,120
things that you can do an open SK you

376
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,090
cannot do with any other design method

377
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,840
or something like that

378
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,170
because it is highly programmable to

379
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:29,570
work so for today I would like you to

380
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,300
see if you could design something and I

381
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,420
actually sometimes give this programming

382
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,680
schedule to children and to move on to

383
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:45,110
big spinners spinner is nice because of

384
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,450
spinner superfast bridge so we can

385
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,890
really do a workshop with children where

386
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,810
we teach them in one hour you open scale

387
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,460
in only 30 minutes we print out their

388
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,340
very quick results in physically in

389
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,780
their hand and I didn't know you if

390
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,190
you've never done this before go make

391
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,660
something I will print it out for you

392
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,850
this weekend and so you give me what

393
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,290
you've made on your screen if you are

394
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,520
out there you can have in your hands

395
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,110
it's a very magical feeling that I

396
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,090
already started making some basic shell

397
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,310
casing for it to put it in and so you

398
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,540
can try to see if you can make a case

399
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,940
for your batch which again should not be

400
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,280
able to pick up a print if you want to

401
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,260
make sure of course that the back end is

402
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,910
open as well so you can have components

403
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,540
on the batch of websites it's five by

404
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,880
five to patch the radius in the corners

405
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,240
is five millimeters and the holes are

406
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,030
about five millimeters computed to two

407
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,550
corners that you have in them it's a

408
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,630
very basic if you want to make something

409
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,320
else absolutely feel free I have it set

410
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,880
up before you directly go make what you

411
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,130
want to make simple exercise for you

412
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,320
here just to learn how to make some

413
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,150
basic change the distractions to make a

414
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,770
whole pencil so you can run through this

415
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,130
if you want and I

416
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,950
the basic commands on it that you need

417
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,410
for most on OpenScape of gum there is a

418
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,419
bigger cheat sheet which is living all

419
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:13,210
the commands but then you might the tree

420
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,289
in the forest because of the

421
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,360
overwhelming stuff so maybe this is a

422
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,120
bit easier if you don't want to sit here

423
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,919
you can feel free to go back and you

424
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,929
need any help just Yelp now come help

425
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,530
you if you have an issue with making it

426
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,390
in the end if you did make something you

427
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,610
really want to get that gratification of

428
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,190
having us disappear in on the wiki I put

429
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,640
my email on there in the program item of

430
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,799
eth0

431
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:41,730
so tell me whatever you've made and I

432
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,289
will print it out for you in case you

433
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:45,610
want to know how that works

434
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,919
so in open escape when you have made

435
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,770
your model all we need to hear is that

436
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,270
third resolution of and how I render it

437
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,530
so one thing I forgot to send our

438
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,360
students of rendering organized yet

439
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,260
there is f5 and there is f6 from a

440
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,809
managed function at 500 600 pieces at

441
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:08,530
five six and five renders extremely fast

442
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:14,080
but not accurate so for printing you

443
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,940
already take in their section f6 button

444
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,950
and then it will take that resolution

445
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,960
into account when you have not that you

446
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,340
can also just send me no openers get

447
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,950
file that will render for you you can

448
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,620
just export it to an STL file this is

449
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,530
the standards power grid which everyone

450
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,140
uses which is a setter but you can also

451
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,270
open it up then and mention make sure in

452
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,309
any other 3d program you can open up a

453
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,190
different potential solids 3d file and

454
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,710
then if you have a 3d printer you just

455
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,409
go do your slicing software you open up

456
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,750
that STL file which slices in the way

457
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,659
how you imprinted with the 3d

458
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:50,980
software and it's really printing

459
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,590
software I defined how I print it right

460
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,030
how long were printed

461
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,180
with plastic you don't decide that your

462
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,700
mobile you just make a solar bubble and

463
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,260
then I'll print it out for you so if you

464
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,490
want to see how that works if you want

465
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,410
to slice it yourself and be more than

466
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,370
happy to do so

467
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,190
and send it to but it just go make

468
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,580
something from a simple batch with your

469
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,090
name on it

470
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,420
- DJ said don't make something too big

471
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,340
if you want to have it printed this

472
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,640
weekend make it relatively small and I

473
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,890
should be able to count both most of

474
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,210
your place today

475
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,980
I'll need to print about knives at the

476
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:39,440
same time any questions yes yeah so you

477
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,840
can go quite complex of a opens can

478
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,230
support studio and and 3d drawing so if

479
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,450
you a or either manually draw I'd like

480
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,190
to be by the edges by five points and

481
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,540
then like any other normal program you

482
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,840
can extrude from it making it a 3d shape

483
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,240
you can do the no sub a so principle a

484
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,020
DXF file so if you have something in a

485
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,080
coral draw or something else drawing as

486
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,540
factors as a 2d shape like a logo or

487
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,730
something typically used make sure you

488
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,610
can save it as a DXF file most programs

489
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,700
but the exact detail for sure then you

490
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,800
can insert you can upload you can load

491
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,260
it in open sketch that one hammer should

492
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,630
shoot extrude and then you have a 3d

493
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,360
found 100 commands if you want to do it

494
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,740
more manually knocks draw a sphere

495
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,580
somewhere else

496
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,420
the recent commands in open sketch to

497
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,730
little bit just specify forage in 3d

498
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,800
space and based on all those points if

499
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,400
you make you reshape and so you can in

500
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,670
theory make any shape you want because

501
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,590
the more points you specify more but

502
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,530
it's more difficult to get your mind set

503
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,570
around so have a look at it's on the

504
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,720
teaching

505
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,030
the only other shape is we'll find

506
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,890
that's people working to use but it's

507
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,140
more complexity but if you look and

508
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,570
everything right use it just a cylinder

509
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,370
with a double cylinder of two different

510
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,580
radiuses everything you've got very

511
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,010
edited the two but this is a cube profit

512
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,110
corner so this cylinders there's a

513
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,240
rotating mathematical but this case here

514
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,220
I'm rotating by cylinder horizontally

515
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,870
put the whole Dartmouth and I would be

516
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,870
there on that box see when you start

517
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,950
looking at everything

518
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,020
most things you've been very easy made

519
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,169
from a cylinder or Cupid a sphere but if

520
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:27,880
you want to make a cube all the way the

521
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,010
grounders corners you just place a

522
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,179
Spears right for spheres on the top the

523
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,909
four spheres on the pump in the top make

524
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:39,850
a hole and you can have a cube with the

525
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,340
rounded corners right because that's

526
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,760
what the spheres will do for you again

527
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,700
if you put the force in so you can make

528
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,490
3d quite pretty shape with just these

529
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,380
basic shape

530
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:08,649
so yes I'm not sure the mother feel

531
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:11,380
because if you scan something in 3d if

532
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,059
the important up will be the thinnest

533
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:17,020
and tens of thousands but I'm sure how

534
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,080
the hope with scanners like that I think

535
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,000
that dickham U and W seaboard adorable

536
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,529
mesh makes your seat brushes of those

537
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,620
kinds of things of the world and is it

538
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,029
designed more like product and

539
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:29,200
functional development this is

540
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,510
definitely not something to modify I

541
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:49,320
[Music]

542
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,270
guess we just go back and remember that

543
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:59,080
I make if you have questions I'll help

544
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,610
you get stuck you don't know how to make

545
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,190
a particular shape something out I can

546
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,570
quickly quite typically make the whole

547
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,669
thing in a few lines of code and then

548
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:09,270
just whatever you make send it to me

549
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,279
just make sure you before you said that

550
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,260
you one time we go to your code that you

551
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,940
did not make mistakes with diognetus

552
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,789
radius because I would pretend whatever

553
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:20,860
you send me I don't know what you go or

554
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,399
not you think you've got it right you

555
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,929
learn I think it's a pretty big five

556
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:29,399
times before I get it right stuff

557
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,119
[Music]

558
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,420
the documents on the on the week

559
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:58,200
so is SK SK not

560
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,500
[Music]

[Music]

563
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:05,160
so if it makes a shake

564
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:24,599
so if I resisted this sphere to

565
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:37,390
somewhere else right now sphere cube

566
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,450
right if I have to go home and around

567
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:51,839
this you will see if you make a shape of

568
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,839
that

569
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,530
it's likely and rape wrapping paper

570
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,480
around something around all the edges

571
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,920
that you enjoyed were straightforward

572
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,050
comes up in as you can see if you can

573
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,510
see this this up here you you couldn't

574
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:14,420
imagine that this is just to shake ok

575
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:23,430
just to shake so that's a you can use

576
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,730
Hallford yeah to make much more complex

577
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,530
changes what you do with the Hoffman you

578
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,660
draw the base of change the whole around

579
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:38,460
and if you're you're amazing but makes

580
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,760
that same circle for instance in in

581
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,420
different spots

582
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:50,210
four of these circles

583
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,480
so I I had four four four circles right

584
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,239
the ninth town face will get me my food

585
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:16,140
was all around a dish I got it very nice

586
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,759
around the corner

587
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:21,559
I been right you can use the Minkowski

588
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:29,730
sorry yeah but Minkowski it can do very

589
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,950
conflicts but it's very complex to

590
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,799
understand its behavior is very

591
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:41,960
comforting and so unless you go read an

592
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,509
EP use tons of minors in the beginning

593
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:49,249
just learn to make the basic shape

594
00:43:57,049 --> 00:44:00,329
function myself if I make a new function

595
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:03,989
called cube with orders and use the

596
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,910
various it's a super simple function to

597
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:13,098
make an amazing it I think one thing you

598
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,660
he has a really learn when you design

599
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,279
for trainee printing print above because

600
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,809
he also go there was a difficulties are

601
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:22,019
pretty pretty good whatever I design I

602
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:23,940
also immediately thinking I printed

603
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,029
without supports strong fully adult

604
00:44:27,029 --> 00:44:28,890
writing so you have to really combine

605
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,349
the knowledge of design with the

606
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:33,150
limitations of 3d printers we start

607
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,809
making very

608
00:44:36,279 --> 00:45:05,019
so everything I had yes so that's only

609
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:27,739
defined raw spaces so where you can

610
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:33,109
specify the spaces the corner and it

611
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:34,730
will make you get shape whatever

612
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,599
whatever so you can maintain that shape

613
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:44,380
by just specifying the corners the faces

614
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:50,690
right because this shape while it is

615
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,420
make with all these polygons I can also

616
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,670
make this does the basic shape because

617
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,759
if I want to have sloped formers I can

618
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:00,739
just do a difference with a rotate knock

619
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:08,109
you to get the same effect so many ways

620
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:11,969
here in the beginning on Hydra you just

621
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,529
stick with the basic shake and be

622
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:16,650
creative to fit using Rogaine using the

623
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,660
whole command usually do you can get

624
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:27,828
very far because if you see this you go

625
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,190
[Music]

626
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:59,279
straight to make a hexagon so a hexagon

627
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:04,859
is six squares with a rotation in a loop

628
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:18,719
that's one with the ground this is a

629
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,339
programming language so you use a fork

630
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:23,609
event write the loop so you need to draw

631
00:47:23,609 --> 00:47:27,299
six times so you can also never make a

632
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:36,269
marker if you want to talk to calm power

633
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:39,649
you know a little bit about the program

634
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:53,279
the rotate commands to know which access

635
00:47:53,279 --> 00:47:55,199
to rotate get the right of Texas are

636
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,189
often proud

637
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:20,069
yeah yeah

638
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,419
[Music]

639
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,119
hi

640
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,489
[Music]

641
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:08,660
I already - you say you know the working

642
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:13,640
color by the way many different parts

643
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,230
you want to make it different big color

644
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,930
so color code before each beat you draw

645
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:22,940
so then you gives you one tip by the way

646
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,770
while you're all hanging away something

647
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,150
that's actually very useful when you

648
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,520
start doing these complex commands so

649
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:49,550
imagine I am doing this this will be a

650
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,050
common scenario you do a difference

651
00:51:51,050 --> 00:52:01,790
around this you're like I don't see my

652
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,430
cylinder where where is it

653
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,500
and maybe you're miss placing it in a

654
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,410
canister so in openscad when you write

655
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,300
an exclamation mark in front of

656
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,850
something it will only render deadline

657
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,860
you can do two lights with just

658
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,880
information mark

659
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:24,230
so now if I bring vendor it I'll see my

660
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:27,380
I see where my cinemas so wow this need

661
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,170
a difference commands whatever I will

662
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:31,640
not see it to mention high places in the

663
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,650
middle of an object and I don't see it I

664
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,050
don't know vibration it correctly by

665
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,550
putting an extra dimension mark in front

666
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:40,370
of it it just isolates that part of the

667
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,070
code and it will only draw that part

668
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:44,510
especially the long program remarking

669
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,550
everything happens and stuff it's

670
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,050
something very you should just put an

671
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,610
exclamation mark up on to Mike that

672
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:52,330
you're starting with

673
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,030
you can put on any line so we find it I

674
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:21,870
think if I move on this line you're

675
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:25,860
struggling with one height you conceive

676
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:38,960
the overall especially difference here

677
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,960
here

678
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,020
but this is something I've made to mount

679
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,849
a Raspberry Pi you talk about big fit

680
00:55:40,849 --> 00:55:44,180
and it fresh fit so this is a mount for

681
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,980
a respite to mount the Raspberry Pi to a

682
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,609
pole

683
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,829
I make segi scanner so I have a hundred

684
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:50,240
twenty raspberry PI's mounted to

685
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:58,250
radiator pipes my frames you can very

686
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,130
specially fire your full diameter so

687
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,790
this is again the left partner to rotate

688
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,500
or a treatment from a pretty nice

689
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,560
outfits of the ghost it's full with

690
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,430
three screws and in here fits literary

691
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:16,190
Raspberry Pi on the two holes of the

692
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:18,410
photo confident and Express fit so they

693
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:21,410
both go in in the actual holes of living

694
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:23,690
them it doesn't move and these slide

695
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,240
course over there at the board over the

696
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,180
board this is a super snug fit for

697
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:38,510
editor yeah that goes in the holes of it

698
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:41,940
so that mass will not slide up and down

699
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,750
[Music]

700
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:47,300
and and this is again when I designed so

701
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,550
I will write I am your scanner has to

702
00:56:49,550 --> 00:57:10,550
make 120 of these things these are just

703
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,130
radiated for you

704
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:15,130
whatever

705
00:57:32,900 --> 00:58:44,090
this is my design

706
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:20,100
so I'm a soccer cooks I suffer to do all

707
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:29,610
that so i broadcast to exactly the same

708
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:31,790
time

709
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,650
because I actually make to so much

710
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:37,340
I made one so if you look at the scanner

711
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:46,890
there are with any camera you're from

712
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:50,850
one of even 3d scan anything that does

713
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:55,740
not do you take hundreds of power of

714
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,660
ceramic photogrammetry shaft where you

715
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:02,690
put up your super perfectly I can scare

716
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:11,850
people but photogrammetry is based on

717
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:15,390
texture so three cameras need to be able

718
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:18,090
to identify a unique spot that they know

719
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:21,300
it's the same spot because they see it

720
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,860
from three different angles they can try

721
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,350
it like you know where six of space now

722
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,760
if you will be wearing a white t-shirt

723
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,420
or pure black t-shirt from my dad and I

724
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,780
made fun of it just white or black like

725
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,490
a hundred pounds of dish

726
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:38,190
whoa I wouldn't be able to treat it so

727
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:44,040
what I do is my computer projectors and

728
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,560
then two photos very good later on

729
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:51,660
and then the computer pressure to turn

730
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,980
and it projects

731
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,340
I know you can see them the left Bend of

732
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,170
noise known on a grid

733
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,610
there's a quickly in there as well but

734
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,530
this is making written of course but

735
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:03,570
that gives each photo no matter if it

736
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:06,150
has texture or not the textures are we

737
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:09,230
can find the 3d stuff

738
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,970
because we still use the right foot

739
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,170
before the actual color information

740
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,060
right because the end with my double

741
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:19,320
time people with normal but the

742
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,700
difference between those two would

743
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:25,710
need to be very shortly I'm diving into

744
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:35,160
the extreme diamantina two photos to 70

745
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,010
participants so there's an meantime you

746
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:41,010
need to I'll make a projector for jet

747
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,140
and a projector and it works don't

748
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,410
instantly projected images where skin

749
01:02:45,410 --> 01:03:23,670
languor on the surface of the river just

750
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:28,710
hoping negative the network network and

751
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:37,640
my software will scan

752
01:03:56,930 --> 01:04:00,009
[Music]

753
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:39,380
so yeah yeah use official risk for the

754
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,710


755
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,140
anyway

756
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:10,300
[Music]

757
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,379
[Music]

758
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:39,580
because okay

759
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:51,240
yeah a cool car just gets printed

760
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:59,730
printed on a 663 systems so this is me

761
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:05,520
3d printed and this is a comparison so

762
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,820
the left one is scanned using a Nikon

763
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:12,440
hundred combat camera 90s were chosen

764
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:38,330
because every single scan it figures out

765
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,399
if you walk in my skin right now the

766
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:43,830
radiated by very powerful being solid

767
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:45,720
you touch any my cameras you do not

768
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,880
write anything you know every single

769
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,279
scan the software calculate what the

770
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:51,839
position of the actors are aware they

771
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,479
are so so there's no calibration needed

772
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,000
up front in any form or shape now many

773
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,040
people when you scan it doesn't know

774
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,140
anything about real values so it doesn't

775
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,490
know what a meter is or anything like

776
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:02,729
that

777
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:08,389
so in most photogrammetry software

778
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:14,779
so

779
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,330
so I can be my Skinner I have markers

780
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,939
that the software can recognize these

781
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:33,160
are like the QR codes and they are comes

782
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,100
on a specified distance we think that

783
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,560
software I can then specify the accurate

784
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,299
distance between Delhi level we then

785
01:09:40,299 --> 01:09:42,130
will actually calibrate the actual scan

786
01:09:42,130 --> 01:10:09,370
in real sizes and how yeah so I some of

787
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:10,960
my customers are doctors that are making

788
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,940
it so there's like company that started

789
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,300
out with tu Delft and they make braces

790
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,090
for people who are righteous they use my

791
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:32,740
scanner the energized you stick one

792
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,270
thing you still need always no matter

793
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:36,400
how big the surface you need relatively

794
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,090
always because the end of degree no

795
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,160
matter if it's big or small has to be

796
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,990
over them so you only need about

797
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:48,990
eighteen at least 18 spots Congrats

798
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,720
I think I think the three rows cameras

799
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,760
with making the frame is the space

800
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,670
between your fingers the tentacles so

801
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,840
that depends on how more accepting more

802
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,430
cameras relation that the next camera

803
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:03,330
occlusion you have

804
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:08,919
a student project data for company now

805
01:11:08,919 --> 01:11:10,800
running worldwide that they

806
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,639
professionally make these braces for

807
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:17,979
people it's very accurate and it's a

808
01:11:17,979 --> 01:11:19,809
very basic we're extremely happy because

809
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:22,300
normally they used to do cast what we

810
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,249
just eat or anything

811
01:11:24,249 --> 01:11:26,130
and now they're 3d printers out of SLA

812
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:29,979
they're going to be flexible because it

813
01:11:29,979 --> 01:11:36,459
helps support for people who are writers

814
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:51,669
- joy - yeah so we have a lot of a lot

815
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:53,050
of customers using this for all kinds of

816
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:55,449
reasons not just for a figurine for that

817
01:11:55,449 --> 01:11:58,510
but for that expertise but that people

818
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,159
from the clothing industry that uses

819
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:04,539
this to do made-to-measure clothing that

820
01:12:04,539 --> 01:12:07,809
kind of stuff I have doctors using it

821
01:12:07,809 --> 01:12:10,119
for kinds of research for schools and

822
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:12,429
for support processes for lives and all

823
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:14,590
those kinds of things now the only thing

824
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:16,239
that really decides the accuracy is not

825
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,860
some photogrammetry is an extremely

826
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,630
accurate method if you compare to like

827
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:20,860
an Arctic scanner which is very

828
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,179
expensive device because the device

829
01:12:22,179 --> 01:12:25,360
moves there's always it always will give

830
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,159
some correcting errors because of the

831
01:12:27,159 --> 01:12:30,010
mode motion this is instant solid it is

832
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:32,800
therefore much more accurate but and

833
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,989
that's the key but it is dependent on

834
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:37,059
the texture or the amount of unique

835
01:12:37,059 --> 01:12:39,849
spots it can identify so again if you do

836
01:12:39,849 --> 01:12:40,749
photogrammetry

837
01:12:40,749 --> 01:12:43,179
on that especially we schedule children

838
01:12:43,179 --> 01:12:45,610
if you take a girl and you scan our

839
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,769
hands maybe leave right now clothing a

840
01:12:47,769 --> 01:12:50,380
girl's skin unlike my skin is super

841
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:53,559
smooth so you would have a hard time

842
01:12:53,559 --> 01:12:56,769
finding unique spots in to get a

843
01:12:56,769 --> 01:12:59,169
high-resolution model out of it by using

844
01:12:59,169 --> 01:13:01,539
the projection method you completely

845
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:04,840
then fix that problem and they don't

846
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,739
have they don't because they use

847
01:13:05,739 --> 01:13:08,040
projection they don't give a

848
01:13:08,040 --> 01:14:32,560
they are using you can each camera has

849
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,360
its own deviation especially if you want

850
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,220
to put the effort in for each camera you

851
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,890
can make a profile to do the correction

852
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:43,900
of that visualization for at44 just the

853
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,340
images taken and then we'll increase

854
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:50,410
your equity but you will find it for

855
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:53,190
product skinny

856
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:58,820
in most public service and deficit

857
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,380
that's where the promise comes with

858
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,260
photogrammetry if you have a smooth

859
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:05,780
surface it's not scalable so Dan you

860
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,600
will more take an Arctic who works like

861
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,100
a Kinect camera and hydrated with

862
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,140
infrared thoughts projecting rivets on

863
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,440
the surface never detected even that

864
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,300
technology is sometimes challenges with

865
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,130
it so if you wanna have something that's

866
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:21,020
really costly than the only accurate

867
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,060
method to scan is those arms that know

868
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,130
exactly where to position is and then I

869
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:27,380
mainly do model touch box so per cupcake

870
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,600
you have to there are many different

871
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,000
methods of scanning you have to figure

872
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,890
out the best guarantee but for typical

873
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:36,230
product scanning for the gravity is not

874
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:40,629
the most ideal because of the services

875
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:46,070
yeah some things you can't spray like if

876
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:48,949
it's a profitable utility spray like

877
01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:52,850
five customers it's kept for museums can

878
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:58,310
I have an ice pack so for dogs actually

879
01:15:58,310 --> 01:16:00,380
we do for you Sparky but we never use to

880
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,790
set up with protectors because

881
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,160
especially the white sculpture with

882
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:08,380
projection on that works extremely well

883
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:29,160
the rhythm a five-hitter six we would

884
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,710
have this xx give me a five mode you get

885
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:40,620
this part of that something is except on

886
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:44,000
your sick later you get that straight

887
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,890
this is now where you take whatever you

888
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:48,090
definitely do put the exclamation mark

889
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:51,920
you can see if you're doing

890
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:37,989
if you

891
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:38,469
yeah

892
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,039
