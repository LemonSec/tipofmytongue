 brains so then you have a date with production step

102
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,800
 in front of it and that's what all the the the flower norm heavier

103
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,139
 affliction did on the rock and the chose this point will colors the look and the

110
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,699
 effect is with you can see the skin tones and the shirt

111

 locker riser interplay thing continuously new slept and seacole there is heavier

116
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:47,720
 it this is my part of the the question why weekend sea with jente

117
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,670
 lucas mission differential things that least weekend seedlings seems movement

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:08,520
 can be demonstrated it's carnival can lesions

121
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,800
 this can or could illusions seem to move is one on the best to the screen

122
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,699
 reach in which you move people s cinenews like this end it seems to move

123
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,480
 like crazy this is because your eyes

124
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,790
 arscene the infant somewhere and the a symptom oef

125
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,000
 and the picos the third look so high contrast this

126
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,150
 the franchise very much at christ I still like a

127
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:41,470
 santing is changing here an that's how the interplay movement another team member

128
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,320
 help for this is because your eyes eat in the poll

129
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,700
 who exactly tings difference when there is a neighboring koller

130
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,730
 so if i could koller next tool black it looks more thats reason and more dock

131
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,590
 nephew powder next to write it looks more best already short

132

 and in the morning it eats these are single there

133
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,270
 still know show this effect die customizer interplay thing

134
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,910
 yes my team kiss you icis interplay thing here seems to save the look trek die er

135
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:22,839
 intersection we also see that bed in letters vision space that arrogant

136
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,100
 intersection you will black a and peer that trick writer in the experience

137
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:34,570
 graphs and then you get thumping that's a there another one that works very

138
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,800
 badly otherwise queen so let's skip this man who is christ so a variation of

00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,900
 this apple is better not and you put cm apple in further light

147
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,930

 a month flight of without the triggers end and then triggers for some time and

261
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,220
 if you this long time your eyes adapt to write to the darkness that is why you

262
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,880
 can see if you enter the dark room you can see hunting and if you wait for

263
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,799
 some time you can see more will eyes adapted i find by this is

 so let's date the moon that forces to do this on this effect

267
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,850
 and the kunz one you thinking about this effects when nuts

268

 is this your 0 net in your eyes is gonna be trained for this effect and i can do this

269
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:50,169
 now type for a mouth the people working for the matrixx language

270
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:55,990
 text editors lost it about a long time that i can see

271
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:03,610
 so normal point in black and white gray and instead of white and pink so it it

272
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:12,539
 is probably en en lang long version of the after effect in illusion

 so give yourself an hour with a still get images outfit and very interesting to see

283
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:35,350
 how those people souls bob met it very hard to look at work like for example of
