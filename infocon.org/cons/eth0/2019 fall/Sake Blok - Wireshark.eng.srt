1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:23,039
yeah yeah yeah okay so still everybody

2
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,320
does certain English people entering the

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,930
room English please

4
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,570
okay those weights doing less no problem

5
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,668
okay I think it's been broadcasted so I

6
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,530
think everybody that wants to be here is

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,719
here and if not then they have some time

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
to join during my talk I didn't prepare

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,579
anything because I didn't know what the

10
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,950
audience would be like so it will be a

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,539
little bit interactive interactive

12
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,079
session and if people don't know me I'm

13
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,730
one of the core developers of Wireshark

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,219
I've been using it for 20 years or so

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,870
and some parts of the code are mine so I

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,850
love to talk about Wireshark and and I

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,930
do give training and so when okay well

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,580
let's do sensation about Wireshark and

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,510
see how it goes I was already starting

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,340
like okay what's the experience level of

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,619
people how many people use it like daily

22
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,820
a couple weekly couple monthly yeah like

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,780
yeah once a year also people yeah so

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,670
people that have never seen more shark

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,110
before okay good there anything you want

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,000
to learn today you want to know what

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,170
were circus okay well that can be done

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,900
okay so basically people have used it

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,020
and in my experience people that use

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,560
Wireshark only use like very tiny bit of

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,829
our shark and can be taught to make

32
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,750
better use of it and that's basically

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,710
what I'm gonna do

34
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,299
so a little bit of you already started

35
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,860
like okay how many how much experience

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,610
do you have

37
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,579
is there anything I already asked that

38
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,799
you want to know that I can focus on

39
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,079
this coming hour or hour and a half

40
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,639
depending on how much interest there is

41
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:18,530
huh yeah yeah there are a lot of options

42
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,990
you know and you know yeah you asked

43
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,670
like how do you drill down from a large

44
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,010
pcap to what you're interested in so

45
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,690
that's something I can focus on as well

46
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,060
so let's focus a little bit on filtering

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,250
using the conversation is the full of

48
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,400
stream profiles columns filter buttons

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,900
stuff like that that might be

50
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,870
interesting for you to look at a little

51
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,750
bit about me well I started yeah I don't

52
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,250
know that's my own company at the moment

53
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,280
for ten years now doing troubleshooting

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,590
and and providing training services so

55
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,140
if you feel the need to contact me on

56
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,540
this one these things you're welcome to

57
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,840
and well let's get this this is what I

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,680
do in training so this one might be nice

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,480
what's wrong in the left picture yeah

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,610
assuming that the scissors are not on

61
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,080
top of the body but in the body then

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,870
that might not be a wise thing to do

63
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,329
some somebody left it there probably

64
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,769
make it on purpose but probably by

65
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,150
accident

66
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,489
anybody can see that that's a problem

67
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:20,930
right so what's the problem the right

68
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:27,590
side what okay no it's actually I don't

69
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,049
know what's calling in in English but

70
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:32,480
it's it's an information of some muscle

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,380
tissue I don't know it was beneath the

72
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,660
picture because it might also be like

73
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,920
something that's broken I don't know

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,180
because I don't I don't have to

75
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,090
knowledge to interpret this picture so

76
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,579
worse using wireshark is like two things

77
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,350
one you need to get the proper picture

78
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,410
like how you filter how do you get the

79
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,880
information on your screen that you need

80
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,190
to interpret what the problem is and the

81
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,810
other part is knowing your protocols

82
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,850
knowing how to CP works knowing how

83
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,200
about our players knowing what these

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,840
Indian esters knowing what HP should

85
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,180
look like if you don't know that it's

86
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,329
very difficult to analyze so there's two

87
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:10,640
things that you need to learn one is how

88
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,290
to make the proper picture how to show

89
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,359
things in Wireshark and the other one is

90
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,010
how to use the protocols well we only

91
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,680
have one hour so I'm not gonna focus on

92
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,550
on TCP you can talk two days about TCP

93
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,850
so I'm not going to do that

94
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,160
I think teaching you how to make a

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,860
better picture in Wireshark how to use

96
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,010
the the functionality of our sir to

97
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,850
focus on the information that you need

98
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,660
is something that can be very useful so

99
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,040
that's all my slides

100
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,390
the rest is Wireshark and that's always

101
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,390
like will it go over I too will go wrong

102
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,690
but so this is I just removed all my

103
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,220
settings because I wanted to show you

104
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,440
how you get word shark when it's out of

105
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,630
the books you get a little screen and if

106
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,420
I open a trace file I had one open

107
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,550
because it was easy but then I remove my

108
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,860
settings in those no the trace was gone

109
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,200
so I need to open it again

110
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,940
let's see training yes please no please

111
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:24,900
yeah yeah that's that's interchangeable

112
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,690
what

113
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,120
yeah people call it this sniffer trace

114
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,920
or a sniffer I always call it the packet

115
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,110
trace and I shorten that to a trace and

116
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,930
then sometimes people get like what does

117
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,370
the traceroute to do no no no I don't

118
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,990
mean the trace route I mean a packet

119
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,480
trace you can call it a pcap which is

120
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
not accurate anymore because I speak up

121
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,340
in G these days different file formats

122
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,680
you haven't done that okay since yeah

123
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,050
peak peak like in in I don't know when

124
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,990
but Steve McCann he made the pcap file

125
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,090
format he was presenting at shark first

126
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,770
a couple of years ago so I met him quite

127
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,280
quite a nice guy and he made the PCAT

128
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,740
format and it was in the time that worse

129
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,260
like nothing so that was how it started

130
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,240
and I think about ten years ago people

131
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,220
started to make a new pick up format we

132
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,980
kept Angie because in pcap you only can

133
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,460
store frames of one link layer type so

134
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,730
either Ethernet or token ring or

135
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,820
wireless but not all of them and so in

136
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,650
pcap Angie format you can store packets

137
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,660
of different link layer types you can

138
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,500
store

139
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,440
name information resolving information

140
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,110
you can store since very shortly you can

141
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,530
store session keys from TLS sessions you

142
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,360
can store it there and so this it's a

143
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,690
very extensible file format so wire

144
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,340
circu speak F and G since 1.8 by default

145
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,440
so you haven't noticed it that it's it's

146
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,430
a different file format but you can

147
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,660
still call it the pcap I do too yeah

148
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,670
let's see what I said workshop traces

149
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:13,800
and there's a nice one yeah so yeah

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,120
peace ask questions because I like

151
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,850
interactive sessions and when something

152
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,860
takes too much time I will ask you to

153
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,990
ask it during dinner again and or after

154
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,400
the session but usually I do like the

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
interaction so when you start Wireshark

156
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,190
and that's what basically all people

157
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,660
know I think in the room is that you

158
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,190
have like a list of packets let me make

159
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,960
this larger you have the list of packets

160
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,050
you have the detailed analysis of wires

161
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,030
are like what every byte in bed means so

162
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,150
if I click on I open this up to

163
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,070
something like the DSP value you can see

164
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,960
in the in the blue here which bytes in

165
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,360
actual packet were responsible for this

166
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,419
piece of information well that's that's

167
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,810
the basic part of our shark and somebody

168
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,790
asks ok what are these colors then

169
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,940
that's just a rule set that says ok if a

170
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,640
packet matches a certain pattern then it

171
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,320
will give a color so it's easily

172
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,100
recognizable we will look into colors

173
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,500
later because you need to have knowledge

174
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,730
about filters but first let's go back to

175
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,590
ok what do you do when you get a picture

176
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,530
packet capture file they can haven't

177
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,880
made yourself because sometimes you get

178
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,710
effective packet capture from somebody

179
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,650
else what are the steps that you do to

180
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,450
start analyzing it you start filtering

181
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,150
ok yeah that's one one way of looking at

182
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,300
things

183
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,320
yeah so basically I hear like filtering

184
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,210
and stuff I tend to do something

185
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,500
different because I want to get a

186
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,270
feeling of what it's in this capture

187
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,130
file and if I start filtering already

188
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,370
then I lose track so what I try to do is

189
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,260
I look at the statistics and then the

190
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,900
capture file properties like if I get a

191
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,760
capture file from a problem that was

192
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,810
there at one o'clock in the afternoon

193
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,750
and and I see here that as the captures

194
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,810
between 11:00 and 11:45 then I know this

195
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,760
is the wrong capture files right I get a

196
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,190
little grasp on what's in the in the

197
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,860
capture file and something else that you

198
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,530
see here and that people a lot of people

199
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,060
don't know but you can put comments in

200
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,070
the capture file that's in the pickup in

201
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,850
G from up its new you can put comments

202
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,190
in so in this file command I put in the

203
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,960
mail that I received when I asked

204
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,250
permission to use this file because this

205
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,300
file was created for cyber Olympics

206
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,480
challenge by the EC Council so I asked

207
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,130
them can I use this file for training so

208
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,720
I put it in there because I want to make

209
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,470
sure that I have to license there so

210
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,760
that's one of the reasons why I look at

211
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,990
the capture file properties because

212
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,360
there might be something like

213
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,230
documentation that people put in there

214
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,140
so that's one of the things the next

215
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,640
thing that are really interested in

216
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,470
these conversations because I want to

217
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,880
know who talked to and if the

218
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,670
conversations are in there if the

219
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,170
systems that I'm interested in are

220
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,840
actually in there in the trace file you

221
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,880
can see that there were communications

222
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,100
at the ethernet layer so some MAC

223
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,330
addresses talk to each other and the

224
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,430
amount of packets that were went back

225
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,340
and forth at the IP layer so there was

226
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,220
quite a few IP conversations going on

227
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,690
but if you scroll through that you can

228
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,820
already see that there's one IP address

229
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,690
that stands out like okay basically

230
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,910
everything communicated with it to five

231
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,530
four five to twelve so that's something

232
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,180
I see in here so maybe the trace was

233
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,470
made on that to four five to twelve I

234
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,960
can see the TCP sessions right okay I

235
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,360
see some FTP based on the ports here

236
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,800
some HTTP HTTPS and there was something

237
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,930
that caught my eye immediately the lead

238
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,090
fourth one three three seven which is

239
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,590
usually like a reverse

240
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,580
or anything so that's since this is a

241
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,740
cyber chat and cyber Olympus ever

242
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,930
Olympics Janus that probably is in

243
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,700
something interesting so that you

244
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,560
immediately gets at kutsher's

245
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,540
it catches your eyes if you look at the

246
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,060
conversation list and some DNS traffic

247
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,700
and if you know your ports a little bit

248
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,100
this is just named resolving on on that

249
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,860
views and some DNS so this might not be

250
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,110
that interesting to look at but this

251
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:38,850
might be interesting so yes you can turn

252
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,440
on name resolution we come to name

253
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,750
resolution later maybe from if not

254
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,160
please ask the question at the end again

255
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,020
because I sometimes lose track of what I

256
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,120
promised so one other way to look at the

257
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
capture files by looking at the protocol

258
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,080
hierarchy which creates like drill down

259
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,490
of all the protocols that are in there

260
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,350
and the the previous version of

261
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,690
Wireshark used to open this up in a come

262
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,330
in a collapsed way which are kind of

263
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,260
like better so if I look at so

264
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,620
everything in Wireshark is a frame in

265
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,120
this in this tray so there's only

266
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,170
easiness frames ipv4 frames and ARP

267
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,640
frames and then ipv4 split up in new UDP

268
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,680
and TCP and then I can drill down even

269
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,550
further into new protocols that are here

270
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,030
so if you know that there's that needs

271
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,830
to be FTP in a trace file you don't see

272
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,240
it it's interesting if you know that

273
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,280
there's not supposed to be FTP in

274
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,470
Australia and there is FTP that's

275
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,870
interesting too so depending on what

276
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,209
you're researching if it's like for

277
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,910
security or for performance issues you

278
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,470
you look at the stress or in a different

279
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,030
way

280
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,050
security people look for things that I

281
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,630
don't expect I look for things that I do

282
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,709
expect so it depends on on on your your

283
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,779
way of using who is using it in a

284
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,620
security way yeah in networking like

285
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,310
performance and ok and application make

286
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,430
so for writers yeah also so there's you

287
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,770
see there's a mixture of people who use

288
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,400
virus or

289
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,740
and and and the way that you use work is

290
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,790
different in each in each use case so

291
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,140
this is another way of looking at the

292
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,970
trace file and and getting some

293
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,910
information out of it like what is there

294
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,070
one thing that's nice about these

295
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,010
overviews is if I filter on an IP this

296
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,700
lets I'm gonna talk about filters later

297
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,460
in a in a minute but let's just assume

298
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,260
that this is a filter that you want to

299
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,180
use three and notice right so I've seen

300
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,810
it before

301
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,460
I just come type that's a different

302
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,900
story there you go

303
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,810
if I go back to the conversation list

304
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,950
and I click on limit to display filter I

305
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,410
can limit this conversation the the list

306
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,140
of all the things that are happening to

307
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,570
Pakistan match the display filter so

308
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,010
that if you are looking for a specific

309
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,350
IP address and you want to know what

310
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,270
that IP address looked for or

311
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,490
communicated with and first filter on

312
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,800
the IP address and then open up the

313
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:28,350
conversation list let's see so what kind

314
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,710
of filters do you use IP address yeah

315
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,130
everybody disappeared s like new filter

316
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,780
on not IP address as well no never

317
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,120
okay one of the things that are that

318
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,060
people ask a lot of questions about is

319
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,060
like this how not equals I should do

320
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,220
correctly and what you can see is that

321
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,610
well the red in the in the dish in the

322
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,140
filter with this this my filter bar

323
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,690
means like it's an invalid filter the

324
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,160
green means it's a valid filter but

325
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,760
wasn't this is yellow mean it says

326
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,550
deprecated or may have been expected

327
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,520
results and that means this filter might

328
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,040
not do what you think it does so to me

329
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,690
if you read it out loud

330
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,170
IP address not equals 192.168 or two for

331
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,630
5.3 you expect that this IPS will not be

332
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,270
visible in your packet list but if I

333
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,880
apply this filter and I go back to the

334
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,570
conversations

335
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:32,360
and I limit it to the display filter you

336
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,620
can see there it is it's still there so

337
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,820
how is it possible

338
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,540
well that's because every packet has two

339
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,400
IP addresses source or the destination

340
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,760
and IP address it's an it's an alias or

341
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,960
yeah for for those two fields and what

342
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,940
the filter literally means is show me

343
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,279
all packets where there's at least one

344
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,320
field with the name IP address that does

345
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,010
not have the value 1 and 2.16 8.24 5.3

346
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,050
so either the source is not equal to

347
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,460
that or the destination is not equal to

348
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,700
that so every packet will match you can

349
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,790
see that here as well in the in the in

350
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,089
the status bar you have like in total 30

351
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,270
3247

352
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:23,750
packets and of those 333 2225 are

353
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,880
displayed that's because some packets

354
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,260
are not IP so they don't have an IP

355
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,630
address so the ARP packets are not

356
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,140
displayed so basically this filter is

357
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,570
that tries yellow because Wireshark

358
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,730
knows that this can be something that

359
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,400
you don't expect so the proper way of

360
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,170
doing that is to put the exclamation

361
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,580
mark there not in front of the IP

362
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,300
address if you do it like that

363
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,580
then if I look at the statistics

364
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:59,029
conversations then I forgot to do that

365
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:00,890
last time as well but you have to trust

366
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,560
me that it was still there so now look

367
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,939
at the conversations and then it's it's

368
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,689
not there but so remember if you want to

369
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:13,429
filter something if you don't if you

370
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:15,109
don't want to see something put it not

371
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,849
in between and in front of it and then

372
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,010
add stuff that you don't want to see

373
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,199
that's the basic rule of thumb to do

374
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,800
this another filter that can be really

375
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,750
used for us to filter on a certain field

376
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,710
like if I filter on HTTP cookie I will

377
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,450
get all the HTTP requests that does that

378
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,560
have an HD cookie but some protocols

379
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,160
like TCP

380
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,490
if a filter on TCP flex that's in you

381
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,580
might expect to see only syn packets

382
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,830
like in a three-way handshake you have

383
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,990
the same cynic egg and so every

384
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,860
conversation starts with the steam pack

385
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,929
a bit as you can see I do see the sin

386
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:58,559
and the sin AK that might be correct if

387
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,929
you do this filter this AK it doesn't

388
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,360
have the syn flag said why is it still

389
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,289
displayed it still has yeah it's still

390
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,720
in India in the TCP header if you look

391
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,210
in this TCP header so there's your

392
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,320
there's your flags

393
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,320
there's still a variable T speed

394
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,049
reflects that's in but just this very

395
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,120
this variable can have two value 1 or 0

396
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,090
depending if it's a syntax or not so for

397
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,740
some fields that are not always present

398
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,200
in a certain protocol like HTTP cookies

399
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,409
and not every HP request has a cookie so

400
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,150
that's the felt that's it filter you can

401
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,460
just say okay show me all fields or

402
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,490
packets that have this field in this

403
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,760
case you need to say I want specifically

404
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,100
that it's 1 because I'm only interested

405
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,090
in the sin and arsenic packets so that's

406
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,710
another way of filtering you can either

407
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,730
use the filter name itself if it's not

408
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,080
always present if it's something that's

409
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,000
always present between have to look for

410
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,460
a specific value then you can do it this

411
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,669
way I'm going really quick because I

412
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:13,289
want to give you as much information in

413
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,480
this hour as possible so if I go too

414
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,500
quick please

415
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,520
slow me down another filter that I

416
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,690
really like is let's do it on a TCP port

417
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:29,370
maybe easier the speed of ports in 84 4

418
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:37,080
3 or maybe and then there's an error

419
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,379
somewhere

420
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:50,190
I said why is there an error it should

421
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,850
work

422
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:58,530
Oh a syntax error I should use that so

423
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,850
this is the filter TCP ports in 84 for

424
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:08,880
three and then 137 : dot dot 139 this

425
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,900
means the TCP port must be either 84 4 3

426
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,630
1 3 7 1 3 8 or 1 3 9 so if you have like

427
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,160
HTTP in your network on 8080 all kinds

428
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,420
of ports that you want to include you

429
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,910
can do it easily this way or if you are

430
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,100
interested in DNS traffic and HP and and

431
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,760
SPS traffic

432
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,940
this would be your filter and all non

433
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,990
DNS or non SSL and on HP traffic will be

434
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,960
filtered away so that's also a very

435
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:51,630
powerful filter to use and let's say I

436
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,170
want to add this to my because I want to

437
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,290
this is a filter that I might use like

438
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,080
extensively so there's a way to add this

439
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,600
as a button and there's this little plus

440
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,290
sign it will create a dialog where you

441
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,450
can enter a name so this is like web

442
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:16,050
traffic for instance and I can make

443
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:21,390
another filter like HP request or HTTP

444
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,720
response apply the filter I don't need

445
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,060
to apply it but I'm just to make sure

446
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,660
that you see what it does now I've see

447
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,560
all the HTTP traffic and another one

448
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,240
actually the other person might not be a

449
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,040
good name for this for the other filter

450
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,470
but let's do this way now can switch

451
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,690
between those two filters by just

452
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,600
clicking on on the button and that's

453
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,240
really something that really makes

454
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,400
things quickly another filter that's

455
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,260
interesting in that regard is this piece

456
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,460
dream equals TCP stream and you say what

457
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,090
what does this do

458
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,780
well basically or the the way that you

459
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,640
should read it is for the currents like

460
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,370
this way this part of the filter the

461
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,620
blue part means look at the current

462
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,250
packet extract the value for the the

463
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,240
fuel TCP stream and then match it to TCP

464
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,430
stream so this means all packets that

465
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,470
belongs to the same piece be stream will

466
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,700
be selected of course this is like a lot

467
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,770
of typing to use this filter you can

468
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,830
also like apply this filter here we're

469
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,540
gonna want to show that in a minute but

470
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,910
I could have done applies filter on this

471
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,090
one I'm gonna show that later but the

472
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,610
beauty of this filter is I can make a

473
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,640
button out of it so if I create a button

474
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,910
and I usually put a hashtag in front of

475
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,570
filters that have dynamic content so pen

476
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,180
stack TCP that means if I now look at my

477
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,780
h3 requests when I think this is an

478
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,880
interesting request I can just click on

479
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,440
this button I get a whole stream of this

480
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,890
HB request this is not so interesting

481
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,690
after all okay I'll go back to all the

482
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,160
HTTP requests and now this one might be

483
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,320
interesting and I'm gonna follow that

484
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,600
stream so this is a very easy way to

485
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,730
navigate through your packets within a

486
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:29,190
trace file one thing that I mentioned is

487
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,300
like okay I could have done it

488
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,310
differently by using apply as filter

489
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,740
what is that have you used

490
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,470
right-click filters before yeah some

491
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,840
people some people don't you can click

492
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,670
on any field in Wireshark like for

493
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,440
instance the

494
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,330
let's say this port number source port

495
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,010
number equals to four seven zero

496
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,140
what if I want to filter all those

497
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,210
packets that have the port number I can

498
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,300
just apply this filter select it and it

499
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,010
will filter on that port and now I'm not

500
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:05,070
interested in for instance I don't want

501
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,540
to see all the packets that have a pull

502
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,190
or I also want to see all the things

503
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,890
that have a push flag I can do apply

504
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,620
this filter and then extend that filter

505
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,080
with these four presents so I'm going to

506
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,300
end select it and it will show me all

507
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,120
the in this case two packets that have

508
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,490
the push flag set and are from source

509
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,190
port so you can extend that by using

510
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,430
your your right mouse button which is

511
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,070
kind of quick as well too to create

512
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:38,580
filters that's something that if you're

513
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,800
looking for information inside a packet

514
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:53,370
like maybe HTTP host contains Amazon it

515
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,160
will mean that it's a case sensitive

516
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,610
search for the word Amazon in the HTTP

517
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,110
host header as you can see there's quite

518
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,080
a few house headers that have Amazon and

519
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,260
if there's a field that that has like

520
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,540
case sensitive information like let's

521
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,310
see if there is a cookie here that might

522
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,010
be interesting too or the user agents

523
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,050
Mozilla has a capital in it if I do SB

524
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:25,530
user agent contains Mozilla they're not

525
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,390
gonna work because Mozilla is written

526
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,580
with a capital and if I don't know how

527
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:35,570
it's been has been capitalized I can

528
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,060
change the value of user agent with the

529
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,630
function lower so we'll take the value

530
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,820
put it to lowercase and then I can make

531
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,470
a comparison to something that's all in

532
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,270
lowercase so in this case everything

533
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,400
that has the text Mozilla in what case

534
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,090
whatsoever will be this way as well but

535
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:58,369
it's also filter that I use a lot

536
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:11,039
yes please undo button think that you

537
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,989
can navigate to the previous packet that

538
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,909
you selected but there's no and there's

539
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:17,519
no filter and do boozing but one way of

540
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,889
doing that is if you press if yours if

541
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:23,159
you have the your cursor in the filter

542
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,649
bar you can press hello

543
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:31,049
ghosts in the machine you can press her

544
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,220
arrow keys and you can browse through

545
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,649
the filters that you have used before so

546
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:36,599
that might it's not really in a little

547
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:39,299
but it gives kind of the functionality

548
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,989
that you can have one do so if I do that

549
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:43,470
again

550
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:49,499
then there's the displaying for one of

551
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:51,570
the things that I changed this is like

552
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,919
filtering what you start doing

553
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,139
straightaway one thing that did I don't

554
00:26:58,139 --> 00:26:59,820
like about the default of our circus is

555
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,229
the way that the screen is being build

556
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:03,359
up if I kept the packet list back with

557
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,009
this cross again the whole packet this

558
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:07,470
light back at least back as you can see

559
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,970
I have a lot of information here and a

560
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,399
lot of white space here if I open this

561
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:12,539
up there's still a lot of white space

562
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,849
here there's still a lot of white space

563
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:18,830
here so what I usually do even if it's a

564
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,210
destination for colleague of mine if I

565
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,499
need to look at the trace there and

566
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:25,320
always change this first so come look at

567
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,259
it this way you change the layout what

568
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:29,820
this does mean I can choose between

569
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,429
these six permutations of the layout the

570
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:34,109
next year I don't I don't only use these

571
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:38,849
two and I kind of don't can't imagine

572
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:41,549
people using these four but then I was

573
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:44,070
in enterprise watch the presentation of

574
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,720
somebody else it said I really like this

575
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,940
one so your your mileage may fry you

576
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,649
mean you know of course you may choose

577
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:54,359
your own organization but this is this

578
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,590
is one that I really like because it

579
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,599
really uses all my real estate on my

580
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,119
screen and now I have less right here

581
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,840
and awesome here but as you can see you

582
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,119
can use this a lot too to change what I

583
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,679
look at

584
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,519
there's a good moment to talk about

585
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:15,069
screen if you change this there's a

586
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:18,939
screen of keyboard shortcut like shift

587
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:25,229
command W and will change the the the

588
00:28:25,229 --> 00:28:30,009
resulting screen in in equal parts also

589
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,569
if you change column width like this and

590
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:35,859
it doesn't show anything nice anymore

591
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:39,099
you can use shift command R and it won't

592
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:42,099
change it back to two away that

593
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,299
everything can be shown on the screen

594
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:45,609
I've got some cheat sheets here for you

595
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:49,119
to take away of all the keyboard

596
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,969
shortcuts so go get them and take a few

597
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:53,409
if you want to distribute them to other

598
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:59,589
people feel free to take some some some

599
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:02,259
keyboard shortcuts are really really

600
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:06,009
handy like for instance if I want to

601
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:07,449
change the time that's been displayed

602
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:09,999
here now it's second since beginning of

603
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,399
capture so it starts at zero and then it

604
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,069
just adds up to how long the capture

605
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:18,159
takes if I want to use if you want to

606
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,919
show that in in wall clock time I can

607
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:22,779
use the time display format and a few

608
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:25,659
and then say time of day this you can

609
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:28,239
see there's also a shortcut this is the

610
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:30,729
wind the Macintosh or cut command option

611
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:35,079
two in Windows it's command or sorry no

612
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,039
command control out to you you will see

613
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,319
the shortcuts here and there are also on

614
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,749
the teacher so if I do it like this it

615
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:48,069
takes like one searching to know three

616
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:50,589
clicks and you see you just want to look

617
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:58,649
at it well so if I do it like this one

618
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:01,689
and I already forgot I need to read my

619
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:04,959
eye but seats is more often it's only

620
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:08,409
two so it's two or four and you can

621
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:11,859
switch with it real easy and you really

622
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:13,149
need to get it into your system you see

623
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:15,399
that I use water shock every day and I

624
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:16,719
still don't have those in our system

625
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:22,250
because it yeah okay

626
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:27,020
so every one of the things that that I

627
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,970
did this well there's a lot of missing

628
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,220
but one of the fields that should be in

629
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,530
the default columns of wire sir what

630
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,930
what what fields are you missing in this

631
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,420
display like you see like the number of

632
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,720
the packet time source destination

633
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,160
protocol length and info what kind of

634
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,810
fields do you think should be should be

635
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,510
edit here as well

636
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,040
source for destination port if you're if

637
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,800
you're analyzing the TCP and UDP packets

638
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,950
that might be something interesting

639
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,290
something else time since previous

640
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,500
packet yeah I think all the and if

641
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,450
you're doing performance analysis and

642
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,830
and then timing is really important so

643
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,240
adding a timed field to to show the

644
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,500
difference between the packets is

645
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,810
something that I think should be default

646
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,690
but it's a good example to be sure to

647
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,290
show to edit so one way of doing it is

648
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,190
going to the the preferences so you have

649
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,230
edit preferences on the windows or file

650
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,840
in Linux and file Varsha preferences on

651
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,420
the Mac and you can go to the columns

652
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,550
you can add a column and now we're going

653
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,380
to run into a nice little bug

654
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,720
if I add a column Delta and I choose

655
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,300
from the predefined fields I choose the

656
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,000
other time displayed the Delta time is

657
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,980
like the Delta time in the capture file

658
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,990
so whatever it's displayed if you're

659
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,060
still sure that the Delta as it was in

660
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,310
the file but I'm of course interested in

661
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,110
how its shown on the screen so I want to

662
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,810
do the other time displayed and if I

663
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,690
move this column now to the plate the

664
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,820
place where I want it the last column

665
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,720
will we delete it

666
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,820
that's a book in this this version so

667
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,740
that needs to be fixed not sure if it's

668
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,220
there in Windows or Linux even but at

669
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,600
least on the Mac it's there so I need to

670
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,300
add re s the info column by hand like

671
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,350
the first time we're gonna have did I

672
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,350
delete something that's actually bug off

673
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,590
by one error probably then I have this

674
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:28,460
Delta column everything that that you

675
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,830
change in the the way Wireshark is

676
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:35,340
displayed is by default saved in your

677
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,570
Tifa profile and you can make different

678
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,690
profiles for things I'm gonna talk about

679
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,980
that later but this is this is a delta

680
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,990
column that that I created by hand but

681
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,780
you can also add columns like if I have

682
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,060
the IP TTL if that's something that's

683
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,880
interesting for your analysis you can

684
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,870
open up your IP TTL you can also add a

685
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:05,550
column by using applies column so we had

686
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,260
applied filter and we have now applied

687
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,270
column where we can just say I want to

688
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,930
have this TTL field in the columns and

689
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:15,570
if I think it's more appropriate to do

690
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,160
it here I can just move them around I

691
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,720
can sort on it it takes a while come on

692
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,840
not that difficult

693
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,640
I can put it in the middle if I want

694
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,090
align Center and you can you can just

695
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,860
one thing if you already saw here if I

696
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,850
scroll down you know let's go to the

697
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,610
last packet you see some some dots here

698
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,560
like it can't display it in the width of

699
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,660
the of the field that's where you have

700
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,180
this this button for and it was the same

701
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,140
as the shift control R it will resize

702
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,590
all the packets so every column has the

703
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,320
full information physical so that's

704
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,570
something that really is handy if you

705
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,420
see some some dots shift ctrl R and and

706
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:09,870
and it's fixed for you so yeah let's

707
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,540
move onto to profiles because you see

708
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,540
only edit editing the layout you saw me

709
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,969
editing the Delta of the columns and you

710
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,489
saw me editing some filter buttons you

711
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:23,400
can and that's more stuff but everything

712
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,840
that's being saved is in the in the

713
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,710
default profile as you can see I've got

714
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,120
a lot of profiles I get a lot of

715
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,400
training and I have some some

716
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,370
interesting and useful profiles like

717
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,170
it's very quickly to switch between

718
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,120
filters by using each filter buttons

719
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,790
it's very easy to switch between ways of

720
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,790
analyzing and then analyzing by choosing

721
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,159
a different profile so if I good for

722
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:47,520
instance

723
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,149
the TCP profile that I made on you you

724
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:52,820
see that changed immediately into a

725
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,880
screen where I have by Matisse P stream

726
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,990
number I have a TCP Flags my windows

727
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,720
size about sim flights my sequence

728
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,200
numbers etc actually the screen is the

729
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,360
the resolution is the screen is not that

730
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,110
that big because it's only 1280 and I

731
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:17,970
have nine 1918 my screen of course of

732
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:24,930
1920 I wish there was a laptop like this

733
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,760
right because I always have like all the

734
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,520
columns that I need and that's that's

735
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,080
because if I scroll through these

736
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,030
packets you can also see that the colors

737
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,560
have changed I'm gonna talk about colors

738
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,350
later if I scroll through these packets

739
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,360
some things to stick out because they're

740
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,160
there in the packet list if I need to

741
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,750
look into here to see the MAC addresses

742
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,340
for instance because they're not showing

743
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,770
at the moment I need to open this up

744
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,330
look at the MAC addresses then click on

745
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,760
another packet look at the MAC addresses

746
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,110
so everything that's in actually the

747
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,290
mega-doses are there only for our

748
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,650
packets of course but if you are

749
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,710
analyzing something put as many columns

750
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,410
on the screen that you can have that are

751
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,760
interested for the analysis that you're

752
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,770
doing and then it gets really

753
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,150
interesting if you make different

754
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,470
profiles for different troubleshooting

755
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,320
tasks so if you troubleshooting HTTP put

756
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,750
the host header who's cooking

757
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,910
information or who does current

758
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,920
information in in a column if you're

759
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,750
analyzing TCP and you need to look at

760
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,040
the sequence numbers put the sequence

761
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,410
numbers in and that's where using

762
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,630
profiles really can can make an

763
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,550
advantage into quickly getting to the

764
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,040
stuff that you need as you can see I

765
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,430
have all kinds of filter buttons now for

766
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,990
analyzing TCP give me all the sin fin

767
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,180
and reset packets give me all the same

768
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,120
packets give me all the retransmissions

769
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:51,420
or maybe packets where there's a 0/0

770
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,250
window condition that's and if I there's

771
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,170
no safe traffic in this descriptor file

772
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,800
but if I

773
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,270
open my ship profile there wasn't any

774
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:11,180
ship perfect here I would still if I

775
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,630
open it maybe there's a I think there's

776
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:22,870
a voice call right now you see like OID

777
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:26,600
method for registering and and and the

778
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,940
result code the user agent or the server

779
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,320
and I have like okay when I have all the

780
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,630
invites all the call calls from this

781
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,760
call I want to have all the signaling

782
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,040
and the RTP and you get all the

783
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,560
signaling and the RTP within one button

784
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,940
instead of having to filter that

785
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,570
yourself so basically if you use

786
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,470
Wireshark quite a lot then it's it's

787
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,120
very interesting to build some profiles

788
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,970
that match your your way of working to

789
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,970
and the proper time to do that because I

790
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,430
am a teacher so I teach seven and then

791
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,940
don't do it myself what I know this is

792
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,130
if you analyze something you you don't

793
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,320
have the time to you just want to fix

794
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,940
your stuff so you that's not the time to

795
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,330
do it

796
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,080
but once that has been done then take 15

797
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,520
minutes to see okay what did I do in

798
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,560
this case and now the problem is now

799
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,690
solved so I have some time now I create

800
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,250
a profile then that will help me the

801
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,050
next time when I need to analyze such a

802
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,450
problem so that might be a good workflow

803
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,930
like every time you solve something

804
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,760
yeah adjust your profiles to make the

805
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,480
next time more and more easy Nancy yeah

806
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,720
question

807
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,459
good question

808
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,109
yeah can you can you capture forever and

809
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:55,130
what what will happen if you do my rule

810
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,579
of thumb is like 50 to 100 megabytes of

811
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:02,779
pcap traffic is doable then your filters

812
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:05,390
will be a little bit slow depending on

813
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,430
what in the traffic but it will be

814
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,979
doable if you load the trades for 500

815
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:12,799
megabytes or one gigabyte then you need

816
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:15,229
a very beefy laptop to to be able to

817
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:19,849
work with it it's not about time it's

818
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:21,229
about the amount of packets that are in

819
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:23,439
there

820
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:32,180
that depends on on your network how much

821
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,410
happens on your network so what I

822
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,239
usually do when I make a capture file

823
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,900
let's go to the capture options if I

824
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,029
want to capture on my Wi-Fi interface I

825
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:43,430
have here the output options if you fill

826
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,640
in the file a test and then I can say

827
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,069
create a new file after for instance 100

828
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:55,400
megabytes and it could have been easier

829
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,549
like this 100 megabytes and then I say I

830
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:05,719
want to keep like 10 files and that

831
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:08,929
means it will start a file create a new

832
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:11,029
one after 100 megabytes create a new one

833
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:12,499
and then after 10 files it will delete

834
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:14,660
the first one and created the next one

835
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,339
and that you can capture like this

836
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:19,209
forever until the problem occurs and

837
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,559
then you don't know how long each

838
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,719
capture file will be but at least you

839
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:26,059
know you this is not filling up so

840
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:32,739
that's that's the way I do that yeah

841
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:42,210
no no not with him Wireshark no of

842
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,710
course you can do some scripting at post

843
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,660
process your files or if there's a

844
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,130
trigger somewhere and then just kill

845
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,870
Wireshark but that needs to be external

846
00:40:48,870 --> 00:41:09,240
loading bar sir yes yep no you can use

847
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:18,480
TCP dump that's with - capital C now hon

848
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,580
that means create a new file every

849
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,520
hundred megabytes and then recent

850
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,470
versions of TCP dump I think the last

851
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,080
two three years ago or five maybe five

852
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,910
years ago already there there's that

853
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,120
capital W which means if I do ten files

854
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,090
it will rotate over those ten files and

855
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,340
I think there's also if you don't want

856
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,200
to do a time base there's capital G and

857
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,470
then for instance 3604 for one hour

858
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,470
captures so you can do that with t

859
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:53,060
speed-up - okay

860
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,900
by default every packet that's on on the

861
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,160
interface that you capture from is

862
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,550
captured so if you want to restrict it

863
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,960
to something you can use a capture

864
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,350
filter as you can see here in the in the

865
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,320
input I can enter a capture filter so if

866
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,580
you're only interested in in that's a

867
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,260
display filter if I'm only interested in

868
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:29,080
0 0 1 I can put in a filter like this I

869
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,490
tend to not use to capture filters

870
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,560
because when I'm analyzing something I

871
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,830
don't know what I'm analyzing so I kind

872
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,660
of tend to you to capture everything and

873
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,880
then filter afterwards by display filter

874
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,490
if that's too much to save to disk then

875
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,540
I'd tend to look at ok which house are

876
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,250
not interesting and communicating a lot

877
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,400
and then I'd say okay if this 1000 does

878
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,250
one is is watching at Netflix I can just

879
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,810
say ok I don't want to have that in my

880
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,630
trace and I can put some host in there

881
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,640
that I'm not interested in because

882
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,800
sometimes your ICP packets or your are

883
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,290
packets or your DNS packets we turn out

884
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,170
in your filter if you do only house

885
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,060
10.00 1 are the ones that gives you the

886
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:18,890
clue why things are going wrong ok what

887
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,290
do I do you mean do you know what

888
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:25,250
promiscuous mode means no well in real

889
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,390
life that's something different but in

890
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,800
Wireshark it's normally your your

891
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,660
Ethernet card it will only listen to

892
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,250
packets that are destined for your own

893
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,220
MAC address or the broadcast address or

894
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,900
the multicast addresses that it has

895
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,440
subscribed to so if you put water shark

896
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,600
if you if you try to capture on a spend

897
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,430
part of a switch you copy traffic from

898
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,020
one port to another port or one Filan to

899
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,960
one port then those packets don't have

900
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,880
your MAC address so by default those

901
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,350
packets will be dropped by your network

902
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,240
card and that's why you need to put on

903
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,690
and by default it's enabled promiscuous

904
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,970
mode that means your network card will

905
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,830
listen to anything and they will just

906
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,350
pass it through so well if you don't if

907
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,570
you use a spam porting you don't see the

908
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,710
things that you're interested in you

909
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,170
might want

910
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,519
check if your if your promise we

911
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:21,680
smartest turn on let's see interesting

912
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:29,819
you're a software developer yeah for the

913
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:31,829
BPF filters actually it's also built by

914
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:34,140
Steve McCann it's it's a little virtual

915
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,710
machining inside your kernel and why is

916
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,150
it a little virtual machine inside your

917
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,559
corner because if you want to do capture

918
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:42,299
filtering it usually means they can have

919
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:46,380
a lot of traffic and you your system is

920
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,390
overloaded by the amount of stuff you

921
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,220
want something that can filter the

922
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,019
packets without moving them to user

923
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:53,730
space so there's a little virtual

924
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,380
machine inside your kernel and this is

925
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,200
the language of your virtual machine so

926
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,049
in this case load two bytes at position

927
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:03,960
12 which is the ether type compare it to

928
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,279
the ether type of IP with 0 X 800 then

929
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:12,510
if it is if it isn't IP jump to 6 which

930
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,089
means I'm gonna look at ARP so let's

931
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:20,339
make it a little easier IP host that's

932
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,890
an easier filter so look if it's IP if

933
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,619
it's not IP go to 7 which means I'm done

934
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:28,440
don't capture if it is IP I need to

935
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,970
check the IP address I'm look at the

936
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,180
source address if it's 1000 to 1 then

937
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,940
I'm done I can capture it if it's not I

938
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,049
need to look at the destination address

939
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:42,890
etc oh and you can make it very

940
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:49,049
difficult if you do TCP or 80 it gets a

941
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:52,710
lot more difficult because now you see

942
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,900
that it needs to compensate for for

943
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,700
headers didn't have a very variable

944
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,650
width so it needs to get the the length

945
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,960
of the IP header calculate that and then

946
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,519
move out for that and then see in the

947
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:05,789
TCP header where port 80 so it can get

948
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:09,119
really complicated but at least you have

949
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,130
a way of if your filter doesn't do what

950
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,440
you think it needs to do then you can

951
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,940
check ok what does the filter actually

952
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,190
do in the kernel and then maybe you need

953
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,500
to rewrite your filter if you ever ever

954
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,970
have problems I've got this strange

955
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,950
fetish that I like kept a filter

956
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,000
building

957
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,290
if you ever have a problem with the

958
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,300
capture filter feel free to email me and

959
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,660
I'll try to help okay so that's

960
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:36,180
capturing so we covered Oh colors we

961
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,670
didn't cover colors yet you can see in

962
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,000
this profile where where there's voice

963
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,010
traffic has a different color scheme

964
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:48,660
than we had in in a default also if I go

965
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:53,250
back to the TCP colors and I filter up

966
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,250
TCP for in for a moment

967
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,650
which is not missed ratio okay go to the

968
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,160
last one

969
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,350
you can see that there are different

970
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,780
colors here as well colors are also

971
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,510
saved in your profile and you can change

972
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,940
the color the way colors are using by

973
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,560
going to the coloring rules in this case

974
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,050
I deleted all the standard stuff that

975
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,730
I'm not interested in and I created some

976
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,650
some new filters for myself and it's

977
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,750
basically like a firewall rule base it

978
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,790
goes to the first coloring rule if it

979
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,500
matches it covers the colorized the

980
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,780
packet and it's done if it doesn't mess

981
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,350
it goes to the next etc until it finds a

982
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:44,230
matching filter so in this case oh my

983
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,710
PCP reset flat packets will have the red

984
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,870
color or my sin will have two blue color

985
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,330
cynics will have sorry the green color

986
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,770
all the cynics will have the green color

987
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,100
with blue text in it my fin packets will

988
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,070
have blue etc and of course if I change

989
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:03,970
you to the other profile let me go back

990
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:05,830
to the coloring rules and that's giving

991
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:10,510
some time yeah there you have a totally

992
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,360
different set of rules

993
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,520
one thing that that you see here it's

994
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,730
called following it means I stand out is

995
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,400
I usually have like a no colander like a

996
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,760
very strong color that I can enable by

997
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,760
clicking here and I can type in a filter

998
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,840
like something that I want to have

999
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:35,320
really focus on so if I do it like the

1000
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:42,550
nest traffic this in this case and you

1001
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,200
can quickly see I can scroll through

1002
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,290
30,000 packets like this in a few

1003
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,480
seconds and you already get an get a

1004
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,560
know few of where the nest packets are

1005
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,480
you can in this right side you might

1006
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,420
have not seen this before or not took a

1007
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,580
real close look at it this is actually a

1008
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,590
preview of what's coming so this is the

1009
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:05,380
whole capture file and or not a whole

1010
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,450
capture file it's one pixel per per

1011
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,640
packet and if you scroll down you will

1012
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,130
see like these packets correspond to

1013
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,590
these and if I scroll down I will see

1014
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,290
these coming by these will come by if I

1015
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,750
scroll down more and so it's like a

1016
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,210
preview of what's coming

1017
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,010
just if you change your background color

1018
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:27,370
to something that stands out in like

1019
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,350
this this purple one or the magenta one

1020
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,860
who wasn't a color comfort presentation

1021
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,300
before here it's a lie that's something

1022
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:37,630
different

1023
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,280
so that you can you can use that to make

1024
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,680
things stand out and something sometimes

1025
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,560
also do is create like a white

1026
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,870
background with a very light gray text

1027
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,200
to make things disappear so do what I

1028
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,600
see them but I don't want to like having

1029
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,180
a really subdued so I can then use a

1030
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:03,730
gray like if I let's create another one

1031
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,010
but the default is not enabled which I

1032
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:10,590
think it's book like this is grayed out

1033
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,220
and then I say I will

1034
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:22,900
I want all tcp ports in 84 4 3 I don't

1035
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,250
want to see that and then I create a

1036
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:34,440
foreground color and I choose like very

1037
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:42,100
light gray like there and the displacer

1038
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,400
just gone okay tcp goes i think it's

1039
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,870
also a book people I want to help in

1040
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:52,320
fixing bugs if you can program C then

1041
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:58,480
you can help out ok there it is you see

1042
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,800
it's already great out here

1043
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:07,360
and now all the non non for alien 403

1044
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,420
traffic stands out all the DNS traffic

1045
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,760
stands out so this is a way you can help

1046
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,490
yourself in finally the things that are

1047
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,980
interesting if a certain cookie is

1048
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,230
interesting or a certain port or

1049
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,020
whatever make a make a really bright

1050
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:28,990
filter for it in our color for it let's

1051
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:32,590
see what did I didn't I cover there's a

1052
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,160
lot of things that Indian government

1053
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,349
not any questions so far things that I

1054
00:51:39,349 --> 00:52:00,700
mean yeah yes yeah so let's say I found

1055
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,799
three let's say this is an interesting

1056
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:08,420
house did I want to look at more

1057
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,160
specifically if it's a really large file

1058
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,990
every sorry I wonder if it's a fits in a

1059
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,660
different file then it's actually not

1060
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,329
safe as you might expect it's actually

1061
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:20,869
export specified packets and then you

1062
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:26,450
can create a new file like them and if I

1063
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:34,700
open that file then pcap angie and i

1064
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,690
remove the filter and those statistics

1065
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,309
conversations you can see that every

1066
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:42,700
conversation it's actually from this

1067
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:52,880
from the three okay I showed you how to

1068
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,910
use Matt good point right now the right

1069
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,789
mouse click on on profile here and then

1070
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:04,549
create new or say manage profiles if you

1071
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:06,589
want a copy one let's say I want to copy

1072
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:08,690
the TCP one that I already have I can

1073
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,119
press the copy button and create a new

1074
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,510
copy and then you can change it one

1075
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:17,240
other way is to go to few and then

1076
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,710
conversation let's see where the

1077
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:23,529
concrete concrete profiles and I edit

1078
00:53:23,529 --> 00:53:31,880
helps there is one guy that has like a

1079
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,510
whole list of profiles I can't remember

1080
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:38,089
what its website is but there there are

1081
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,799
some profiles if you look for worship

1082
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,420
profiles online you can find some

1083
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,910
profiles what I do suggest is that you

1084
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:47,210
look at those profiles using bit will

1085
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:48,470
change them to your own like

1086
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,450
because everybody works in a different

1087
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,609
way so please learn from from what I'm

1088
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:55,490
doing this is not this is my way of

1089
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,170
course it should be your way but you

1090
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:59,329
probably have a better way for yourself

1091
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:05,900
so please use your own way no but you

1092
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,660
can export it by going to about

1093
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:13,400
Wireshark that's not where shark there

1094
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,490
we go about very shark and then if you

1095
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:18,410
go to folders it will show you where

1096
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,569
your personal communication folder is if

1097
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:23,660
I double click that it opens in in file

1098
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,329
explorer or in finder and then there's a

1099
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,670
folder called profiles and here you see

1100
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,140
all those profiles there's just

1101
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,900
directories on your on your disk so you

1102
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,640
can just copy it zip it and send it to

1103
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,369
somewhere else there's actually in I

1104
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:39,680
think it's in 3.2 there will be an

1105
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,170
import for that you can import a profile

1106
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:45,020
we don't have an export yet but probably

1107
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,780
will appear somewhere along the lines as

1108
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:54,260
well yeah ok let's go back to the trace

1109
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,290
so one thing somebody said like follow

1110
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:01,220
stream who uses follow stream who

1111
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,690
doesn't use follow stream and what the

1112
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:06,170
hell is it good it's almost nice to be

1113
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,270
able to show something let's go back to

1114
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:15,770
my huh yeah falling yeah so if this is a

1115
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,720
trace where where I thought there's

1116
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,369
something interesting and in one three

1117
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:20,599
six seven because that's not a normal

1118
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:23,060
port it's usually like a backdoor so

1119
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,890
well if I want to know what what

1120
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:26,690
happened to not on that stream what was

1121
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,579
the content of that stream I can use the

1122
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:31,609
follow TCP stream so you can right mouse

1123
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:34,940
click follow and because this is TCP you

1124
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,980
can only select TCP stream if it's UDP

1125
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,980
events like European if it's as a cell

1126
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,500
and you did SSL decryption you can do

1127
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,099
till a stream and so in this case I'm

1128
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:48,920
gonna do follow TCP stream and now you

1129
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,780
can see that this is actually a reefer

1130
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,420
shell because you see that as you can

1131
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,540
see like there's a interactive session

1132
00:55:55,540 --> 00:56:01,130
in here the colors are like the blue is

1133
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,070
from the client

1134
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:03,690
to the server which means that the one

1135
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,180
that's in it initiates the session

1136
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,130
that's the client could be a server of

1137
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,540
course doing that but the one that

1138
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,450
initiates the TCP session is in blue and

1139
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,200
the other one is in red and then you can

1140
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,840
select one part of the conversation one

1141
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,590
flow by changing it so if I do it like

1142
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:23,820
this I can see all the commands that

1143
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,910
were typed in and all the output will be

1144
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:32,100
in the other one and of course this one

1145
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,530
of course you can saved it in a new file

1146
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:38,550
if you're interested in building a

1147
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:44,790
report out of this nothing another full

1148
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,530
of stream flow stream just shows the

1149
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,090
content without any timing you lose that

1150
00:56:48,090 --> 00:57:03,210
information yeah yes not not by default

1151
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,880
because of course like Wireshark gets it

1152
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,410
from the from the net you know close to

1153
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,420
the network card so so only your browser

1154
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,970
knows these encrypted stuff but your

1155
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,070
browser can export the TLS session keys

1156
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:16,050
and wire second I read the TLS session

1157
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:19,260
keys and then you can decrypt traffic is

1158
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:25,350
that something you want to see okay let

1159
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:29,760
me get a sip of water done because this

1160
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,280
is something that live demos also it's

1161
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,260
always like interesting yeah that's why

1162
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,400
it's interesting so if I am going to use

1163
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,930
Chrome I could now I did it wrong

1164
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,430
because I started chrome already and you

1165
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,350
need to set an environment variable so

1166
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:49,320
I'm going to quit chrome and I'm gonna

1167
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:59,910
export let's do it here so you need to

1168
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,160
set an expert and environments for a

1169
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:08,510
variable and it's a SSL key lock file

1170
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:12,920
and I'm gonna do it like okay

1171
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:20,630
so now whatever I start from this shell

1172
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,450
will be using this key lock file so

1173
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:30,140
applications google chrome contents and

1174
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:36,770
then it's go from you can make like a

1175
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:39,220
shortcut for this but i don't have that

1176
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,440
so if i open this up now everything that

1177
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,260
i will look up in chrome will create as

1178
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,830
files right from I don't know WW you

1179
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,890
don't know it will switch to 80s and if

1180
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,470
I look at this trash follow I need to

1181
00:58:54,470 --> 00:59:04,640
have another session here yeah there's

1182
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,410
the it's been there for a couple of

1183
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:10,250
years actually in Firefox it it it works

1184
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,170
as well but then there were a couple of

1185
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:13,460
versions that it didn't work and the

1186
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,520
fire floor except as out now it works

1187
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,130
again but they were like in between like

1188
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,200
couple versions I didn't have it enabled

1189
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:43,550
so let's go let's see traces were the

1190
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:48,700
SSL keys are there and if I tell that

1191
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:56,120
keys food is enabled okay how much time

1192
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,120
do you want I can stop now or can let's

1193
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,160
let not now okay there's a cliffhanger

1194
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,140
so let's give it like 10 minutes or so

1195
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:10,700
okay so let's tell this and go to

1196
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,170
website and you can see that it is

1197
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:15,850
growing let's see

1198
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,270
so I go like I go there you see all the

1199
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:27,850
the session Keys you have like the

1200
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:29,740
private key of the server and you have

1201
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,090
session keys like the private key is

1202
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:33,370
only used depending on what kind of

1203
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:37,420
Feliz probe settings you use but the

1204
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,190
session the session key is actually an

1205
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,600
FM arrow key just for that specific

1206
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,360
session and those are created in this

1207
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,160
file so I can decrypt everything that I

1208
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,110
capture at the moment so if I'm gonna

1209
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,770
capture here get your options on the

1210
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:55,420
Wi-Fi interface let's beat this one this

1211
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:00,160
I don't wanna name either okay so let's

1212
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,620
start a capture and let's go to where

1213
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,460
anybody wants to fill in their bank

1214
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:12,520
details now know why not so let's go to

1215
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:21,520
oh yeah yeah yeah of course

1216
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,730
let's go to the rav bank for instance go

1217
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:26,740
to in doha I'm not gonna login but let's

1218
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:31,140
say I'm using 1 2 3 4 5 6 - I don't know

1219
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,030
this doesn't work but there's already

1220
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,650
packets from the rival Bank right so if

1221
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,890
I'm gonna stop this and now I'm gonna

1222
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:44,740
change my profile for TLS since were

1223
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,840
like three we call it TLS instead of SSL

1224
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,750
which is more correct because shouldn't

1225
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:52,120
be used anymore if it is used anywhere

1226
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:56,290
and then you should let's let them in

1227
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:58,000
those preferences so let's open the

1228
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,760
protocol preferences in the preferences

1229
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,770
for TLS there's a field called the

1230
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:05,860
premaster secret lock a file name and if

1231
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:09,670
I point that to this SSO keys that I

1232
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:13,810
just created some decryption will happen

1233
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:16,390
so let's see if they are still s traffic

1234
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:24,220
and there is and there is my HTTP as

1235
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:29,500
within TLS there's HTTP if I do HTTP dot

1236
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,940
house contains Rabobank

1237
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,460
if all goes well they should be like the

1238
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,020
rabbim traffic that was just encrypted

1239
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:50,130
not anymore in an RSA key exchange the

1240
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,690
the session key is encrypted with the

1241
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:54,580
public key from a certificate and then

1242
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,040
sent to the server by the client so if

1243
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,780
you have the private key you can decrypt

1244
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,510
that session key transfer but with

1245
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:05,280
defeat almond key exchange the the

1246
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,960
exchange of the key the session key is

1247
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,020
not based on the private key anymore so

1248
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,610
in that case you need either endpoint

1249
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,380
either the client or the server to lock

1250
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,580
those keys and then you can do

1251
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:20,640
decryption so I don't know if any well

1252
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,980
you can change the open SSL library to

1253
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,630
lock those keys so if you have a server

1254
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:27,820
that that uses open SSL you can have

1255
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:31,600
that lock keys but not many it will

1256
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,100
become a problem so that more and more

1257
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,020
service world will be able to log

1258
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,450
session keys for debugging but at the

1259
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,800
moment it's just on the client side that

1260
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:45,070
you can do it yeah ok it all went very

1261
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:47,230
quickly but I wanted to show you some

1262
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,150
interesting parts of our psyche that I

1263
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,980
think should be used and a lot of people

1264
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,510
don't use so any more questions for now

1265
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,970
before dinner

1266
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,680
feel free to ask me any questions during

1267
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:10,480
this weekend who Dimitri ok he's here

1268
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,160
now he said eat right he's playing with

1269
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:22,030
lasers yeah yeah I think I could I'm

1270
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:26,400
gonna talk to Dimitri about it yeah yeah

1271
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:36,000
okay so a protocol this sector it's not

1272
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,070
yeah depends on where you come from of

1273
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,630
course if you have no programming

1274
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:41,700
experience and it's really hard but if

1275
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,470
you know programming there's quite a

1276
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:48,030
good developer guide there's the source

1277
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,370
code I think it's pretty readable so

1278
01:04:50,370 --> 01:05:00,960
it's not no there's no no there is a

1279
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,240
generic protocol ii think you can make

1280
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,760
like a config file like these fill this

1281
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,590
is two bytes and it needs to be

1282
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:09,750
interpreted this way i haven't used that

1283
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,240
but it's available somewhere you can

1284
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,710
also write them sorry in lua script so

1285
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,820
it's already canceled a little more

1286
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,670
complicated so it's not really easy like

1287
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:24,090
okay i'm gonna point at this these bytes

1288
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,510
and now every time you see these bytes

1289
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:30,120
at this position we relating to THP it

1290
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,980
should be this that know that that's not

1291
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,850
there would be an interesting option for

1292
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,350
