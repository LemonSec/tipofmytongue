1
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,019
you're determined to leave me in the

2
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,699
dark aren't you right

3
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,989
Awesome's

4
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,830
nope which one was it

5
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,220
how the crap oh yeah present last one

6
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,070
woohoo is this everybody is that

7
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,540
everybody is anybody else to come do you

8
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,390
think or awesomes okay um now right this

9
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,210
talk that too loud we could levels good

10
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,340
okay and though this talk is some

11
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,860
talking i gave well there's two parts to

12
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,040
this talk the first part is a talk I

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,369
gave to or choke in Hampton bridge in

14
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,729
the UK open source hardware use group so

15
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,340
a group of people very much like

16
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,350
yourselves very much hardware hackers

17
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,039
but probably not from the sort of bad

18
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,200
community some of the Mac space remember

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,070
some of the MER industry people and so

20
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,780
it's a slightly different audience so

21
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,390
some of the things you will already know

22
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,160
the second part is I'm all to talk about

23
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,300
something else on the same subject okay

24
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,070
saddles saving your electronic

25
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,330
conference badge from a life on the

26
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,320
shelf because writing for hackaday sorry

27
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,910
I should introduce myself in there you

28
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,200
probably all know who I am my name's

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,790
Jenny list I write from hackaday

30
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,130
I'm also a member of a tax base and MK

31
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,430
makerspace in the UK writing for

32
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,880
hackaday

33
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,650
I see a lot of badges obviously we cover

34
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,320
badge life to a great extent it's one of

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,940
the more exciting things that we write

36
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,400
about and trouble is you see a lot of

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,830
badges which were really cool when they

38
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,280
came out but aren't really much use down

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,630
there nice to look at but nobody else

40
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,640
and you come to the point where you

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,190
realize that it's it's a shame so this

42
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,750
is sort of I guess a personal manifesto

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,239
now this is the bit where you probably

44
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,340
know this stuff um quick introduction to

45
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,160
what his badge life most of you will

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,510
know this because you're part of this

47
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,060
scene rather than part of Oscar but this

48
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,959
slide is from them

49
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,930
obviously electronic conference badge is

50
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,820
it get one when you come to a conference

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
and it's an electronic showcase of

52
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,600
possible that's the first ever

53
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,280
electronic conference bad you know

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,600
community from DEFCON 14 in 2006 it's

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,310
quite simple it's a difficult logo with

56
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,160
LEDs for eyes I believe they had

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,590
different colors for different types of

58
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,190
levels like they normally do but that's

59
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,800
the first of the art now this is very

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,630
important that last point at the bottom

61
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,270
I don't know he'll you not see - life

62
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,420
but you may see there's a demo with it

63
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,100
made you see if cool stuff I see there's

64
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,230
our community's art form there are

65
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,640
plenty of people in our community who do

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,010
art but normally they do a hockey

67
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,010
version of other people's art you know

68
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,418
art Lee you'll find from other people

69
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,850
right this is the art form that is

70
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,919
evolved within our community and these

71
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,640
are of our community and these leads

72
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,350
onto what I'm talking about later I feel

73
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,700
it's important that we recognize that

74
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,160
and celebrate it as an art form so this

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,540
is just a quick introduction you get

76
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,580
again you probably already know this the

77
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,560
event birch is the kind of thing you get

78
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,850
given us an event like the edge that

79
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,020
you're probably some of you are wearing

80
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,430
at the moment art badges are not

81
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,310
official badges for an event so you're

82
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,630
probably familiar with the DEF CON

83
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,330
badges DEFCON in the states they are

84
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,340
produced by individual groups and

85
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,169
they're much more sort of expression at

86
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,539
stubby LED light shows there may be

87
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,310
games whatever but they're usually

88
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,560
created as something pretty to look at

89
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,220
rather than as a functional item but

90
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,990
appreciate probably familiar with this

91
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,310
and shitty add-ons or little add-on

92
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,740
boards that plug into a standard

93
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,850
connector the idea that you can

94
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,070
embellish your badge with all sorts of

95
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,530
different little add-ons and there are

96
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,680
all sorts of novelties there are sensors

97
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,660
there input devices you name it it's

98
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,490
been made for a shitty add-on connector

99
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,590
but as I say this is a slide at the

100
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,750
offshoot people so you probably are more

101
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,660
familiar with this and this is coming on

102
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,130
to what I was realizing that we love

103
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,030
badges we want lots of badges

104
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,820
is everywhere but the trouble is when

105
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,830
you come home from a event an event you

106
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,330
think was really cool it's a hackable

107
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,710
badge I can do stuff with it and it goes

108
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,170
in the drawer and gets forgotten and I

109
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,690
think probably most of us have got quite

110
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,390
a big drawer full of badges and they

111
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,040
come out every now and then you say oh

112
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,080
yes I remember this event or you know

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,260
you said wander around the sort of

114
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,900
statement that I was cool but how do we

115
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,540
use random badges now we've all got

116
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,060
badges which were cool on the day but

117
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,820
have you done think since this was just

118
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,950
some of the ones of mine I think there's

119
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,270
one there that I borrowed from a friend

120
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,840
for something but great big box full of

121
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,580
badges which is I just felt was a shame

122
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,000
so this is a personal manifesto No

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,110
and it's been difficult really because

124
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,250
I'm an electronic engineer but I'm a

125
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,790
journalist I'd love to do my own badge

126
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,610
but I haven't had time so I'm talking to

127
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,280
people who actually make badges here and

128
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,530
I don't make badges and I don't want to

129
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,360
be standing here saying yes this is how

130
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,980
you should make badges because I don't

131
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,240
make badges and I can't tell you how to

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,160
do your job so this is a it's a personal

133
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,940
manifesto of what I would like to see in

134
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,120
the future event badges with an eye to

135
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,850
making them all useful in the future I

136
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,280
don't want people to sort of take it as

137
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,660
me telling you how to do your job you

138
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,560
feel free to tell me to sod off this is

139
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,780
my thoughts on what I'd like to see as I

140
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,490
say this was written for a slightly

141
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,980
different audience so I don't want to

142
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,970
sort of I wasn't talking to badge team

143
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,550
people when I wrote this but the first

144
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,620
thing any bad should do is be useful

145
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,210
now most event badges are useful so at

146
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,740
the event you've fired up and you get

147
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,730
the event schedule or whatever other

148
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,970
event related apps but when you get home

149
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,620
the event schedule is not much use

150
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,140
unless you want to sit there and pay to

151
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,030
attend little menus to some reminisce

152
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,380
about how wonderful that

153
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,930
I read what that talk was was it's it's

154
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,670
not as you so you want something that

155
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,230
three months later

156
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,990
what will this badge be useful for now

157
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,730
this is one of the badge team members

158
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,770
did this it's a little demo weather app

159
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,810
that's a brilliant example on a sharp

160
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,210
edge of something that's useful after

161
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,150
the event it's using it as in this case

162
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,550
a weather display might be something for

163
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,800
an IOT thing or whatever you want to

164
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,380
think how will my badge be useful after

165
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,390
the event even a clock I mean there's

166
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,159
badges here that have clocks on if you

167
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,330
use a clock or if you have something

168
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,440
that is driven by a an online source

169
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,630
make it an online source it isn't only

170
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,550
specific they don't make it something so

171
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,740
that if you have a weather thing it

172
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,060
doesn't just tell you the weather at

173
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,970
scouting land skies a welder it tells

174
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,560
you the weather in Oxfordshire where you

175
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,170
live where I live so that's what I want

176
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,550
to see but it covers not just the

177
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,420
software

178
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,870
it covers software and hardware design

179
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,360
so for instance I'm skating on thin ice

180
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,830
here because some of the people who made

181
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,460
this there in front of me but this is a

182
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,790
shower 2017 badge right software-wise

183
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,040
great you can put your weather app on it

184
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,980
this is quite good because it's quite

185
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,630
stands up quite nicely there are other

186
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,160
badges which don't stand up so nicely

187
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,410
another curved autumn or whatever and I

188
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,660
believe somebody's made a 3d printable

189
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,000
it'll stand you can see you so that's

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,600
it's nicely on the desk but this is a

191
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,920
good example of something that gets

192
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,280
nearly right but the sort of the sort of

193
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,540
the sort of thing you've got to think

194
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,160
about and and the thing is this is this

195
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,420
is this is something it was written for

196
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,150
a different audience right the power

197
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,310
lead it's on top when we have this

198
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,720
sitting on my desk I have a great coil

199
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,120
cable coming out the top if the power

200
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,030
lever on the side so that's a little

201
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,640
example this is a fantastic badge this

202
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,830
is one of the best badges I've ever seen

203
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,350
now the points this is this well we all

204
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,970
know I mean come on we all know this is

205
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,110
a fantastic badge right yeah yeah but we

206
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,510
all know this is a fence

207
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,940
vej but this is a little example of a

208
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,530
tiny design feature which is the sort of

209
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,910
thing that when you're making a badge

210
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,740
for useful in the future this is the

211
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,650
sort of thing to think about and I am I

212
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,740
am I'm walking right into the Lions Den

213
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,750
by you know but but but this is this is

214
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,370
a pertinent example because it's an

215
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,900
example that I think everybody will

216
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,820
understand it's not a sort of sort of

217
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,290
terrible criticism God knows there are

218
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,510
badges I will criticize but you know

219
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,150
that this is a good quick example of

220
00:10:52,150 --> 00:11:06,130
little design change which no no tell

221
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,540
firmware on it job done um the other one

222
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,660
is be hackable now somebody here today

223
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,180
has a an EMF an EMF badge right now EMF

224
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,640
badges are really intrusively designed

225
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,380
right the problem they have is that if

226
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,280
you want to write software for an EMF

227
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,430
badge your instant really into elite

228
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,450
stuff right now you have to download a

229
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,300
tool chain great arcane Linux tool chain

230
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,340
which takes quite a long time sudo

231
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,080
apt-get install blah blah blah and then

232
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,370
you sit there for whatever and then

233
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,870
you've got to know how to use it you've

234
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,580
got to fire up whichever text edit or

235
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,520
whatever and there was a massive barrier

236
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,300
to entry for developing for it and then

237
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,890
once you have written your app you then

238
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,920
had to supply it to the bad people for

239
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,330
you if we would build it into an

240
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,530
official firmware and then it would go

241
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,240
on on the badge and that wasn't very

242
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,340
peccable surprising enough it's not

243
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,440
always that way so for instance the

244
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,600
board neck patch in the summer it's a

245
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,360
little cortex m0 was it um Maxim was it

246
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,240
I think it's a maxim cortex m0 and that

247
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,460
for that the tool chain was actually

248
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,870
surprisingly simple they've done a

249
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,259
really good job there I was

250
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:32,029
Eve will able to install the to chain on

251
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,549
a Chromebook which absolutely shocked me

252
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:35,749
and I was able to write my little hello

253
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:37,479
well that there's not always that way

254
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:41,899
but if it is easily hackable its usable

255
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,819
after the event now of course coming

256
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:47,269
back to the shell badge this is where

257
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,399
the char badge and its descendants

258
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,169
score beautifully because you can go on

259
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:56,600
to the hatchery I want to say App Store

260
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,859
but in your hatchery you got that

261
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:00,709
actually and bang out - and actually

262
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,569
give it onto the badge the flipside of

263
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:04,579
this is of course when you do that the

264
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:06,199
world and dog can see your crappy

265
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,559
software before you've got it right but

266
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:15,799
well yes that's true but you know the

267
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,139
trouble is I mean I I'm not elite I

268
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,169
count myself as 13 36 and a half because

269
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,479
yeah I can normally get thrown like this

270
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:26,059
working but if I have problems with a

271
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,539
tool chain

272
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,699
what hope as a Windows user who's come

273
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:34,339
in because they do some you know they

274
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:35,569
have a slight interest but they're not a

275
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:43,279
software person and I think I wrote that

276
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,720
down and I deal bad should be hackable

277
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,339
with minimal effort using something the

278
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:48,139
recipient already has a web browser or a

279
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:50,749
USB mic - for example but the bottom

280
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:52,720
line is actually very important

281
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,069
documentation now I can tell you a

282
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:58,279
little story about a camp I went to in

283
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,359
2017 right

284
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:04,730
i sat this is actually a very easily

285
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,089
hackable badge as you know right i sat

286
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,569
in the British village and then we were

287
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,699
sitting there for about an hour and we

288
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,529
believe it none of us managed to get our

289
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:19,159
code onto this badge and this is really

290
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,379
embarrassing to admit this but you know

291
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:23,419
why it's because we're all had it

292
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,889
plugged in and it said on the screen

293
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,809
that it was at the loading screen and we

294
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:28,519
were waiting trying to connect it

295
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,199
wouldn't connect and what we hadn't

296
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:31,879
realised was that if you leave it it

297
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,399
goes to sleep but because it's an ink

298
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,279
screen and there was actually a

299
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,720
documentation thing and I appreciate the

300
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,939
documentation now says that but at the

301
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:42,980
time none of us had found that and so

302
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,760
believe

303
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,620
we sat there for ages and couldn't get

304
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,990
any plumbing software on this badge for

305
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,620
something that simple so I know I say

306
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,910
this because I'm a writer

307
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,260
but documentation is as much part of the

308
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,970
user experience for making the badge

309
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,770
hackable and giving your life after the

310
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,430
event because if you can't if your

311
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,320
average Windows user or whatever can't

312
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
figure out how to talk to the badge and

313
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,100
how to get software on it it can be the

314
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,840
best badge in the universe and they'll

315
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,130
be sitting there frustrated and they'll

316
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:25,280
move on it also has to offer sighs I

317
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,130
think that's a thing I haven't left put

318
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,010
in here which I should have put in but

319
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:38,000
something has to work now I don't have

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,500
one here but you're probably familiar

321
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
with the radio badge from communication

322
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,940
Kemp 2015 I had a big argument with my

323
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,830
colleagues it was that communication

324
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,660
count it wasn't a committee 2015 to him

325
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,280
the radio badge is the best batch ever

326
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,260
and it is this a wonderful badge it's

327
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,850
got a software-defined radio on a badge

328
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,220
how cool is that

329
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,270
but and to him everybody was hacking

330
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,830
their badge and it was really cool and

331
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,420
you got software-defined radio and

332
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,560
everything it's the most wonderful badge

333
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,400
ever to me I wasn't there when I wrote a

334
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,080
piece about badge life for heck space

335
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,500
magazine last year I asked a bunch of

336
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,540
hackerspace friends hey you went to see

337
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,030
city in 2015 do you have a badge I can

338
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,150
borrow and I was offered five none of

339
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,480
them worked because they are either

340
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,090
hadn't worked out of the bag the

341
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,090
firmware had gone wrong somehow or other

342
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,750
things that these people are they're not

343
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,540
they're not my sort of windows user they

344
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,310
are they are power users they would be

345
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,880
expected to get things working and they

346
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,830
couldn't get their radio badge working

347
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,860
because it's an awesome badge and anyway

348
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,540
this is where I had my argument with

349
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,550
Elliot my colleague that to him it's the

350
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,350
canonical awesome badge

351
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,210
and to me it's the canonical badge that

352
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,910
didn't work I mean there are I know it's

353
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,710
difficult it's hellishly difficult

354
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,339
getting a badge to the hands of the

355
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,449
users and it's something that char did

356
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,680
brilliantly I mean we had a working

357
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,530
badge delivered they won yeah but it's

358
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,959
almost a cautionary tale that is the

359
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,359
user doesn't if you user can't use it

360
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,910
then it's never gonna use them after the

361
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,260
event either which is horrible to say

362
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,350
because I'm treading on the most

363
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,080
vulnerable toes of any badge developer

364
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:43,220
anyway expandability so many badges

365
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,870
don't have anything to plug into and a

366
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,040
large amount of bad check is the

367
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,680
hardware side and I haven't get more

368
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,170
sort of personal manifesto ideas on that

369
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,430
which I want to share that's the EMF

370
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,210
badge that is that's a 2016 1

371
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,890
that's probably one the most expandable

372
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,440
badges that I've been given because it's

373
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,880
got it's actually covered in interfaces

374
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,990
what is you know it's got it's got a

375
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,850
port expander it's got load of gpo's

376
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,940
it's got these crocodile clip and for me

377
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,650
old Jack's it's got a bunch of other

378
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,860
sockets on the back what are you so many

379
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,040
batches just don't have anything or when

380
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,870
they do they have proprietary folks I

381
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,310
mean normally no they don't have a CDI

382
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,510
squid

383
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,720
yeah 3.3 volts they'll have Grove which

384
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,580
is again one of the serial things

385
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,880
they'll have a proprietary pin out so

386
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,560
for instance it's got a proprietary

387
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,770
socket on the back or some of the older

388
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,910
badges Hertz Arduino classic Arduino

389
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,120
standard obviously now I'm going to make

390
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,680
a plea to badge designers I appreciate

391
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,130
that

392
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,490
classic Arduino is very dated nowadays

393
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,400
but I would love to see more badges with

394
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,250
a stand

395
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,419
pinout I would suggest maybe something

396
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,220
like Edith root feather something like

397
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,159
that but something where the punters are

398
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,840
have a reasonable chance of having

399
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,429
something they can plug into it already

400
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,190
the reason is I'm sorry come back to

401
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,909
this this one I went to in 2017

402
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:31,070
there was somebody produced a

403
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,940
prototyping board for this and I didn't

404
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:46,770
get my hands on one but so many batches

405
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,630
that the the EMF one as well

406
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,340
there's nothing can plug into it you

407
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,460
have to have dangly wires off it to have

408
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,059
something like for the wing or whichever

409
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,520
other standard one they are likely to

410
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,549
have again makes such a difference so

411
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,740
yes this is a personal manifesto plea if

412
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,809
if anybody is thinking of making about

413
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:07,799
just think in terms of that

414
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,840
accountability because I think that's

415
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,190
something that'll make a difference to

416
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,880
make it usable by people down the line

417
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,460
that we said and then support

418
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,130
maintenance now the example I'm I saw

419
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,720
used to describe this is actually well

420
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
most of you are sitting in front of me I

421
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,270
mean we've all got badges where the last

422
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,400
firmware update comes on the last day of

423
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,630
the camp and that's it and it doesn't

424
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,830
work now coming back to that camp I went

425
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,870
to in 2017 I mean I believe was it last

426
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,610
the last update on this was about a few

427
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,539
weeks ago now and I believe are you

428
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:57,350
promising to release them until 2021

429
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,789
yeah and they'll probably be more more

430
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:02,220
after that so I can't I can't okay

431
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,260
I mean I'm preaching to the converted

432
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,760
here obviously but it's so important and

433
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,470
it's the thing that makes me excited

434
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,570
about Bausch team is the fact that you

435
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,250
have the continuing ongoing support and

436
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,820
the app store which means that if I go

437
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,149
back and look at the shop I should look

438
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,100
what the most recent app for the shore

439
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,720
2017 badges in

440
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,669
actually but there are some that are

441
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:29,190
quite recent aren't there I mean I think

442
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,590
I updated the hackaday one quite

443
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,360
recently impressive yeah but the point

444
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,130
but the point is that's that's that's

445
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,450
for an event that's nearly three years

446
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,490
ago and how many other events are there

447
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:53,130
like that there aren't any well but the

448
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,200
thing is this this this was this this

449
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,390
was written for a different audience and

450
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,070
I'm actually talking to the people I'm

451
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,809
talking about here so this is a kind of

452
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:03,179
redundant slide today but how you gets

453
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,380
it through all them and the last one is

454
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,480
just fun now you ought you all know the

455
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,169
camp zone badge this in a way breaks all

456
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,380
the rules have just talked about it's

457
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,270
it's not expandable I mean ok it's got

458
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,799
me it's got this the support and

459
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,210
everything like that and it's not the

460
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,760
most pressure but it's not the most

461
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,250
high-resolution display whatever but

462
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,570
this will

463
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,150
you'll be seeing these badges around

464
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,190
people's necks for years to come

465
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,919
they're about to do a second run of them

466
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,169
aren't they they will sell like hotcakes

467
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:48,570
I walked around I mean I'm pretty sure

468
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,250
you've all seen this badge but if you

469
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,400
haven't um I walked around kara

470
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,650
communication camp in the summer with

471
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,740
this after dark nyan cat and I had a

472
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,570
constant stream of people coming up to

473
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,320
me say what is he where do I get one

474
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,419
that fun thing means that this and

475
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,120
badges like it will have a continuous

476
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,049
life for years I mean if I go to a camp

477
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,760
in 10 years time with this around my

478
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,110
neck I'm sure I'll still have people

479
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,360
coming up to me asking me where I can

480
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,010
get one if they don't know where you

481
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,740
know what it is so that's the elusive

482
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,070
ingredient that every tries to get and

483
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,070
sometimes people fail I mean when I gave

484
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,820
this talk originally in Hebden Bridge I

485
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,530
um I brought along a big sort of show

486
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,350
and actually one of the examples I used

487
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,590
to be eating your own dog food one of

488
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,600
the examples I used for what not to do

489
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,130
on a badge was actually an amazing badge

490
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,540
it was the hack of a super conference

491
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,170
passion 2017 because it breaks so many

492
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,000
of the rules it's got those ongoing

493
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,400
software support it's not expandable

494
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,930
it's got all the things but

495
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,030
unfortunately eating one's own dog food

496
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,710
when one hasn't got the badge is

497
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,150
difficult so I've had to eat somebody

498
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,930
else's dog food but if you look at some

499
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,160
of the other badges I've been able to

500
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,060
randomly borrow

501
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,220
here's your probably most of you will be

502
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,750
familiar with the heck Otel badge

503
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,940
boring one it's very similar to the

504
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,720
sharp edge it's got a Grove connector

505
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,570
for expansion sadly it would be great if

506
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,040
it had the same expansion as the shine I

507
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,840
appreciate that so that's a cost thing

508
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,730
isn't it you know you can only put so

509
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,780
many components on a badge can't you the

510
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,930
disobey badge is yet again another badge

511
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,250
team badge but design finish only yeah

512
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,710
this one unfortunately this has doesn't

513
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,590
have any expandability it's not an

514
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,450
expansion connector I don't know this

515
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,890
badge very well I I've only just

516
00:24:47,890 --> 00:25:01,800
borrowed what yeah well you need the

517
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,630
Troubles this is the first time handing

518
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,610
a troopers badge as well that's got a

519
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,960
Grove has has got any other headers I

520
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,340
mean I like I like this one this one's

521
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,490
got a QWERTY keyboard but I know they

522
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,400
always have this shield shape but it

523
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:26,260
doesn't stand up on the tags do you

524
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,120
think this would be used after the event

525
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,130
I don't know what the step I don't know

526
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,480
what the firmware this one's been done

527
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,790
Hector with badge team firmware what was

528
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:41,340
the thing well ok fair enough

529
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,070
but of course I'm going to save the most

530
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,350
the most fun badge to light til til the

531
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,170
end these badges are already good but

532
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,000
will any of them open a beer bottle

533
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,970
right now that's the talk unfortunately

534
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,440
it's a slightly truncated version of the

535
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,640
talk and it's a slightly sort of

536
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,140
embarrassed version of the talk because

537
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,250
I'm talking to people who have more of a

538
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,900
stake in the game than the previous

539
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,110
people are talking to but we're coming

540
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,050
to the second part now I went on a great

541
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:26,040
detail about how I can see this to be I

542
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,570
genuinely believe but at some point in

543
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,510
the future there will be a somebody in

544
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,550
the art establishment somebody of the

545
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,290
sort of Damien Hirst kind of variety

546
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,930
some recent graduate from the London

547
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,670
College of Art or wherever the

548
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,380
equivalent in the Netherlands is or ever

549
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,600
will discover a printed circuit board

550
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,870
out and suddenly well no no but you will

551
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,580
you will I mean you'll suddenly see

552
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,050
you'll suddenly see sort of galleries

553
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,750
and people paying vast amounts for PCB

554
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,250
art and badges and all the hacker

555
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,690
community or are we thought of this

556
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,810
first and I won't say we need to take

557
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,400
ownership of this if this something that

558
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,520
we as a community can be very proud of

559
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,940
so next year at EMF camp in the UK I'm

560
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,660
going to put in a proposal for a badge

561
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,750
Museum or a badge art gallery museum

562
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,010
gallery not sure what to call it

563
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,040
and what I want to do is I'm going to

564
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,480
put this to jaunty I'm going to ask him

565
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,390
for a grant to pay for like a marquee

566
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,360
and some tables and stuff probably will

567
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,250
have to make some display cases I want

568
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,750
to make it as close to a museum

569
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,580
experience as possible I don't want to

570
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,320
just be a sort of random tables without

571
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,120
cheese I'd like there to be badges that

572
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,370
you can actually interact with but I

573
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,080
would like to tell the story and the

574
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,060
history of badges now the problem is I

575
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,410
can't do this on my own I need other

576
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,720
people to help me because it's actually

577
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,090
as much as the display problem and a

578
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,380
staffing problem it's a logistical

579
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,520
problem I have to go round to as many

580
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,870
people as I can here we're going to have

581
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,380
awesome

582
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,870
oh geez so for instance like the DEF CON

583
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,290
badge life scene badges when I'm going

584
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,330
to have to say look you have this really

585
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,460
valuable and rare badge can I borrow it

586
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,440
and stick it in a field in England with

587
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,140
a bunch of people looking at it and I

588
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,700
have to persuade them that that's a good

589
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,110
that's a good idea

590
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,170
if I can find somebody who's got a 2006

591
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,830
DEFCON badge I want to borrow it and

592
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,730
it's probably one of those things you

593
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,080
have to stick in a glass case with

594
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,140
lasers and security guards or something

595
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,540
but that's the kind of thing I've got to

596
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,310
do I'm probably going to ask my editor

597
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,470
I'm probably going to ask my editor at

598
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,530
hackaday for some kind of sponsorship

599
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,420
I'm probably going to see if they will

600
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,000
pay for insurance and shipping for those

601
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
kind of things

602
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,410
I'm also this is something that if it

603
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,550
works I would like it to appear a future

604
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,950
camp so I'd love to bring it to met or

605
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,940
whatever it's going to be called well no

606
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,680
it's it's it's our conscious it's the

607
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,210
celebration of our culture so I would

608
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,800
like to bring it to whatever camp is

609
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,090
coming up and it's something that I

610
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,620
don't think should be Jenny lists page

611
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,970
museum I think it needs to be owned by

612
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,540
the community so I was hoping that

613
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,720
something like badge team but if not

614
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,860
something some other community-based

615
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,790
organization would be able to take

616
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,860
ownership of they the name and the idea

617
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,750
rather than at least of my thing if that

618
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,890
makes sense I would like to bring this

619
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,020
together as a group of people to try and

620
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,410
plan this to be able to have it ready to

621
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:38,790
go

622
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,400
arrived on the scene unpack boxes put it

623
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,100
all up display boards the works and I'd

624
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,730
like it to have be an experience where

625
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,070
you feel like you're walking into a

626
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,930
serious exhibit I'm if this is something

627
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,160
I've been thinking about anything last

628
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,040
week or two so it's something that isn't

629
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,880
fully formed I was thinking of possibly

630
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,850
opening maybe a dedicated sock channel

631
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,790
or similar or actually you

632
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,490
telegram thank you yeah okay probably

633
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:19,240
dedicate to telegram channel I'll tell

634
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,730
you what I'll I'll set up a BBS and you

635
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:33,190
can dial in keep keep keep keep keep it

636
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,330
old-school

637
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,320
now I'll sort of a BBS and we can all

638
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:45,010
use a bulletin board the scary thing is

639
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,840
this has probably got the processing

640
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,910
power and the networking to run multiple

641
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,790
BBS's at once now there is a challenge

642
00:30:51,790 --> 00:31:04,540
for one of you but but I can but I

643
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,620
consider this to be an important thing

644
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,310
but I realized that I can write a

645
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,470
proposal I can do a certain amount of

646
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,520
the stuff but this is something that

647
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,680
will need a bunch of people so this is

648
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,040
kind of a pitch for if anybody is

649
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,110
interested in the idea of a badge Museum

650
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:26,200
O'Hara camps I think it we good if we

651
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,360
could form some kind of groups to do it

652
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,940
and I would like suggestions on what

653
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,280
badges should be in it I have some ideas

654
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,900
on the sort of themes of the X

655
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,900
exhibitions but unlike suggestions on

656
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,790
what badges to put in it what's what

657
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,100
what you would like to see to celebrate

658
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,300
it as an art form

659
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,270
so I said to you really what's what what

660
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:56,190
do you think yeah

661
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:07,820
okay absolutely yes

662
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:13,880
if nothing else if nothing else there

663
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:21,620
was an actual bar yeah but no seriously

664
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,300
I mean I've probably talked to some of

665
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,530
you about this already but I'm

666
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,410
canvassing thoughts and opinions and

667
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,770
canvassing for people who might be

668
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,270
interested in participating what do you

669
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:44,809
think I was actually thinking some if

670
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:47,540
you think no way a museum works there

671
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,390
are sort of exhibitions so for instance

672
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,860
you would have an exhibition in which

673
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,730
sort of the early origins of badges and

674
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,710
then you might have one that focuses on

675
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,190
an exhibition of I know Def Con bash

676
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,400
life badges or you probably have that's

677
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,020
sort of all the different badge team

678
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,120
badges I mean you know have a sort of an

679
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:20,030
overlapping sort of well you you could

680
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,040
but I feel that it's important not just

681
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,290
to have a dry air as a badge here is

682
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,910
another patch here in another badge but

683
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,710
to have it like a museum would with

684
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,220
actual cogently thought outs exhibits if

685
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,670
that makes sense

686
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:56,510
oh yes yeah yeah um yes yeah yeah well

687
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,610
if there is one thing that I know I can

688
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,809
do it is write copy

689
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:09,149
that would be nice

690
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:12,000
I mean it is an important thing that I

691
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,619
know more than one of the people I've

692
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,330
talked to agree with me on this one

693
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,310
that's where possible they should be

694
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:23,429
interactive so that would be very cool

695
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,929
if at all possible but for instance when

696
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,790
you have a char badge you know you have

697
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,168
your char badge on your little stand

698
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:30,510
with a light on top of it and you can go

699
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,190
out and you can press things on it and I

700
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,040
guarantee it won't be measured in

701
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,149
femtoseconds before tomorrow puts some

702
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:40,969
bad you know virus on it or something

703
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:44,040
so I expected to say still still pwned

704
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,139
anyway but but but no but that banana

705
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,460
the important thing that's an important

706
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,840
thing where it is possible it should be

707
00:34:51,840 --> 00:35:02,730
interactive you just want you just want

708
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,380
to look at boobs don't you know but yes

709
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,730
you're right you're right actually

710
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,680
having you know sometimes with there is

711
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,450
a context where it works better

712
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:18,150
displayed on the human form maybe want

713
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,550
maybe one's a Greek statue with an angle

714
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:30,560
across but but I mean yes indeed yeah

715
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:39,090
yeah well does this fly okay if if I set

716
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,900
up a telegram will you be interested if

717
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:49,340
I register a URL or whatever

718
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,770
I know that bash team doesn't have a

719
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,920
foundation yet will badge team ever have

720
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:13,430
a foundation okay I mean yeah I mean

721
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:17,390
whatever whatever yeah yeah it's that

722
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,120
the the reason I'm asking this question

723
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,710
is I don't want this to be Jenny's badge

724
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:27,590
Museum because it shouldn't be owned by

725
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,240
one person this has to be owned by the

726
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,320
community this is a community

727
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:41,570
celebration of itself rather than how

728
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:47,780
much how well is this job paid yeah now

729
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,880
but but but the point is it has to be

730
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,100
something that's isn't there Kemp like

731
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,020
anything in this community resilience

732
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,420
comes from transferability and not

733
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,040
concentration in one place for anything

734
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:05,480
else okay I will go away and I will set

735
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,910
up a telegram and I will write a pitch

736
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,750
which I will send to John T I mean that

737
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,220
more than one person has commented and I

738
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,170
don't think he fully agree with this I

739
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,760
don't think John T would say no and I've

740
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,380
definitely had more than one person

741
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,840
involved with me saying yes we want it

742
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,650
so I would be if if it's possible to

743
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,570
make it happen it would be something I

744
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,310
would want to see at future events like

745
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:43,640
that yeah the Milly ways of badge museum

746
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,810
yes but yeah I mean it's not it's not

747
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,690
that good yeah cool in that case I think

748
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:53,980
that concludes what I need to say and I

749
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,570
hope I haven't trod on any too many toes

750
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,550
by pointing out all the obvious flaws in

751
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,060
the chard 2017 better

752
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,830
[Laughter]

753
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:09,880
well yeah that's true

754
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,229
I mean to be on it to be honest it's

755
00:38:11,229 --> 00:38:13,059
very difficult to critique this badge

756
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:18,640
because you know well no no no compared

757
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,929
to the other badges you've done a damn

758
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:24,099
fine job with this I can't okay I used

759
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:27,099
really tough dual sided tape mine fell

760
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,009
off at the event mine fell off at the

761
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:31,509
event and you gave me some very tough

762
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,459
double-sided tape which is held ever

763
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:35,669
since

764
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,329
yeah and mine is also one of the ones

765
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:42,069
with the little bodge resistor which is

766
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:45,900
absolute hero soldering whoever did it

767
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,459
but anyway thank you very much thank you

768
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,890
for listening and I will do some action

769
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,160
on that

770
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,319
Hey

771
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,170
huh since already five minutes overtime

772
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,490
let's begin

773
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,260
hi I'm someone some gum I'm gonna talk

774
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:53,770
about spectrum oh it try to hi I'm

775
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:54,910
Thomas and I'm going to talk about

776
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:57,910
spectra device which enables open

777
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:01,720
biomedical imaging for the masses it's a

778
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,120
really really new product this is the

779
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,130
spectra itself it's an actual device

780
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:09,400
just it's not a technique it's a

781
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,650
Kickstarter and I was really really

782
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,030
nervous about not giving any

783
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,620
presentation or demo at all because it

784
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,500
only arrived last Thursday just to give

785
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,190
you an idea of how recent the device and

786
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,300
the technologies are that I'm going to

787
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,690
talk about but first what is biomedical

788
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,040
imaging and what can we do with it

789
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,770
current leader is a lot of pushing the

790
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,430
boundaries on biomedical imaging on the

791
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,470
high-end skill so I myself work on

792
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:38,410
7-tesla MRI and we do amazing stuff with

793
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,360
pushing the resolutions and scan times

794
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,040
down to quarter millimeter of cubicle

795
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,190
voxels and super-fast sub-second scan

796
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,010
times and different contrasts and that's

797
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,540
all nice and low because we for example

798
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,930
in the brain we can discover the knee

799
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,000
were working mechanisms and layers and

800
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,220
we can do really cool stuff with it but

801
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,050
we don't need to push the technological

802
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,200
boundaries in this and to produce cool

803
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,950
things because does anyone know what an

804
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,740
MRI machine like this cost just was

805
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:16,720
wondering how many 1.2 now it's a bit

806
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,020
more now it's not 10 but it's it's about

807
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,730
a million per Tesla this is a 3 Tesla

808
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,560
machine show the machine itself costs

809
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,080
approximately 3 million euros but then

810
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,970
you also need all the space for it and

811
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:30,340
all the servicing contracts they cost

812
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,780
full of helium to operate ceilings

813
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,820
getting really expensive and it's not

814
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,850
something which is for the masses which

815
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,820
also shows in the fact that if we take a

816
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,000
look at the distribution of imaging

817
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,530
modalities across the world we can see

818
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,510
that West Africa only has I think it was

819
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,820
8080 for MRI scanners in total of which

820
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,820
two thirds were in Nigeria and

821
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,540
old arrests are ya don't have any access

822
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,600
to to imaging modalities like mr which

823
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,380
is really quite sad and it also we hack

824
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:10,300
Earth's don't have easy access to it how

825
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,740
many order will wide that varies the

826
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,540
state says a lot we also have a lot in

827
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,150
Netherlands I think it's I think it's

828
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:21,430
100 per million or so so it's it's a lot

829
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:25,720
more than they have in Africa and then

830
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,420
just recently improv player she came

831
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,370
along I T it stands for electrical

832
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,080
impedance tomography and it's a

833
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,100
relatively new sort of imaging modality

834
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,020
what it does is it measures electrical

835
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,060
impedances and does a tomography so

836
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,470
let's just say it makes a reconstruction

837
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:44,080
of an image with it and how does that

838
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,550
compare to the current modalities we use

839
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,310
so I've put it up a table with a normal

840
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:51,160
CT like a cat scan MRI ultrasounds and

841
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,290
also I put an EEG as a comparison eg

842
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,870
isn't really an imaging modality but

843
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,950
it's something that's used

844
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,440
diagnostically and also experimentally

845
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,720
for example in the open BCI project I'm

846
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,870
sorry about the fuzziness the main

847
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:10,210
advantage of AIT is that it's really

848
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,100
really really cheap in comparison and

849
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,420
accessible to all these things it's not

850
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,340
dangerous it's not big or bulky and it's

851
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:24,430
hackable but of course since we don't

852
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,210
see a question already

853
00:48:36,759 --> 00:48:40,399
all summer lipo's no sadly don't Philips

854
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:41,659
you is not actually part of Philips

855
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:43,099
anymore

856
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:45,469
I'll show you some brief pictures in a

857
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:47,029
moment and I'll do a demonstration at

858
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:50,719
the end and I think if you slightly

859
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,369
remember the second picture of the brain

860
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:54,619
and if you do a rough comparison and I

861
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:56,959
think you'll agree that Philips is not

862
00:48:56,959 --> 00:48:59,989
in trouble yet because it changed that

863
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:03,889
GI t produces are currently not

864
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:05,869
comparable to do the quality that we

865
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:09,259
have but well I think we'll get get to

866
00:49:09,259 --> 00:49:14,089
that in a bit similar but first since

867
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:15,289
we're gonna introduce it to you as a

868
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:19,639
hacking tool should first make sure that

869
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:21,859
it's actually safe to use and safe to

870
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:24,199
hack with so I myself participated in a

871
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:26,809
lot of studies and I do a lot of medical

872
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:30,199
research things and it's an sometimes

873
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:32,719
really easy to you go into the gray area

874
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,029
of which is healthy for you and which is

875
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:38,839
not but luckily the spectra totally

876
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:44,869
complies with E I see 6t 601 guidelines

877
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:47,539
with because it uses very very little

878
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:50,089
currents to measure impedances it puts

879
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:51,739
out a very small current between two

880
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:52,880
electrodes and measures the voltage

881
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,969
between them and the first currents

882
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:57,769
usually are feasible like around at the

883
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:00,109
1 milliamp mark and it's a couple of

884
00:50:00,109 --> 00:50:01,549
factors lower because it will never

885
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:04,789
produce currents more than 10 micro amps

886
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:08,839
and the loud current also goes up with a

887
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,789
specific formula this as I stated in the

888
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:13,279
EIC regulations the problem with having

889
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:15,229
very low currents is that you also get

890
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:17,899
you don't get a lot of voltage or a

891
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:20,239
specific impedance so you need to have

892
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,599
very advanced electronics and good ATC's

893
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,909
and low noise measurement setups and

894
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:27,499
expensive chips to actually still

895
00:50:27,499 --> 00:50:29,839
produce some results out of these small

896
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,669
currents but that's the only way you can

897
00:50:31,669 --> 00:50:35,359
do it legally and safely which brings me

898
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,909
on to the specific hardware that is now

899
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:41,380
available and usable for this it's

900
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,350
Kickstarter as I said it was deliver

901
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,200
just lost forest day and the starter

902
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,380
criss-crossed $309 which sounds

903
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,270
expensive and it is because the PCB is

904
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,580
only 2 inches by 2 inches but it has

905
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,710
some pretty advanced analog stuff on it

906
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,650
mainly it's powered by the ad you see

907
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,620
I'm 350 which is a IC specifically

908
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,560
designed for doing these impedance meet

909
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,660
ranks and it also has a lot of safety

910
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,840
features for current-limiting which is

911
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,550
kind of handy if you want to try it on

912
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,070
yourself instead of just fruits and it

913
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,560
also has some micro poisoning powers and

914
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,420
some Bluetooth capabilities to make it

915
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:24,360
usable and attractive and then I have a

916
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,070
couple of first images one of these two

917
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,140
images is the first image that was

918
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,180
produced by an MRI scanner and the other

919
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,800
one is one of the first images that was

920
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,860
produced by electrical and penis

921
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:39,300
tomography irons wondering which one do

922
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:45,480
you think is which you can also just use

923
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,450
as an LCR meter but then it's a really

924
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:51,870
expensive LCR meter and also an LCR

925
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,940
meter don't usually need a fully Tube

926
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,410
channel and a whole bunch of analog

927
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,340
multiplexers it's it's basically a 32

928
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,870
port network analyzer yeah yeah the chip

929
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,510
is also used in basic network analyzers

930
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:07,500
a very high ton of the specs on the

931
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,900
sides but very high so which picture you

932
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,400
think comes from an MRI in which picture

933
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,860
comes from impedance yeah nice you got

934
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,930
that right yeah so the left is in need

935
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,120
to MRI and the right is there is the

936
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,430
Venus tomography and looking at the

937
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:27,540
current time right pictures they of

938
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,700
course look a lot a lot better but the

939
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,620
RT picture currently in comparison to a

940
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,690
modern MRI it looks really crap but if

941
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,370
we compare it to one of the first MRI

942
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:39,960
pictures we had it's actually not that

943
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,680
bad

944
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,720
we're just in the very early stages of

945
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,840
imaging electrical properties and it

946
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,850
just will take some years and some

947
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,100
research to push the new boundary than

948
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,110
that so yeah you're right

949
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,190
so how does this work how do you get a

950
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,160
picture of conductivities and electrical

951
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,860
impedances well what this thing does it

952
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,740
has an array of 32 channels and it can

953
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,230
produce an AC current not DC because IC

954
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,030
is usually safer

955
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:11,340
between a pair of any of these two

956
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,740
electrodes and then measure the current

957
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,750
between it and if you put current

958
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,180
through a conducting object according to

959
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,010
you how conductive the materials are in

960
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,930
between you've got a specific sort of

961
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:23,610
current density which is shown by the

962
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:28,320
blue and red I'm sorry blue and black

963
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,320
I'm sorry the lines in a in the in the

964
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,810
tissue and some places the lines will be

965
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,070
really dense there we squish together

966
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:36,690
because it will be highly conductive so

967
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,650
there'll be a lot of current and on

968
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,660
others it will not as you can see in

969
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,100
this picture the two black things are

970
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,220
lungs and you can see most of the lines

971
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,900
triangle outside of the lungs because

972
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:59,600
air doesn't conduct yeah yeah mm-hmm

973
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,330
true in principle it you can already you

974
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:06,270
can also do just resistance but the

975
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,980
measurements are usually too noisy so

976
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,510
what you preferably do is a frequency

977
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,700
sweep so you can actually actually map

978
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,470
out all the tissue parameters you've got

979
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,600
a another dimension basically of data

980
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,510
and principle resistance is fine and

981
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,390
basically I think indeed impedances are

982
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:25,580
a lot nicer but the main problem why

983
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,510
resistances are not use is basically

984
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,310
noise because if you put in an AC signal

985
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,080
and you measure the same AC voltage back

986
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,240
you know that you're exactly measuring

987
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,530
impedances instead of

988
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:37,920
just static noise that you pick up but

989
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,040
yeah indeed AC is a lot more interesting

990
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,720
there's mainly because it adds noise

991
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,240
resistance and more data to make an

992
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,640
image we already have a quite nice

993
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,350
understanding of how these parts will

994
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,600
flow to different objects and luckily we

995
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,400
already have a lot of algorithms and a

996
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,210
lot of technology in place to

997
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,710
reconstruct these images it's an inverse

998
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,080
operation and it's almost the same which

999
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,990
is being done for CT and MRI so the back

1000
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,340
projection method is exactly the

1001
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,730
technique

1002
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,070
CT scanners use or cat scanners to make

1003
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,630
images and we can use the same

1004
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,130
techniques to produce an image shelf

1005
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:18,680
impedances and how that works is as

1006
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,520
demonstrated in the picture you measure

1007
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,839
all the pairs of electrodes that you

1008
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:26,670
have available for that skills up really

1009
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:30,200
quickly the number of electrodes and you

1010
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,540
basically get lines of where current can

1011
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,880
flow you do sort of back projection you

1012
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,320
solve the inverse problem and then you

1013
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,220
get the conductances out of your we get

1014
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,160
a picture with conductances of your

1015
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,750
object you can also do some more

1016
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,010
interesting stuff because you're using

1017
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,869
AC you can do spectral analysis you can

1018
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:54,630
you sweep up to the spectra does from a

1019
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,339
couple hundred Hertz to a couple

1020
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:58,740
kilohertz and different materials will

1021
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,780
have different impedances at different

1022
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,050
frequencies for example this is an apple

1023
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,690
and a sweet potato and you can see there

1024
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,589
very clearly indistinguishable by their

1025
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:11,520
responses to different excitation

1026
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,010
frequencies in this case the difference

1027
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,869
is quite huge but you can also use for

1028
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:18,569
example cooked and uncooked food or meat

1029
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:21,930
in different stages of being cooked and

1030
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,839
you can use the impedance of of for

1031
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,150
example your meat to at different

1032
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,740
frequencies to determine how well it's

1033
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,910
actually cooked before you cut it open

1034
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,460
so it doesn't have to just be very

1035
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,650
medical imaging you can also image your

1036
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:40,380
food and the chemicals in it if you cook

1037
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,490
this thing I don't think we'll have

1038
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,530
hands with EIT soon but I think it would

1039
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:47,569
be really cool I'm sorry

1040
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:52,980
how cool yeah and lastly the other type

1041
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,530
of analysis which is also possible is a

1042
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:58,619
time series analysis if you restrict

1043
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,810
yourself in normal channels you can also

1044
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,700
use that one channel continuously and

1045
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:08,160
then make impedances over time this is a

1046
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,579
graph of electrodes going from the back

1047
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:12,210
to the front

1048
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:15,390
measuring breathing and heart rates in

1049
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,099
one signal as you can see they're small

1050
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:18,810
humps are the periodic heart rate and

1051
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,849
the big going in and out if they're the

1052
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:22,759
size of the chest

1053
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:25,619
moving up and then collapsing down again

1054
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,779
and influencing the connectivity between

1055
00:57:27,779 --> 00:57:31,549
the two electrodes which is a really

1056
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:36,140
information rich information rich

1057
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,640
measurements because for example you

1058
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,329
could get both the modality of the heart

1059
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:44,849
rate and breathing in just one electrode

1060
00:57:44,849 --> 00:57:48,869
pair then I figured it would be nice for

1061
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:52,499
demo usually jammers don't work well but

1062
00:57:52,499 --> 00:57:58,410
I was hoping to actually show it over

1063
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:00,599
here after the spectra and a small bowl

1064
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,549
of water it has a little bit of salt in

1065
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:04,469
it to increase the connectivity at port

1066
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:12,479
I knew that's what happens let's try

1067
00:58:12,479 --> 00:58:14,689
that again

1068
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,410
you

1069
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:30,020
what why doesn't it say that

1070
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,020
that is interesting normally it's

1071
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,670
supposed to say a port in there but

1072
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:43,880
apparently fuscus not let's see if it

1073
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,560
still works anyway okay yeah it seems to

1074
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,390
still work

1075
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,690
so first let's try and connect up to it

1076
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:53,350
that seems to work

1077
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,820
currently the device is quite slow

1078
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,980
because it's outputting over a serial

1079
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,170
connection all the impedances of all the

1080
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,260
pairs in this case it's not using a full

1081
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,780
32 channel reconstruction but only 16

1082
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,090
because those 16 it's just quicker to

1083
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,860
measure their combinations if you do for

1084
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,840
your two channels to are eight hundred

1085
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,650
and ninety two different combinations

1086
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,880
that you have to measure and that takes

1087
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,830
a little bit of time effects like 20 30

1088
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,640
seconds if you do sixteen it's less so

1089
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,690
currently you can see this histogram

1090
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:26,420
down here that's histogram of all the

1091
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,190
impedances and the amplitude is it

1092
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,740
measures we can use this as a baseline

1093
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,180
because it's now currently empty and

1094
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,950
calibrated on lats as you can see then

1095
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,990
that spread becomes a lot smaller then

1096
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,560
we can try and put in for example and

1097
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,620
orange and see if that shows up

1098
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:45,500
so the first measurements will be crap

1099
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,900
because we only put it in half way and

1100
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,560
let's see if we can actually get a

1101
00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:02,330
picture out of it it looked like an

1102
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:03,560
orange but that's to be a representation

1103
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,720
of the top view of the ball because all

1104
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,780
the electrodes are in a 1d plane and you

1105
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,370
have to actually keep it still look as

1106
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,840
otherwise the water moves and that also

1107
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,270
creates interesting things now

1108
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:16,160
interesting it there I have a picture

1109
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,800
with also one of the nicer shortcomings

1110
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,900
of it you can sort of see shadows

1111
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,730
because of the back projections if you

1112
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,080
put it really close to one side of the

1113
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,490
electrodes no current can flow through

1114
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,220
and we'll think there are two objects in

1115
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,060
the same position approximately and yeah

1116
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,370
that's the current state of affairs of

1117
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:37,160
using impedances to image there we go

1118
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,020
that's a lot better already so the

1119
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,880
resolution is not that great and the

1120
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,210
time it's also not that great but it's

1121
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:45,770
an open source project it's called open

1122
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:46,430
EIT

1123
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,089
it's on github and it will need a lot of

1124
01:00:50,089 --> 01:00:51,530
more developments but then we'll have a

1125
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,780
really cool hackable imaging with other

1126
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,020
team

1127
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:08,950
mmm

1128
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:12,270
mm-hmm that's actually I think one of

1129
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:15,359
the use cases in which is it's now being

1130
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,700
tested with if you use like eight

1131
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,559
channels around the chest you know off

1132
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:22,500
had a vague imaging modality you can no

1133
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,270
image at a high resolution but you can

1134
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,980
at least do comparisons between left and

1135
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,809
right in front and where and then you

1136
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:31,289
can indeed you can check for water

1137
01:01:31,289 --> 01:01:32,849
ingress if people are lying on their

1138
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:36,210
back and seeing if they breathing is one

1139
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,319
thing but also seeing if there's

1140
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,299
actually air going in and out instead of

1141
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:40,650
other fluid should shouldn't be in there

1142
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,270
that's neat one of the things that it's

1143
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:48,380
now being used for yep

1144
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:08,770
I think the biggest limitation currently

1145
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:14,020
is the sorcerer in place the actual coat

1146
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,630
which is running on the device itself

1147
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:19,450
hasn't gotten hasn't been developed very

1148
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:21,880
far in the projection time I think of

1149
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,320
the Kickstarter I think that usually how

1150
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,840
it goes right as soon as the Kickstarter

1151
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,970
works then you're actually to ship out

1152
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,020
the hardware you need to produce a

1153
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,700
training needs buyer thing and then ship

1154
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,230
it out and done after work she'll still

1155
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:34,360
you start fixing the software so I think

1156
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,980
the software on the device isn't optimal

1157
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,540
it's really rather slow and the

1158
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,850
measurements aren't well optimized yet

1159
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:44,530
and also the reconstruction algorithms

1160
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:46,930
are in that are implemented here and

1161
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,910
it's very early stages also the factor

1162
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,680
that needs your calibration is kind of a

1163
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,650
shame because you cannot easily

1164
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,910
calibrate on a human body for example so

1165
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:59,380
there must be some outer calibration

1166
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:02,080
implemented or some absolute references

1167
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,370
to make easier pictures of stuff which

1168
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:14,620
is not a perfect test of like this I've

1169
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:17,860
heard that one before I wouldn't see how

1170
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,540
you would were to do that you need to

1171
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,270
some piezo I think in some some cue so

1172
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,420
in inducers to actually create sounds

1173
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,970
and pulses and stuff and I think you

1174
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:28,870
would need a completely different

1175
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,510
hardware setup for that because this is

1176
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,520
designed for really low currents and low

1177
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,610
voltages and usually ultrasonic

1178
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,860
transducers require pretty high voltages

1179
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,460
to operate

1180
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,120
yep

1181
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:21,339
yeah mm-hmm it's still critical conducts

1182
01:04:21,339 --> 01:04:47,200
a bit yeah of course if you're isolating

1183
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,819
Sheldon that won't work of course and

1184
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:50,319
this does also doesn't use the back

1185
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,940
projection method because the back

1186
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:53,289
rendition method in needs works very

1187
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,359
well for conduct for conductive stuff

1188
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,190
and highly conductive stuff and also the

1189
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:58,479
back producing stuff assumes that

1190
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:00,700
signals are always travelling linearly

1191
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,729
and as as as I've shown in the the

1192
01:05:03,729 --> 01:05:06,759
current density picture currents will

1193
01:05:06,759 --> 01:05:08,289
try and follow the path of the least

1194
01:05:08,289 --> 01:05:10,359
resistance which means it's not on a

1195
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:11,859
straight line which means inherently

1196
01:05:11,859 --> 01:05:13,839
that's the back projection method will

1197
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:15,819
never give proper results you'll need an

1198
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:17,859
algorithm which takes into account that

1199
01:05:17,859 --> 01:05:20,109
currents will curve and take different

1200
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:25,209
paths this uses the jacobian newton

1201
01:05:25,209 --> 01:05:29,109
gauss reconstruction which sort of takes

1202
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:31,269
that into your car without going into

1203
01:05:31,269 --> 01:05:34,738
the technical difficulties

1204
01:06:55,809 --> 01:06:58,809
mm-hmm

1205
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,340
now of course I also totally agree that

1206
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:15,010
this will not replace MRI machines in

1207
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:20,190
their contrast abilities and in their

1208
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:23,440
geometrical correctness and in their

1209
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,260
resolution but then again there is also

1210
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,090
a really big price difference in between

1211
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:34,210
them and I think this is a lot better

1212
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:37,570
than having nothing already and I don't

1213
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,940
think anyone has a personal MRI machine

1214
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,770
in their backyard but now you can have

1215
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:44,920
analog devices chips to do smaller scale

1216
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,250
experiments like this and I I do think

1217
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:52,090
that if we go to higher erase densities

1218
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:53,920
and if we go through the third dimension

1219
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,050
but you can also then do over sampling

1220
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:58,930
with and do better a reconstruction of

1221
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:00,640
the current densities American section

1222
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,560
of your properties I think we will be

1223
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,870
able to do a lot better and but it's

1224
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,700
it's not a replacement for the current

1225
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,400
image modalities and also think that the

1226
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,380
reason why it indeed like the first

1227
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,650
paper is like 30 years old but there

1228
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,990
hasn't been a lot of work going into it

1229
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:19,149
mainly because of that there are no big

1230
01:08:19,149 --> 01:08:20,979
companies out there investing into it

1231
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:23,560
because it's I also don't think there's

1232
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,210
a lot of commercial value in it it's

1233
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:28,240
mainly attractive for the texting you

1234
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,029
need like water in the lungs or for

1235
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:34,830
third world countries or

1236
01:08:42,809 --> 01:08:45,809
No

1237
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:53,260
yep

1238
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:58,520
so currently there are and eat like and

1239
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,929
the currently are a test being done to

1240
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,599
detect different types of brain damages

1241
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:06,089
in the ambulance because it's for

1242
01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:08,849
example if you have a cloth in your hat

1243
01:09:08,849 --> 01:09:10,500
then you'll need to get stuff that

1244
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,880
dissolves the cloth but if you have a

1245
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,698
bleeding in your hat then aggression

1246
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:17,849
yeah exactly if you have a broken vein

1247
01:09:17,849 --> 01:09:19,529
or being in your hat then you absolutely

1248
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:21,420
do not want to give stuff which makes

1249
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:25,408
your blood even less cloth 3 and time is

1250
01:09:25,408 --> 01:09:26,939
very valuable like time is literally

1251
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:28,469
your brain in that case if you have

1252
01:09:28,469 --> 01:09:31,139
brain damage and it's critical to make a

1253
01:09:31,139 --> 01:09:33,960
rough diagnosis in the end ambulance

1254
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:48,630
already mm-hmm actually current do pass

1255
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:53,219
through it but it's indeed it's no not

1256
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:55,619
only a panels there is a paper out there

1257
01:09:55,619 --> 01:09:57,239
and they even show that you can measure

1258
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:58,860
brain activity whether it's by

1259
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,980
functionally looking in time and then

1260
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:05,849
with a high resolution in the time axis

1261
01:10:05,849 --> 01:10:08,159
and then you can actually see that blood

1262
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,869
conducts very well because it has iron

1263
01:10:09,869 --> 01:10:14,179
in it and if you show people

1264
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,040
mm-hmm there are their irons in it that

1265
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:31,230
are in irons in it yeah mm-hmm yep okay

1266
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,969
if you want to be very precise that is

1267
01:10:32,969 --> 01:10:35,520
true but you can easily measure blood

1268
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,280
volume by measuring impedances and if

1269
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:41,850
you put in a task so you like make you

1270
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:43,920
show a visual stimulus to the to the

1271
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,360
back of your brain and you can measure

1272
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,739
the impedances you can actually see the

1273
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:48,570
response in the impedances back from

1274
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:51,350
your visual stimuli which is done in

1275
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,429
showing that you can actually measure

1276
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:59,340
the internals of your brain but it's an

1277
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:02,000
interesting discussion

1278
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,300
mm-hmm

1279
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:45,010
I do think so yeah I do think so and

1280
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:50,830
also they need to be made more better in

1281
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,900
terms of the altar calibrations that

1282
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,740
will need to be in place and also the

1283
01:11:55,740 --> 01:12:00,610
three-dimensional geographic mapping of

1284
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,530
them so in this case it's very simple

1285
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:05,410
because it's just a 1d circular plane in

1286
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:07,180
which distance are all equal but if you

1287
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,740
want to do an actual scan of your lungs

1288
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,480
or say your head then you'll just be

1289
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,220
placing some electrodes on someone and

1290
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:14,970
you cannot guarantee that there are in

1291
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,530
perfect position so you also need

1292
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:22,600
something for that cool well thank you

1293
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:27,240
very much for listening and I hope to

1294
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:31,420
show you some more amazing pictures soon

1295
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:36,630
[Applause]

1296
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:40,020
cool thanks

1297
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,340
you
