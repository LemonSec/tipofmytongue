1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:11,330
this is a beginner's training

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,300
presentation about network hacking so

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,150
its network hacking 101 I expect you to

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the basics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's an IP address but</font>

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,040
not we're not going to dive into packet

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,590
headers and stuff like that what exactly

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network hacking usually when there's</font>

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,640
discussion about hacking it's about

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,369
hacking a host a web server a database

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,230
or something like that and you connect

11
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:35,570
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server you try to fingerprint it</font>

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:39,529
to determine what exactly what kind of

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:43,039
host is it and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get in this</font>

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:48,010
presentation is about what can you do to

15
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,010
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the host comes to you</font>

16
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:53,660
this is a basic scenario you go to your

17
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,789
favorite coffee house you bring your

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,230
laptop you open up your<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop you've</font>

19
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,719
been there<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it auto connects to</font>

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:04,190
the network you open up a browser and go

21
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:13,490
to facebook com what could possibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:16,490
wrong so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit blurry what should</font>

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:20,350
happen you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Wi-Fi Wi-Fi</font>

24
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:24,829
works with probes and probe responses

25
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:28,070
you see an SSID yeah ssed sends out

26
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:30,320
probes you spawn to a probe you enter

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,389
the authentication and step which is

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,479
basically a very old step from the time

29
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:41,509
of web you enter the authentication step

30
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:44,719
you associate with yet and you have a

31
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:48,130
wireless connection that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,130
step after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

33
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,839
you need an IP address when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect</font>

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the Wi-Fi laptop doesn't have an IP</font>

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,759
address which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of necessary if</font>

36
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wish to communicate with a remote</font>

37
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:07,369
web server what do you do you try to get

38
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,619
one the basic mechanism for that is dhcp

39
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:14,610
dynamic host configuration protocol you

40
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:17,090
send out a broadcast to all the hosts in

41
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,290
the local network<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the local subnet</font>

42
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:24,690
destination MAC address all f's

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:29,940
broadcast and say who here hands out IP

44
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:35,250
addresses one or more service answer say

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:39,090
he is an offer that's also a message

46
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,860
that sends through to the client so well

47
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,350
here's an offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't happy address</font>

48
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,330
and some other settings for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

49
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">client might receive multiple offers</font>

50
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:53,160
which one does it take usually the first

51
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,049
one it's as<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple as that the client</font>

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,030
then request from that server yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

53
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,650
would like exactly that IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

54
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,540
if everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes well the services</font>

55
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,650
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledgement you can have it</font>

56
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:09,269
it's yours good your laptop now has an

57
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,579
IP address but it only knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> its IP</font>

58
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,280
address it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> received its default</font>

59
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,790
gateway it has received a dns server

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,160
personally smells of stuff now it needs

61
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,760
to resolve to name facebook so it needs

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">to access the dns server it's probably</font>

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,489
not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local subnet say you use</font>

64
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,200
google dns a dot 8 of 8 or 8 it's not in

65
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:36,030
the local subnet so you need to get out

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the local subnet next step ARP the</font>

67
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,450
address resolution protocol what is the

68
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,040
mac address that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to my</font>

69
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,078
default gateway with that matches my

70
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,720
default gateway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i send out a</font>

71
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:52,319
broadcast again layer to berk us to all

72
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,519
mac addresses in the subnet who has for

73
00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:01,709
example 192 168 1<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 if that's my</font>

74
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,200
default gateway please tell not 192 168

75
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,950
hundred fifty hundred fifty just an

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,850
example if you're lucky the default

77
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,829
gateway says this is the mac address its

78
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,079
unique us by the way from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market</font>

79
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,290
from the default gateway to your laptop

80
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and says this is it this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a P address</font>

81
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">lives at that particular mac address</font>

82
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:32,100
good now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know how to get off your</font>

83
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:33,960
local subnet next step dns the first

84
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,940
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you do is connect to the dns</font>

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:41,180
server www facebook com<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

86
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tour an IP address because my laptop</font>

87
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,580
doesn't understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> the material itself</font>

88
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,440
it needs an IP address so first you go

89
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,750
to the dns server to resolve the name to

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,900
an IP address and then you're able to

91
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,010
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server connecting to the</font>

92
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,109
server is as simple as well there's a

93
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,670
wire shark trace of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS etc this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

94
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">another website but the principle is the</font>

95
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:09,770
same a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns query a query response and</font>

96
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:13,680
then you're able to initiate a session

97
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:17,490
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything goes well you get your</font>

98
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:24,600
facebook i repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> what could possibly go</font>

99
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:26,430
wrong does this look familiar but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:32,010
photo so who don't know what this is

101
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:35,250
this is a fake Wi-Fi access point you

102
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is massive i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

103
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,700
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

104
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:48,619
this is all there is with this in a

105
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:50,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">9-volt battery if I go to a local coffee</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">smart little box contains what is called</font>

109
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,580
a yaw sagar remember when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just talked</font>

110
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:07,339
about the the Wi-Fi probes from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIDS</font>

111
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:10,580
when you open your laptop it sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

112
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:12,919
probes to all the SS<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids that has</font>

113
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,058
haven't ever configured on it so your

114
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:20,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">low</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here your home network you work a</font>

115
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:21,919
network you're the Friends Network were

116
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,519
you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it sends out</font>

117
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,469
probes what is smart little box us to

118
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,019
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those probes it is</font>

119
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:33,739
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have that you can connect to me</font>

120
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:36,139
now and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have auto connects</font>

121
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:39,229
switched on as well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

122
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,819
this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> box basically you connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

123
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:43,459
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little box and it will eat your</font>

124
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,619
credentials it'll also direct you to

125
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:49,909
this work to the website but it now it

126
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:51,579
has your credentials as well so this can

127
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:56,389
happen when connecting to the network

128
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:58,849
next step dhcp we just said you can have

129
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:01,240
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp servers in the network and</font>

130
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:04,938
the client usually picks the first one

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,389
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens if that other dhcp</font>

132
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:11,029
server isn't exactly friendly and tries

133
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,839
to redirect your traffic through our

134
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:17,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">host which can capture your credentials</font>

135
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:21,619
redirect you to malicious websites try

136
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:27,199
to load malware onto your computer it

137
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:30,860
can when you send out dhcp discover it

138
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,439
lands with possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proper dhcp</font>

139
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:38,479
server and a rogue DHCP server which

140
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:40,759
hands out a bogus or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the not at least</font>

141
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,308
not bogus not the official default

142
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,319
gateway but another host it can be

143
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:47,810
compromised house it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a house</font>

144
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,910
dedicated to capture traffic

145
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,830
and it performs a man-in-the-middle

146
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,500

have normal connectivity and for select

150
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,340

152
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:13,099

accomplishes that all traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

usually tries is connect to port 80 and

encrypted traffic

229

240
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">point to a port where your client is</font>

goes to or from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular port</font>

243
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,430
make a copy of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and send it out that</font>

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:36,130
frame that packet sends or receives also

247
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:38,500
quite powerful then there's things you

248
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,589
can do with routing you can if you have

249
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,500
control over the router you can route 88

250
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:48,250
a to some other subnet where you have a

251
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,700
bogus IP address or whatever you can use

252
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,470
routing as well to intercept traffic

253
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,000
there are many many more techniques but

254
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,010
I think there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other presentations</font>

255
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,190
today so let's not go too deep into them

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:06,910
countermeasures every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single attack we</font>

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,469
terms are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see by the way as a</font>

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,510
techniques I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what</font>

but some people it's it's not allowed to

358
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,770
hacking there are a number of tools for

all sort of intercept replay attacks

interception hacking crackling etc well

now we get to the end of the

oh okay sorry no wow sorry when you're

to use an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> network always delete</font>

373
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:17,490
your network would be in a great tip and

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:20,219
as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the ARP poisoning goes the men</font>

375
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:25,220
in the middle framework is one neat one

376
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,220
as well especially on UNIX environments

377
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:39,810
well these<font color="#CCCCCC"> days major sites like</font>

378
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:46,790
Facebook your gmail your banking use a

385
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:21,810
you can you can use the website so i

386
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:24,720
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of techniques are not</font>

to the smaller

389
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:34,959
you know a forum of or something that's

390
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,390
really an excellent example say you

391
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,030
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a forum your credentials get</font>

393
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:46,270
your forum profile and see you email say

394
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,070
for example it's a gmail address to be

395
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite honest how many of you use the</font>

how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it tells</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the rest of the world</font>

400
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:10,950
I think you have a reasonable chance of

401
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,870
at least half of the your your victims

402
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,130
use the same password if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

406
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,650
good point

407
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:34,110
and I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually tested this one</font>

408
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the for the Facebook example the SSL</font>

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,060

413
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,149
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communication between</font>

true so the major sites will work with

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the browsers to to tell like oh these</font>

421
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put in HB error HTTP header of</font>

422
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:32,280
your web server you can say oh yeah we

423
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,919
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand security on this domain</font>

424
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:38,610
or on the sub domain and the lifetime is

425
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,470
X and I yeah yeah so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

426
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,500
this off on our a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackerspace website</font>

427
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,910
Bitler NL which is the complete domain

428
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,320
all subdomains need to be strict

429
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,600
Transport Security and we just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

430
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,939
in the HTTP header and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

431
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,490
we actually cannot have any hosts on

432
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,860
ours on our domain and subdomains that

433
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:59,400
it has to be HTTPS which is a bit

434
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,050
annoying<font color="#CCCCCC"> but sometimes but without that</font>

435
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,780
that's that's one so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your hosting</font>

hosting a website then strict Transport

Security enabling that on your server is

438
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:15,960
quite a good thing might be annoying but

439
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,760
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very secure it is only very</font>

440
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently that the Dutch banks have</font>

441
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,540
enabled this because there has been only

442
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,920
if I think two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago or something</font>

443
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:28,350
there was some article some some some

444
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:30,420
some some Wi-Fi hacking things in the

445
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,860
media and then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the banks were</font>

446
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,650
like oh we have to enable this

447
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,120
stuff it might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea yeah the</font>

448
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,420
funny thing is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> partner was</font>

449
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,699
actually quite old but every few years

450
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:44,700
someone says hey we can use this to hack

451
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,560
into public networks etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> every few years</font>

452
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess some media attention yes yeah</font>

453
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:53,940
there are also two other points to hack

454
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:56,419
an HTTPS connection the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for</font>

455
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">example under lenovo laptops you get</font>

456
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:03,960
pre-installed root certificates with

457
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:07,790
private keys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could use that</font>

458
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,140
private key to talk plain as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cell</font>

459
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,360
completely secure to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser and it</font>

460
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,940
will say oh I know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> root certificate</font>

461
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,110
and it will just say I was completely

462
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,360
encrypted yeah yes some some computer

463
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,550
manufacturers deliver more including

464
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,969
many many extra

465
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:30,350
yes and there's also an interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

466
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:32,150
about around HD SD which is run an NTP

467
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:38,389
server as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say that it's</font>

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:41,300
suddenly<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2100 surprisingly high number</font>

471
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:56,570
headers again ntp has another issue I

472
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,220
have a son and the one that's here knows

473
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,990
about computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the other one knows</font>

474
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,910
about gaming and the one that knows

475
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,490
about gaming has some friends on 9gag

476
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:08,150
and they told him<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you set your</font>

478
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:19,670
will happen yeah and race and it works

479
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:24,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">so issuing a DHCP with ntp that has a 1</font>

office where they all have iphones yeah

482
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:32,180
did he also<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to charge the iphone in</font>

483
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,900
the microwave and when he did not cool

484
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:38,510
it with ice packs as well he came to me

485
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:40,490
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that certainly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a hang and</font>

486
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:44,510
after a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days he confessed that he</font>

487
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:51,130
actually said it in another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my</font>

488
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">other son was bullying in about it and</font>

489
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,670
learned a valuable lesson with the

490
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:59,630
expensive brick as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember in time</font>

491
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:03,140
yeah it took over two weeks to de charge

492
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:05,600
it because it will overheat and you need

493
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:09,590
to cool it actually to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the</font>

494
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:15,439
church and after a certain level it

495
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:18,250
won't d jarge so you have to use like

496
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,510
elastics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lego to push buttons to</font>

497
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,510
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the charge</font>

498
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:50,139
excellent yes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send it to</font>

499
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:52,970
apple they will fix it for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

500
00:26:50,140 --> 00:27:00,770
the boys about I believe the FBI is

501
00:26:52,970 --> 00:27:06,070
currently trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apple to about</font>

502
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:10,670
root certificate on the lenovo laptops

503
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:13,520
the thing about public key thing is is

504
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:18,670
that even if you have a valid

505
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:22,090
certificate the the browser will reject

506
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,090
reject the pallets

507
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:42,750
now yeah for the for google the the

508
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:45,360
google website yes but on a website can

509
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:49,890
send the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time its public key and</font>

510
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:52,169
tell the browser remember this and when

511
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:58,860
you come the second time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the website</font>

512
00:27:52,170 --> 00:28:09,810
and the key is<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchanged then it will</font>

513
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:12,360
simply reject it yeah thats the sir but

514
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,370
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> anti p clients only accept a</font>

515
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,889
certain amount of deviation and 100

516
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:19,939
years is almost certain more than what's

517
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,940
usually acceptable

518
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:29,599
interesting standard

519
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:46,330
oh let's wish that they well regarding

520
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:48,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NDP I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is because the MTP</font>

521
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,340
has an option<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows a larger step</font>

522
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:53,200
on the first star of the demon so when

523
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,810
it first starts up it allows a large

524
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,060
step this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably to correct for</font>

525
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:00,460
broken system clocks or non-existent

526
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,440
Hotwire clocks something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

527
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,900
when it boots up it will accept any time

528
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:14,350
you get it later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it will only accept</font>

529
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:18,130
small steps so how about ipv6 security

530
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,770
because your example were only ipv4 only

531
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,570
legacy IP that's true<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

532
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,430
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only network hacking 101</font>

533
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:27,909
perhaps a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation next</font>

534
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:30,400
year well I can now see a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

535
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:36,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of three attacks for</font>

536
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:39,400
example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP and the ARP spoofing</font>

537
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old broadcast techniques ipv6</font>

538
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,340
doesn't have any broadcast its<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

539
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,210
multicast so you have to have some

540
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,840
different kind of attacks you can

541
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:52,660
basically copy it you have to reinvent

542
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,270
it for ipv6 you can of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your</font>

543
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,800
rope at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACP server member of the</font>

544
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:59,470
correct multicast group but then again

545
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,790
there are usually security configuration

546
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:05,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">switches in order to prevent that so</font>

547
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:09,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">while one of the one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

548
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:11,590
it I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> success is the possibility to</font>

549
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:16,720
send rogue router advertisements which

550
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:17,800
is very common<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hard to be yeah</font>

551
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,780
because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of hardware that</font>

552
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> support security for this like</font>

553
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:25,300
the older switches that that's a bit

554
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,340
problematic that but they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there like</font>

555
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:32,320
switches and Wi-Fi gear out there that

556
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:34,840
can do the that's featured a call it a

557
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,610
router advertisement guard which is

558
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,149
basically like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an access list that's</font>

559
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,350
looking at the icmpv6 traffic and the

560
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,779
flags that are in there so that

561
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:47,709
basically saying all every

562
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:50,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">ralph theismann of error every IP 6 ipv6</font>

563
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet that is sourced by users with</font>

564
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:55,059
these kind of flags that will be dropped

565
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:57,129
so that it's for the for the networking

566
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:59,499
vendors it is pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to implement</font>

567
00:30:57,129 --> 00:31:01,928
but there are there's almost no support

568
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:03,669
in there yet so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also another</font>

569
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:05,769
attack which you could do is that just

570
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:08,379
go on like a Wi-Fi network and start

571
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:09,759
broadcasting rogue router advertisements

572
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:12,789
and then there were also result in

573
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,859
clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting your IP 6 addresses and</font>

574
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:18,309
get sending you traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> because more and</font>

575
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:23,759
more websites like Facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> our v6 now</font>

576
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:23,759
so so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a major major issue</font>

577
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:31,478
and most public Wi-Fi spots don't

578
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:33,580
actually have ipv6 so if you start

579
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:37,440
broadcasting there's ipv6 here their

580
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,439
client will accept an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ode upgraded</font>

581
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:43,779
personally I prefer my Wi-Fi a client

<font color="#E5E5E5">that should help prevent it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's faculty</font>

00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:08,859
probably have techniques probably even

592
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:11,399
better but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd not sure what I call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tory</font>

even<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists</font>

594
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:25,250
any more questions one thing about the

595
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,750
you were so mention about the open

596
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,770
networks that you have to be very

597
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:33,170
careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that if you have a wpa2-psk</font>

598
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:36,860
network that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as less secure</font>

599
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:39,470
as an open network because if you yeah

600
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:45,679
we I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week we were with with</font>

601
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:48,140
with honest with the yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so</font>

602
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,240
like like like his camera had a piece

603
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:54,500
quenette were a few scale network and it

604
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,930
was in wireshark with your interface

605
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,260
monitor mode very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to decrypt</font>

606
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:04,700
the wpa2-psk packets because if you know

607
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:07,580
the psk and you capture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> WPI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so for a</font>

608
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:11,300
handshake you can get do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key</font>

609
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,290
derivation to calculate the session key

610
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,740
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could just equip</font>

611
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,740
everybody's traffic so that's also a

612
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:25,100
yeah yeah so that and yeah so that's

613
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,920
also also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

614
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,159
can fix your security with<font color="#E5E5E5"> BSP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cade and</font>

615
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that works for</font>

616
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,020
Wi-Fi for for proper encryption is 82

617
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,179
annex which could be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a pain to</font>

618
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">set up but that's the it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

619
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,700
proper way to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi scared not not</font>

620
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:52,400
many people use a radio service at home

621
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:55,420
I do well no further questions I'd like

622
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,420
