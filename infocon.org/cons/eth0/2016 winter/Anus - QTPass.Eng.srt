1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,230
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> kewt paws let's first start with</font>

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,359
passwords and password managers

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,390
passwords suck like as it says on my

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,240
laptop fuck passwords seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuckem</font>

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,039
but unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are still stuck</font>

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,659
with passwords lots and lots of

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,330
passwords especially if you work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:28,210
web company with lots of different

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,240
clients and shit you got this tree

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,520
structure of folders with projects like

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,070
designs and shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there and usually</font>

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's also a dot password file or</font>

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,329
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all the credentials for</font>

14
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:43,620
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connected Facebook</font>

15
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:46,989
account or whatever you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want those</font>

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,788
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want those at a couple of</font>

17
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:50,709
previous companies I worked we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> such</font>

18
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:54,819
folder structures mostly even on a samba

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,709
share or something terrible we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

20
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:59,530
change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for the developers it</font>

21
00:00:56,709 --> 00:01:01,239
was easy we thought there's an open

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,280
source solution for that it's go past

23
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,039
the standard UNIX password manager and

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,250
it works really nice it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you get a</font>

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,280
tree structure of folders with files so

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:16,210
you can go past projects whatever

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,950
company name site etc put the files are

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,300
the passwords in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there works in the</font>

29
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:26,320
command line it uses just a bit of bash

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:29,770
get 3g PG and that's it it encrypts the

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,720
passwords with<font color="#CCCCCC"> gpg and also multi</font>

32
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">recipients so you can share your</font>

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,450
passwords with your group you're not

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,190
stuck like in keep us with a single

35
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,050
master password for the whole tree

36
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,570
structure because well every folder can

37
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:47,500
have separate stuff it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice but</font>

38
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,479
then we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem managers even if</font>

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,090
you make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy like this managers</font>

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,670
can't use terminals or at least they

41
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,440
claim that they can't use terminals so I

42
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,880
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking out what the fuck what do</font>

43
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:03,690
we do so I came up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> two nights of</font>

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,610
work I made a very simple read-only

45
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:10,060
implementation of a GUI for it and the

46
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:12,239
Beamer is a bit shite for this but it's

47
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,120
the same just<font color="#CCCCCC"> this tree structure and</font>

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,830
this is read-only the adhan edit buttons

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,800
we're in there at start

50
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,560
and you can just read the passwords and

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,240
the managers seem to like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot so</font>

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,100
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> two nights of work I thought yeah</font>

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,710
well that's fun let's put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on get up</font>

54
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,690
did a short hackathon did a couple of

55
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,470
translations for it that kind of stuff

56
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:40,329
and well that was nice but then it got

57
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:43,600
popular we've now got over 190 stars on

58
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:48,340
get up and lots of people contributing

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,190
like 30 ish so all of a sudden I was

60
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,410
kind of done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but at Easter I got</font>

61
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,660
a pull request from someone putting the

62
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,150
edit and add functionality in there and

63
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,700
then we go talking like okay so what's

64
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,350
missing and what is not very handy with

65
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:08,980
boss and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user management</font>

66
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:11,920
every folder you can have for every

67
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,840
folder you can set the recipients so who

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:22,238
can decrypt these files it uses gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> gpg</font>

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,730
so it uses multi recipient encryption so

70
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,769
everybody in that list can decrypt but

71
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,350
the list is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical there's no</font>

72
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:32,470
nice interface for it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a text</font>

73
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:36,910
file with<font color="#E5E5E5"> gpg IDs so that's really sucky</font>

74
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:40,019
and we thought up a nice interface hey a

75
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:44,040
list and look who's there renault oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

76
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,600
have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> g PG so i can encrypt for you</font>

77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,570
well no I can't because I haven't

78
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:53,709
trusted him<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gray</font>

79
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:56,950
color says only the blue ones are usable

80
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:59,650
you have to trust them the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gpg trust</font>

81
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,500
model doesn't allow you to encrypt to

82
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:06,459
people you don't trust which kind of

83
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:11,650
makes sense we added<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

84
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:14,769
options and recently templating so

85
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:19,269
people can even easier make even easier

86
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:23,470
use of it also with editing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

87
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,930
nice and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah the enthusiasm of people</font>

88
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:29,710
really helped me to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> some more effort</font>

89
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,180
in it one day I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for the</font>

90
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:36,729
ferry in Amsterdam and

91
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:38,440
one sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a issue so they wanted to</font>

92
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,380
clear the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password display after some</font>

93
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,850
time and while on the ferry I explained

94
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">to him how to do that and the next</font>

95
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:54,190
morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a pull request he</font>

96
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,940
implemented it so that was nice recently

97
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,430
someone also send a pull request and

98
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:04,479
after a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work it was merged for</font>

99
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:08,470
using icons on the buttons and not just

100
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,659
icons but system dependent icons that's

101
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,000
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like in katy that's what</font>

102
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,840
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like in Nome and that's what it</font>

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,930
looks like in a dark KDE theme whoo but

104
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,659
yeah that doesn't work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

105
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:25,960
unfortunately which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a slide</font>

106
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,050
4 so we had to add SVG icons and a lot

107
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">of stuff but recently we've also got</font>

108
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,870
some other news and that is huh we're in

109
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:40,810
debian testing currently so that's

110
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:43,389
pretty nice and so yeah in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

111
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:47,919
release of debian ubuntu you name it

112
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:51,370
mint it's just up get install in arch

113
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,909
linux there is a pecker an hour built

114
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:58,440
for it to actually one from the gate and

115
00:05:54,909 --> 00:06:04,690
a one of the versions versioned versions

116
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:10,240
so that's pretty useful um well for more

117
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">information go to get up or go to QT</font>

118
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">pasa dork any questions</font>

119
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:24,590
which like this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your boy no it's</font>

120
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,810
even worse we did a release<font color="#E5E5E5"> party for</font>

121
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,840
the one point<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 release and during that</font>

122
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,210
party a friend<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mine brought his wife</font>

123
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's Chinese she did the Chinese</font>

124
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:41,180
translation for Cutie pass and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese</font>

125
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:43,540
rich person benefactor of Debian asked

126
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:48,040
for Cutie pass to be included<font color="#E5E5E5"> and found</font>

127
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:51,170
found a booty call<font color="#E5E5E5"> a maintainer for it</font>

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:54,980
so that was pretty nice yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

129
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,960
really a cooperative thing also anybody

130
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,970
doing an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source project I can</font>

131
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,090
advise to just take an arbitrary date

132
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,280
and do a release like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one point 0</font>

133
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:08,060
release for us it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

134
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,530
because august first 2014<font color="#CCCCCC"> i send an</font>

135
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,020
email of the alpha version to the

136
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:16,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">mailing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list of passwords stored so</font>

137
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,419
pause and then I thought well since

138
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,690
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going good why not just take</font>

139
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,330
august first 2015 as a 1 point 0 dates

140
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,130
and so for the 2.0 release I know the

141
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:32,780
date<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> August first</font>

142
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:35,480
this year any other questions yeah the

143
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:39,380
first version did also<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with GE or</font>

144
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,200
just files it worked with gpg of course

145
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,600
it because well pass works with gpg and

146
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,300
it was just a reader for a read-only

147
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,940
version for managers to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font>

148
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:59,450
our passwords we as developers put in

149
00:07:49,940 --> 00:08:02,210
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice yeah yes how do you</font>

150
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,979
explain to managers how gpg works or how

151
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,570
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you let them create our keys because</font>

152
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think that's still a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

153
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,590
well this is a nice solution if you have

154
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,650
a key but also for email and two other

155
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:15,650
extents yes unfortunately I don't have a

156
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:19,460
screenshot of it but the first start I

157
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:21,620
can now look it up after this but when

158
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">you first start QT pasa and you don't</font>

159
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a GP g brief key it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open a</font>

160
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:31,469
short wizardly thing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow</font>

161
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,020
to enter<font color="#E5E5E5"> your name and your email and</font>

162
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:37,110
press ok and have a spinner for like

163
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,900
five minutes while<font color="#E5E5E5"> it generates your key</font>

164
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,729
and then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it then you can use</font>

165
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,439
that and a nice thing because they enter

166
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:50,220
their work email of course if you set up

167
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:53,370
gpg tools for example Oh Mac or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATPG on</font>

168
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux alone windows or whatever it will</font>

169
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,920
automatically encrypt emails force

170
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,069
people you have a private key for and

171
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,040
sign for all the rest well like magic

172
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,810
nice so that works we got all the

173
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,699
managers sending encrypted emails

174
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:13,949
without them knowing now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a nice</font>

175
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,110
benefit you know it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not letting</font>

176
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,200
them lose the keys on a reinstall or

177
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:26,280
anything like that but you got a long

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:30,480
way yes thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this yes Dolph</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hi</font>

179
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:35,819
I once started to use QT paso try to use

180
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">pass first and but what what I what I</font>

181
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,950
saw was that you order everything in the

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,890
folder structure mm-hm and in the end

183
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody can't see you your passwords</font>

184
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,939
but they can see what size or how you

185
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,660
structure your stuff so if you have like

186
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,100
20 porn sites for example yep then

187
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody can see you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody who</font>

188
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,990
has access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your laptops or your</font>

189
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,780
browser history anyway etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see</font>

190
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,940
your project yes true also<font color="#E5E5E5"> please don't</font>

191
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,920
put it on a public get server but a

192
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,060
private get server like you do with all

193
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,640
your projects etc probably of course but

194
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,109
if somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> has access to it it doesn't</font>

195
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">even have to have my password you can</font>

196
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,640
still see the the greased the list of

197
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,280
clients the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of projects that I know</font>

198
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,720
what you look for your hands yes there's

199
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,480
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussion on the password</font>

200
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,880
store mailing list about this and it is

201
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,060
decided that it will completely break

202
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,260
the whole idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of past to decrypt or</font>

203
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,050
encrypt the tree structure or whatever

204
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,960
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it monolithic instead of</font>

205
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,790
easily version about cetera it's just

206
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">not worth the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effort to try and</font>

207
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,140
appreciate

208
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,120
the tree structure because why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

209
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,449
and you lose the tab completion on the

210
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,459
command line also yes because it really

211
00:10:51,450 --> 00:11:03,990
is a very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of bash scripts</font>

212
00:10:53,459 --> 00:11:05,790
that the main pass executable<font color="#E5E5E5"> II people</font>

213
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,430
are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that there's a project</font>

214
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:12,390
called pw which is the very simplified

215
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:14,069
version of pass and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's i think they're</font>

216
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,459
thinking of implementing something like

217
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:21,149
that with a just yeah random number<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

218
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:23,849
hashed tree structure with a file which

219
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:26,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to encrypt for everybody</font>

220
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,899
who can use the tree which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also hard</font>

221
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,149
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out because per folder you can</font>

222
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,270
have different users and that tree needs

223
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:39,390
to be decrypted by everybody so yeah it

224
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:44,060
has a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> downsides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay any more</font>

225
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,060
questions well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your time</font>
