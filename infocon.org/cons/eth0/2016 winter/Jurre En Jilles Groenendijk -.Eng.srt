00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,860
hello everybody my name is Sheila swoon

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:12,850
and Ike and today we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:15,820
you about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arduino and it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:18,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Yura and I'm going to tell you about the</font>

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:25,150
raspberry pi and not that kind of

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:28,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">raspberry pi a different one okay this</font>

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:32,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">meet my wife and my twins Yura has an</font>

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:36,100
identical twin brother not fully

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:38,230
identical he's not the kicking one so we

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,590
have a problem at home if we do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,690
netflix we are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be cold yes</font>

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:48,550
because yell is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to solve that</font>

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:51,099
one it started off with a class at

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,919
school plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> close and that's something I</font>

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,070
did because I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was not okay</font>

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,800
that year was reading The Rock's all day

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:04,239
so I started a plus close to give

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:08,820
children extra inspiration and I didn't

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:12,190
for four years I did stuff like

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,039
exploding<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cola Mentos fountains but I</font>

21
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,620
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do special stuff as well so we</font>

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,500
went outside and look for the ferns<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:28,150
see how compression was initiated but

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:30,310
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> day I thought of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grandpa in the</font>

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's my father me and twin boys</font>

26
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:36,520
and he has made a special box for me

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:42,549
with like the flat battery foreign her

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:46,090
fault bells lights and sockets and that

29
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:48,490
inspired me more than any education<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

30
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,850
followed after that so I wanted to

31
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:54,280
create something just as inspirational

32
00:01:51,850 --> 00:02:00,100
as the box that my grandfather made for

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:02,380
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is what I came up with at</font>

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,610
that time the Raspberry Pi was released

35
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:10,538
so I create a box have the Houma I saw a

36
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:12,110
nice place of 30 by 30 from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 120 x 60</font>

37
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:17,279
plate

38
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:20,220
used Pringles can a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raspberry Pi display</font>

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,160
a printer here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is actually it has a</font>

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,330
coin acceptor which is area over there

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,299
it I can sense six different kind of

42
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,150
coins and the children could connect to

43
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Wi-Fi network create some Python</font>

44
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,980
scripts to have done anything and it

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,890
itself could connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the school</font>

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:46,670
network to obtain Wi-Fi which you needed

47
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:50,880
to install packages Raspberry Pi was

48
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:53,429
initiated at least with<font color="#E5E5E5"> David</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> braven and</font>

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:58,019
David<font color="#CCCCCC"> braven is the one responsible for</font>

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:01,140
elite this old flight<font color="#E5E5E5"> simulator game and</font>

51
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:05,070
recently he created a new one danger

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,290
elite dangerous a very nice game and it

53
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:11,730
also works with oculus rift if you if

54
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:15,179
you like the Raspberry Pi comes in

55
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,190
different shapes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and models there are</font>

56
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,570
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones like the a and the B</font>

57
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:24,709
model which have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet more USB ports</font>

58
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:30,660
and over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have some</font>

59
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:36,440
improvements this one now has the the

60
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:40,440
two version and which has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quad core</font>

61
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:45,150
but the latest<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is 20 and I run into</font>

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:48,359
a guy in Japan who created<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raspberry Pi</font>

63
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:54,330
cluster board and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's currently using</font>

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:59,100
it to use 16 Raspberry Pi<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeros in a</font>

65
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:01,590
cluster situation and I is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to set</font>

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,970
up an IndieGoGo because case Kickstarter

67
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:08,280
was so hard from from Japan this is the

68
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:12,630
Raspberry Pi it's basically a computer

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,370
to enable children at school to work

70
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,969
with computers and not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that</font>

71
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have to type stuff in words but have</font>

72
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,620
to program and install your own

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,040
operating system so it's a basic

74
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,250
computer the

75
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,280
can be powered with your phone charger

76
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,700
which can hold your operating system on

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">your camera card and which can connect</font>

78
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,440
to a television<font color="#E5E5E5"> for screen so this is</font>

79
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually all you need if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the</font>

80
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:47,469
other devices except for all the things

81
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just got it also has a GPIO header and</font>

82
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,800
that's something that a year will come

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,980
up to later because it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

84
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,830
bridge to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino it has pins which</font>

85
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:04,480
you can use to trigger stuff and that

86
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,210
was actually what I need for my box the

87
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,970
Raspberry Pi can be set up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

88
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways so you can do it either the geeky</font>

89
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:16,810
way with the command line interface but

90
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:21,880
you could also<font color="#E5E5E5"> just download media</font>

91
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:25,690
center and just run it out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box so</font>

92
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:30,270
either like that or like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I prefer</font>

93
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:35,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">character-based myself this is the GPIO</font>

94
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:39,250
bus and the GPIO bus has digital pins so

95
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,560
you can either sense if something is

96
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,550
switched or not or you can trigger a

97
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:50,710
light it has no<font color="#E5E5E5"> analog functionality but</font>

98
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,780
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bus i square C bus and that</font>

99
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,989
verse enables you to connect multiple

100
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:02,669
devices like for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance analog-digital</font>

101
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:05,920
converter or a screen or<font color="#CCCCCC"> lat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or multiple</font>

102
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:10,610
buttons and if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> here this is a</font>

103
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:14,810
special chip this allows you to

104
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:20,240
at 16 extra lights or buttons to the box

105
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:22,729
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've used a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those if you</font>

106
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,150
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect that you yourself you</font>

107
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:28,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">just need this is like a pin header</font>

108
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:33,948
which with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cable connects to a</font>

109
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:38,599
raspberry pi just power the device at

110
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:41,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the clock to it and you</font>

111
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:45,949
have a command on your Raspberry Pi to

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:50,080
see what channel 77 in this case has the

113
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:50,080
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to it with the</font>

114
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:58,849
library that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want another thing is</font>

115
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:03,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has cereal but it does not have</font>

116
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:06,770
like rs-232 serial it talks transistor

117
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,669
to transistor logic and the Raspberry Pi

118
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:14,810
uses 3.3 volts for communication so you

119
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:18,500
have a console cable to your Raspberry

120
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:22,250
Pi and Arduino depending on the model

121
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,659
talks either 5 volt or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 33 volts and you</font>

122
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,009
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the stuff you buy</font>

123
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:30,860
communicates in the right level

124
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:34,490
otherwise you have to shift the levels

125
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,580
and this is an ftdi friend which

126
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,319
actually connects to the Raspberry Pi

127
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,080
and creates a serial port<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

128
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:46,310
computer so this allows you to talk with

129
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:51,589
a raspberry pi on the serial bus now

130
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:53,689
over to my son<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok hello I'm your neck</font>

131
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:58,360
and I'm going to telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you something</font>

132
00:07:53,689 --> 00:08:01,639
about Audrina EXT two devices a

133
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">mindstorms ev3 and another we know who</font>

134
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:07,039
know they basically serve just about the

135
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:11,150
same purpose but exceed the price tag is

136
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:16,039
slightly different um they both have

137
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:19,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own I abort the AV tree has full</font>

138
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:23,740
input ports i can send like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sensor</font>

139
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:26,000
that a bush<font color="#E5E5E5"> tens or ultrasound sensor or</font>

140
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,710
something else on any other side you can

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,320
put a motor or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the excess</font>

142
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,020
power this really is full because it's

143
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost unbreakable but it's also limits</font>

144
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:40,189
your your capabilities where do we know

145
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:44,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh No however it has 16 digital ports</font>

146
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,640
and four or six six analog ports sorry

147
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,449
which can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for both input and</font>

148
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,880
output<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really useful because you</font>

149
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possibility too but it's</font>

150
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,380
also way more breakable which we'll see

151
00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:02,930
in a few slides next are doing itself as

152
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:06,650
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different models for some for a</font>

153
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:10,250
CD<font color="#CCCCCC"> Diggy Spock which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally prefer</font>

154
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:14,300
because of the price and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug and</font>

155
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,670
play it works directly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also do</font>

156
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:22,180
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the multi car with Wi-Fi</font>

157
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:22,180
or enough things really useful

158
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so here we have a little example of</font>

159
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:32,640
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> arena card it has a few sections so</font>

160
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,490
we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup part which is run once</font>

161
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,380
which in this case you define the pin as

162
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,580
output because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be powering</font>

163
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:44,130
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have the loop which will</font>

164
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,470
repeat itself forever in this gate is

165
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,240
says like Turner<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on wait a second</font>

166
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,230
turn it off wait a second and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font>

167
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,140
blink here we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another example of</font>

168
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,089
input which again in a set of you say

169
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,600
hey I'm input and in the loop you can

170
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:02,310
check if the button is depressed now if

171
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,700
you were just connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five holes</font>

172
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,529
and input it would basically work but

173
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,740
for come for you upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong card</font>

174
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:13,470
you know um and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll say this is output</font>

175
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,480
it'll send power do an output and your

176
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arduino will back you just fry instead</font>

177
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,820
we have all your money so that's why you

178
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,339
should have another ground pin connected

179
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,399
so that whenever something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

180
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:30,300
happens it will send<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to power to</font>

181
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,300
the ground here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another example</font>

182
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:38,819
which is both input and output this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

183
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:42,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">get Knight Rider example and yeah let go</font>

184
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,160
works is the same again I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

185
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:49,199
come with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now but it's quite</font>

186
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting yeah that's not a really</font>

187
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,570
useful feature to the biggest it's

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,260
a keyboard so i can plug it in and it

189
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:01,709
will start doing stuff i perfectly use

190
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,950
it a lot to spend my friends or get a

191
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:06,449
lot of come on at the same time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

192
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,440
quite funny to throw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can also</font>

193
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:12,140
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to for example hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open up a</font>

194
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,490
google chrome page open up facebook

195
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:20,970
updates data to hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gay now and yeah</font>

196
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:27,790
that would actually work and now we are

197
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:31,780
you another example I let go together

198
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:34,719
a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> lab both by the biggest park again</font>

199
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,150
and a distance and so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a so sorry</font>

200
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,190
whenever y'all via handle something else

201
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,410
over the district<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center it will start</font>

202
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,850
changing colors and when you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey I</font>

203
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,420
like to go you can take away your hand

204
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:50,830
and it will stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> that color until 13 dot</font>

205
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:54,550
37 seconds it will go back and again

206
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:58,080
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all powered by this tiny little</font>

207
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,079
chip did they get walk

208
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,740
here we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another example this one</font>

209
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:16,850
uses the digi<font color="#E5E5E5"> x</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let bolt</font>

210
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:16,850
right there yeah

211
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,670
so you can connect it up and it will act

212
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,820
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless access point and they can</font>

213
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,079
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that web address and then there's</font>

214
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,420
an input field in which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can input</font>

215
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,339
detect which will then be changed to

216
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:36,699
whatever your input it was a really fun

217
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:36,699
project to make and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonderfully</font>

218
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you were to combine a few of these</font>

219
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">things so that we know some software few</font>

220
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:51,589
sensors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a breadbox you can get</font>

221
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:54,439
something amazing like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

222
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:59,389
device which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to copy my skills</font>

223
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:03,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">axis forces for the lockers its fate</font>

224
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:08,630
it's built up by a sensor with NFC

225
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:11,149
battery pack some other shields LCD and

226
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,730
when we try to build if we ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

227
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:17,839
few problems so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem was</font>

228
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:20,509
that um the software of the scanner we

229
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,389
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> would whenever it's sent something</font>

230
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:27,410
would say the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> dough bites are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 x</font>

231
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:30,790
08 to make sure that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't actually</font>

232
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:33,819
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for any malicious purposes and</font>

233
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:38,420
second problem was that the cove we used

234
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:42,649
later in the linux loss which<font color="#CCCCCC"> um not</font>

235
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:46,819
allow anything which which was the 0

236
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:49,160
block so like the first two bits of well

237
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:52,670
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hero they can be used with</font>

238
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,300
malicious intent of well so go to self

239
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,550
wouldn't a lot up we found some fixes

240
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,639
for this we bought a another scanner

241
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:04,339
which working USB we bought some

242
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:18,290
specific tag which could actually be

243
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:20,509
written sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a che um so we</font>

244
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,920
got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech which were zero sector</font>

245
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:24,500
writable so you could actually write the

246
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">first a bit on that and we also started</font>

247
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,130
programming in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux and that worked</font>

248
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,769
like a charm so now instead of my path I

249
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,290
just have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> arafat known everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

250
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:38,470
fat bag on my keychain which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

251
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">unlock my locket which is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

252
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:44,660
I do this all for Michael and I'm I'm

253
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:49,250
doing lately I'm a white hat or pink

254
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:51,500
attacker and what made some deals with

255
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,220
my headmaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright whenever I find</font>

256
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,050
something I'll report it directly to him

257
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,880
not alas<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else and he gonna</font>

258
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">fix it and I'll get a reward for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

259
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,490
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't gotten any yet but</font>

260
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,899
I've taken thing or whatever I've done

261
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:11,990
that after reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> this book it's got</font>

explains the basics of responsible

264
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:20,510
disclosure with a lot of example which

265

how<font color="#CCCCCC"> like instructions Sylvia talk make a</font>

279
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:27,240
show she made it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Obama in his</font>

280
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:33,240
garden to make a printer that used a

281
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:39,390
water paint to print stuff geek girl

282
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:42,120
diaries she used to make stuff Sylvia

283
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:47,040
Tata first make stuff for younger

284
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:52,200

289
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:14,730
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> so go and visit their website another</font>

290
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:20,639
one is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one the Arduino basic</font>

291
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:22,679
connections by<font color="#CCCCCC"> pickax and it has a nice</font>

292
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,510
repository of all kinds of different

293
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">circuits so if you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know a</font>

294
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:30,090
specific circuit if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar</font>

295
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:33,390
with electronics you can just get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

296
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:36,990
hand on it connect a ps2 keyboard to not

297
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:42,510
we now connect a vga<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an Arduino</font>

298
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:51,300
switch to dirty fourth power do whatever

299
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:55,110
you like I work on a makerspace<font color="#CCCCCC"> zent</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ARMA 2 for anything radio something yeah</font>

301
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:05,010
radio amateur and we have a link page so

302
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:09,120
www.eddecosta.com inner links there they

303
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:11,460
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all bundled so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their links to the</font>

304
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,659
girls in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and some shops i</font>

either you or me just fire it off yeah

308
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,500
thank you

309
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,710
as you showed us a picture of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> recipe</font>

310
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,719
by cluster could you give an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

311
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:44,980
what that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used for and not yet</font>

312
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,320
I heard someone for fussing applications

313
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,530
that could be one the guy itself build

314
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,530
it for provisioning USB sticks so we

315
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:58,550
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the USB side more than at</font>

316
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:03,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network currently they USB cluster</font>

317
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:08,270
board has a lot of network interfaces

318
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:10,639
and one of the people online instructed

319
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:13,730
that if you use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a special</font>

320
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,510
realtek chip you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just switch it on</font>

321
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:20,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the board itself and you only have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

322
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:23,179
network cables for clustering so you do

323
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:27,470
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> need an extra switch to power up the</font>

324
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:30,710
board but yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that uses be</font>

325
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:35,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">wolf cluster can be done on there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

326
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:42,800
very interesting thank you it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very</font>

327
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard for him to obtain the 1600 bundled</font>

328
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:50,510
with their raw speed Mach with a

329
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:54,200
magazine and the you they currently

330
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:57,050
created 800 more but they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a</font>

331
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:01,250
lot more people want those five euros

332
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:03,678
for for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer it lacks a network</font>

333
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,500
interface by find all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

334
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:12,109
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of purpose for it</font>

335
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:15,979
anyone else that's quite clear done

336
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:15,978
okay thank you very much
