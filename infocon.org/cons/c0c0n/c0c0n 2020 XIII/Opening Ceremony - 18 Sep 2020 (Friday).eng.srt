3
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,119
good morning

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:34,000
in the present times the buzzword is of

5
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:37,040
hygiene with hygiene cyber hygiene

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,800
in the background of kovit 19 there has

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,559
been a total

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,160
restructuring of the systems we live in

9
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,640
our educational systems the way we work

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,480
the way we live has all gone to the

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,440
digital platform

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,398
it's in this background that cocoon has

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,079
come out

14
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,520
with its 13th edition 2020.

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,920
on a totally virtual platform now many

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,400
of you will think it's a climb down

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,159
from the usual grand conferences that we

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,640
hold

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,360
but we need to understand that this

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,600
conference

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,799
in the virtual platform has various

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,439
advantages

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
that makes it truly global the reach of

24
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,639
this conference

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
apart from being seen by all the

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,840
delegates attending this conference

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,119
is being beamed live on all our social

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,600
media handles

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,280
to 4 million people around the globe

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,158
which makes it one of the biggest

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,720
conferences

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,600
in the history of cocoon so this

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,880
conference

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,240
is basically a matter of history for us

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,520
and for you all let me take this

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,000
opportunity

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,720
to welcome all our friends to this

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,680
cocoon 2020.

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,439
2020 has been a very different year for

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,280
all of us

41
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,398
one cyber expert has remarked that 2020

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,479
has a virus and we need to reboot it

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,880
it's a very important year a very

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,600
different year for all of us

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,239
coming back to 2020 in the post

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,440
corporate

47
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,040
arena when the dependence on digital

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,599
resources have increased

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,280
we have vulnerabilities developing in

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,280
cyberspace

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,599
we have cyber criminals trying to sell

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
the statue of unity

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,480
we have people trying to redirect

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,480
donations to the pm cares fund

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,480
there has been policy efforts to flatten

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,518
this cyber crime curve

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,399
but it has yielded no results security

58
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,680
flaws

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,599
in video conferencing apps like zoom etc

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
has highlighted the importance of cyber

61
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,959
security

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
not only in our offices but in our homes

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,280
also

64
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,399
now cyber criminals operating on the

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,720
confusion and fear created by covid

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,720
have really indulged in a lot of cyber

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,359
crimes which has become a challenge

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,440
not only to individuals to enterprises

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,319
but to law enforcement officers like us

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,879
also

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,319
riding on the fear and confusion created

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,120
by kovid

73
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,640
we had cyber criminals coming in with

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,200
fake websites

75
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,720
stealing data we had a lot of bank

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,640
frauds coming in

77
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,720
we had a lot of crimes against women and

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,599
children which really affected the

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,640
society

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,238
in a very adverse manner we even had

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
drove states coming in

82
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
and attacking the national digital

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,319
resources trying to destabilize

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,560
different countries

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,159
we also had attack on health care

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
particularly in the wake when the health

87
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,720
department was facing

88
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
facing the core with patients but all

89
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,239
this proved

90
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
that all our sectors all our digital

91
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,440
resources

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,280
are under attack the new ransomware

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,640
attacks have increased not only in

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,480
complexity

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,958
but also in its nature also ransomware

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,920
was earlier limited to enterprises but

97
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,040
now we have

98
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,280
attacks in the homes also and it has

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,079
become so complex that even the online

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
backups

101
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
these cyber criminals are trying to

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,840
encrypt

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,159
it's very clear that cyber crimes is

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,200
getting more technical more complex

105
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,480
and the gravity of the crime is manifold

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,760
increase we can easily conclude that the

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,399
complexity

108
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,159
and the intensity of cyber crimes has

109
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,679
gone up drastically in the last six

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,479
months

111
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,080
now the question arises how do we deal

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,840
with this situation

113
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,639
are we ready to adapt to this new

114
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,119
situation new challenges

115
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,759
firstly we need to secure ourselves the

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
individual

117
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,800
the enterprise the government entity all

118
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,880
three need to secure themselves

119
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,759
using the various for us euros the

120
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,040
various systems available

121
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,840
secondly we need to develop a resilience

122
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,280
if we are attacked whether we are ready

123
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,198
to bounce back

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,479
whether we have the system in place

125
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,680
where we can actually

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,000
counter that attack whether we can be

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,880
we can be resilient to that attack and

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,600
come back bouncing the same way

129
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,520
the third is of course whether the law

130
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,960
enforcement agency in that particular

131
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,120
country

132
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,320
has the resources to detect this such

133
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,479
crimes

134
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,400
because many a place we know this crime

135
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,919
is a crime without borders

136
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,599
and it's very difficult for a law

137
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,440
enforcement agency or the police

138
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,720
department to actually crack into these

139
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,960
crimes

140
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
so we need to put up systems in place

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,560
where we can actually have the

142
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,599
cooperation of different agencies

143
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,479
to crack and detect such crimes in this

144
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,479
context

145
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,680
we need to remember another important

146
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,520
fact the factor of costing

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,960
because in the coved arena and the

148
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,880
postcovid world

149
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,880
we will find that costs are going to be

150
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,440
cut not only in the private enterprise

151
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,240
but also in the government

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,440
among all these confusion there is an

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,000
opportunity also for all of us

154
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,520
we actually need to pick up a robust

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
cyber system

156
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,560
not only in the government in the

157
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,919
private sector also

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,600
which will face and equip us to meet the

159
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,240
challenges of the future

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,479
even when covet becomes a dream these

161
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,680
systems will remain which will help us

162
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,880
in the future digital world now many of

163
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,440
you may be wondering

164
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,400
that i am painting a very dismal picture

165
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,319
of the present climate

166
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,400
what is the most important thing is to

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,600
remain optimistic

168
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,359
because what covett 19 has shown us

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
is the importance of coordination and

170
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,880
cooperation

171
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,960
in the present times the government

172
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,639
agencies the private sector

173
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,960
and the security experts have come

174
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,560
together to meet the challenges of the

in tune with the present day reality

355

where the kovit 19 pandemic

356
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:18,000
has convinced us that being

357
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:21,439
virtual is the new normal

358
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,440

on the social media handles

364
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,600
so as to reach more than

365

2 million people

is being organized in the backdrop

369
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:06,400
of the changing times and

370
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:09,599
no novel practices in human life style

371
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:14,319
the way we work live

372
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:18,958
and carry out business has changed

373
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:22,959
and the changes remind us that the world

374
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,079
is not going to be the same in the post

375
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,079
covid era

376
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,880
at the same time the new

377
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,000
normal has also opened up

378
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:40,200
a world of opportunities

379
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,039
overhauled existing systems

380
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,480
re-engineered our business

381
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,840
policies and change the basic

382
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,039
models of policing

383
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,000
mostly with the help of digital

384
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,000
technologies

385
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,720
sometimes opportunities come

386
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,400
in the form of adversities

387
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:12,160
like unprecedented threats

388
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,960
attacks and crimes in the digital world

389
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,600
we are aware that while the right

390
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,440
thinking

391
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,360
people silently endured the

392
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,640
impact of the lockdown there were many

393
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,559
others

394
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:34,240
who were busy hacking into the systems

395
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:38,799
stealing data and money

396
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:42,000
harassing victims children and women

397
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,520
and trying to destabilize our

398
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,919
digital systems i am

399
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:53,840
happy that kerala police continues to be

400
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:57,360
in the forefront of the battle

401
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,799
against these disruptive forces

402
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,280
in the cyber space by

403
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:09,520
connecting pioneers from all the domains

404
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:13,280
in the iit industry and

405
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,400
of technology for the betterment

406
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,399
of society

407
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:25,200
i feel that cocoon 13

408
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:28,200
is an ideal platform to hardness

409
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,320
the collective efforts of all

410
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,440
stakeholders

411
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,678
in cyber space by

412
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:40,960
highlighting the importance of five peas

413
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:44,640
cyber security that is

414
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,679
political leadership press

415
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:52,559
police and public

416
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:55,600
and private sector the synergy

417
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,799
among these groups will

418
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,399
certainly help to make our

419
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:06,158
cyber space more secure

420
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,360
and safe

421
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,760
i understand that this conference would

422
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,199
have

423
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,039
around 60 sessions on

424
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,640
four major security domains

425
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,080
and other attractions like robotics

426
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,559
village

427
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,678
hardware and software exhibition

428
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:33,120
this initiative points

429
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,400
to the unwavering commitment of kerala

430
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,399
police

431
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,840
to effectively target the emerging

432
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:47,200
challenges and to ensure

433
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,199
a truly secure digital world

434
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,640
i hope the various sessions

435
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,760
would enrich the knowledge of the

436
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,799
participants

437
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,080
and make them more equipped

438
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,400
and more effectively placed

439
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,280
to deal with the technological

440
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,919
challenges

441
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,918
of today

442
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:16,000
it is through such enhancement

443
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,280
of capabilities that kerala

444
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,400
police would march ahead

445
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,158
polite but firm

446
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,280

and have been blessed with many travels

486
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,760

as you can see the only one that i

495
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,240
haven't visited

496
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,240
is your country

497
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,879
although i'm not an expert on security

498
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,879
and hacking

499
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,960
i can tell you that because of my

500
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,200
background

501
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,600
most of my family members who were kings

502
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,960
and queens of countries

503
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:08,000
were in the habit to use the services

504
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:11,679
of their prospective security agencies

505
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,640
one anecdote was that my grandfather

506
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,679
prince paul

507
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,360
the last regent of yugoslavia would use

508
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,240
intelligence to understand what was

509
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,959
going on

510
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,559
in the country but he did not use

511
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,120
intelligence

512
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,480
against the british embassy since he

513
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,279
considered britain as friends and ally

514
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,000
unfortunately for him it was the british

515
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,279
embassy that

516
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,159
organized a coup against him to have a

517
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,919
change in policy

518
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,600
and had he put the embassy at the

519
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,440
surveillance

520
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,840
he would have known what they were

521
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,080
plotting but he didn't

522
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,320
this is to show you the importance of

523
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,039
intelligence with everyone

524
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,360
no matter what you think will happen or

525
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,360
not

526
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:06,400
my great uncle king alexander

527
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:09,840
of yugoslavia was warned

528
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:13,440
not to go on an official visit to france

529
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:17,279
in 1934 and also to wear

530
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,799
his bulletproof vest he brushed aside

531
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,400
those demands

532
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,000
saying that france was a friendly

533
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:28,880
country and he felt at home there

534
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,919
sadly he was assassinated a few hours

535
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,039
after his arrival in marseilles

536
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,039
in the south of france

537
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,200
as i said i'm not an expert

538
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,880
but i'm a user of technology like many

539
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,120
of us here

540
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,640
and although i am from the older

541
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,678
generation

542
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,919
which saw the rival of the computers i

543
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,720
have some knowledge

544
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:58,480
not as much as our children to whom

545
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,480
everything looks so easy

546
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,760
as a background let me tell you

547
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,600
that they have been in business for the

548
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,559
last 40 years

549
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,199
where i helped my office double its

550
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,279
assets

551
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,279
under management to over 3 billion

552
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,039
i then moved to switzerland where i

553
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,439
developed

554
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,240
the services of a global business

555
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,880
intelligence company

556
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,279
formed by former members of various

557
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,919
security services

558
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,480
this is where i got some understanding

559
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,240
about

560
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,039
intelligence deeper the world

561
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,159
we live in right now is smaller and

562
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,840
smaller

563
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,840
and it is full of obstacles

564
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,200
before covet 19 it was very easy to

565
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,639
travel

566
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,039
and we almost did that too much

567
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,840
we used to take airplanes like some

568
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,320
people take a bicycle or a taxi

569
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,120
for meetings that were not always

570
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,120
justified

571
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,080
now thanks to covet 19 we have been

572
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,840
discovering the ease of video

573
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,120
conferencing

574
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,399
like now through

575
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,120
cell phones and computers

576
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,520
we have been doing too much

577
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,918
digitalization

578
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:25,360
with all the risks that come with it

579
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,480
the good things before were that when

580
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,120
you travel

581
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,520
it was so that you could see people

582
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,520
there was a reason to meet with them

583
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,440
you could engage in personal relation

584
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,360
you could understand the person you were

585
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,039
meeting

586
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,719
you could assess their character

587
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,679
you could visit their factories you

588
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:52,080
could visit their offices

589
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:54,080
now with those digital meetings online

590
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,120
you don't read so well the people across

591
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,639
from you

592
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,639
and you can be fooled by them

593
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,279
that increases the risk of being robbed

594
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,480
with the multiple use of emails

595
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,760
messaging

596
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,559
electronic communication the sending of

597
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,760
documents electronically and so on

598
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,000
the risk increases and it is a paradise

599
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,360
for

600
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,039
hackers there are no more secrets

601
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,039
since everything is digital

602
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,080
before when you traveled you were

603
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,840
prepared you were organized

604
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,879
and you knew what to look for

605
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,158
now in this electronic age

606
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,880
everything is different i can give you

607
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,279
some examples of hacking

608
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,200
where you are with your client online

609
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,120
sending emails

610
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,120
and suddenly you get an email which you

611
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,439
think is from them

612
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,520
in which they give you a new banking

613
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,279
account

614
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,200
this is a red flag it should raise your

615
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,120
attention

616
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,000
but because it is in the flow of the

617
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,559
email conversation

618
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,279
you might believe it is for real and

619
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,879
then you will

620
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,840
send money to this new account

621
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,120
and many chances eight will be lost

622
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,760
unless you react

623
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,320
immediately digitalization

624
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,760
might save a lot of kerosene up in the

625
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,439
air

626
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,600
time for yourselves or even

627
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,200
rediscovering your own country

628
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,199
because of travel prohibitions

629
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,678
however even the focus of it

630
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,960
hacking both from private and public

631
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,240
institutions

632
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,320
was the new frontier sport

633
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,840
you will all agree that this has not

634
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,039
been decreasing

635
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,439
instead it has boomed up

636
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,840
getting into competitors mobile phone

637
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,919
agenda

638
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,559
emails messaging service

639
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,000
even the one who sells you end-to-end

640
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,360
encryption

641
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,360
is more and more widespread

642
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,159
not to speak about the use of these

643
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,919
capacities

644
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,919
by states services

645
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,520
in the meantime the travel bans and

646
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,720
mandatory

647
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,520
on paper quarantines have increased the

648
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,000
need

649
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:29,279
of fake documents authorizations

650
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:34,320
corruption logistical services

651
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:36,480
and so on without any formal control

652
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,600
the world has become more insecure than

653
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,279
it was before

654
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:45,840
of it and created more discrepancies

655
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,840
between the rules and their applications

656
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,919
example the massive need of

657
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:58,240
ppe or personal protective equipment

658
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:01,919
goods have also seen the global markets

659
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,760
trying to adapt in emergency mode

660
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,159
to these new digital standards

661
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,000
buying goods in asia to sell them in

662
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,039
latin america

663
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,080
using companies based in hong kong

664
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,519
singapore the united states

665
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:23,120
luxembourg or switzerland and banks

666
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,840
in france in the uk in the us

667
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,199
have opened the doors to massive fraud

668
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,840
in all

669
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,399
and every bit of the business chain

670
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:37,678
canada germany italy

671
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,760
switzerland just to name some of them

672
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,039
have been tricked with fake ppe

673
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,840
deliveries

674
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,240
which are face masks gloves gowns or

675
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,799
jails

676
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,519
many companies all over the world have

677
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,480
completed

678
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,080
massive investments to start ppe

679
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,000
production lines

680
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,199
and having the trusted partners in

681
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,559
countries

682
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,880
like china brazil or canada

683
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,799
not even to guarantee to speak to the

684
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,559
right persons

685
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,440
and this does not happen only in china

686
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,559
some of our partners found that their

687
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,919
thermometers

688
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:19,760
manufacture in canada was a po box in an

689
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,760
abandoned warehouse in ontario

690
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,399
you must be careful payment conditions

691
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,760
are monetized at

692
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,799
every stage fake lois

693
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,840
letters of intent are sent without any

694
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,918
verification

695
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:39,120
because of the emergency and the greed

696
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,559
fabricated proof of fund letters

697
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:46,080
pofs and bank comfort letters

698
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,600
sometimes very sophisticated are used to

699
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,639
secure stocks

700
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,279
and productions without paying a cent

701
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,559
and especially without the possibility

702
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,919
to have any clue

703
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,480
of the end buyer let me tell you an

704
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,080
example

705
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,720
last week a partner of mine received

706
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,000
a pof to check for an operation

707
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,159
involving

708
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,360
billions of face marks

709
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,840
the bank letter very professionally done

710
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,479
showed the name of the account holder as

711
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,240
jeff

712
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:24,080
bezos and the available liquidity over

713
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:27,360
50 billion dollars

714
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,120
but we've seen even funnier ones one of

715
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,199
our clients

716
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,320
was dealing with a very reputable

717
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,919
company

718
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:40,240
in the us and they received an loi

719
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:43,600
a bank letter and when they looked at it

720
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,000
everything was fake the bank they were

721
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,240
using did not exist

722
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,960
and the country in which this bank was

723
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,200
did not exist either

724
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,679
in this case they were very lucky

725
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,320
because the documents looked perfect

726
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,320
but because the hackers made such a

727
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,918
ridiculous presentation where

728
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,519
everything was fake it was easy to spot

729
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,040
but sometimes it is not

730
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,040
sometimes it is very well done

731
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,760
most of the time the chain of brokers

732
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,000
the urgency and the intercultural

733
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,200
attitude is benefiting more to the

734
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,560
fraudsters

735
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:27,439
and hackers than to the real business of

736
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,799
ppe supply

737
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,000
however it is the open door to grab

738
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,119
emails phone numbers do social

739
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,960
engineering for hacking money laundering

740
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:44,879
fraud or even political purposes

741
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,879
anything but selling or buying ppe

742
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,639
and this is growing as all threats are

743
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,079
growing

744
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,200
