hi i wanted to welcome everyone

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,920
to the cook on conference um and this

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
this topic is about ransomware threats

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,120
and how they've gone up

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,479
uh during the discover 19 pandemic

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,038
situation we are in

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,880
uh my name is santor srinivasan i'm a

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,720
senior director with flex

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,359
formerly known as flextronics and i take

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,919
care of globality services and id

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,920
compliance

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,800
so as you can see all these headlines um

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,920
and and some of them are in the u.s some

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,320
of them in india

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,680
and most of these are very recent and

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,640
these have happened in the last couple

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,719
of months

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,160
right the carnival clue cruise line got

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,440
hacked um

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,319
in the us and and data got exfiltrated

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,800
uh privacy data a customer data right

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,000
passport data et cetera got explicated

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,919
and uh garmin right garmin basically a

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
lot of their key systems got encrypted

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
databases got encrypted

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
so their websites were offline for about

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,440
uh

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,799
or the key applications right i am a

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,000
garmin user

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,320
and my watch wouldn't or

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,400
my app wouldn't connect to their cloud

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,559
application for about five or six days

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
right they were completely knocked out

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
and uh

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,759
and and the rumors they ended up paying

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,960
the ransom for five million plus

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,040
dollars to uh to get the decryption key

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,559
and get their systems back online

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,840
uh quickly uh then you talk about the

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,400
u.s liquor

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,920
giant this is jack daniels it was hit by

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,799
a ransomware attack and there is some

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
talk about

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,320
a dealer getting exfiltrated over there

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,240
also

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,839
i think some of them paid the ransom

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
some of them didn't and they use their

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,640
backups to restore their systems and

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
come back online

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,320
and in a lot of cases it depends what

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
data got exfiltrated

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,439
right and what's the exposure to the

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,520
organization which

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,520
which decides if you pay the ransom or

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,920
not

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,840
then on the indian context you have

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,479
these articles in india

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
which basically are basically stating

59
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,439
that the ransomware attacks have

60
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,280
gone up in india and and there was a

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,160
survey done by sophos

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
uh with some indian organizations and 82

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,640
percent

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
these organizations said that they were

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,119
hit by a ransomware attack in the last

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,120
six months

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,319
and a good percentage of them ended up

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,520
paying the ransom

69
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,000
right um and and you can see in the last

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,920
attack

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,120
and fast article it basically says

72
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,879
ransomware attacks

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,360
and they double in the june quarter

74
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,440
right so in this uh

75
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,959
basically dashboard what you're looking

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,760
at is basically

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,319
number of ransomware attacks have have

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,518
gone up

79
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,160
right by 44 right

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,000
and uh the number of malware attacks

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,599
have kind of come down by about 60

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,720
but ransomware is on an uptick all right

83
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,839
and here you can also see that india

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,040
has been one of

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
the countries that have been uh heavily

86
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,400
attacked

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,400
in the asia pac region right

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,599
here what are the different attack

89
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
factors

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,920
you can kind of see that rdp compromise

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,720
seems to becoming a

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,238
favorite uh in in this pandemic

93
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,519
situation because

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,840
a lot of organizations in response to

95
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,200
uh trying to get their employees unable

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
to work from home

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,440
uh they used rdp to get their employees

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,640
enabled

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,159
and to work from home and uh because we

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,958
were in a lockdown situation you

101
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,959
couldn't send

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,040
send assets home and the only way you

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,239
could do something remotely was give

104
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,480
them access to

105
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,760
the desktops in the office right and you

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,280
ended up turning

107
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,920
rdp on in some cases insecurely

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,000
and and that has become an attack vector

109
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,319
and exposure to the organization

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and which is being compromised now or

111
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,518
hackers are leveraging it to compromise

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,720
your organization

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,000
right um and you can kind of see the

114
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,640
uh rdp compromise vector is kind of

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,480
on the upswing the average ransom

116
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,759
payment in q2

117
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,959
was at about 178 k which is a 60

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,400
b from 111 k that an

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:28,080
organization was paying in q1

120
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,400
right so it seems a lot of more

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,000
organizations are ending up paying up

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,239
um in this case and and and that

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,360
is uh something for organizations to

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,320
think about saying are they going to

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,440
manage this

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,680
going forward right and a lot of the

127
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,719
attacks uh data got exfiltrated as you

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,400
can see

129
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,199
uh that is something that the

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,159
the hackers are looking as uh act as

131
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,040
insurance

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
saying they exfiltrate and then leak the

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,440
information

134
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,400
in and to just uh

135
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,360
ensure that the organization pays up

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,799
right

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,960
so uh going forward what

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,360
is the anatomy of a ransomware attack

139
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,960
this is your typical kind of ransomware

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,520
attack which is random

141
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,239
in nature or that hack attacker just

142
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,919
sends

143
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:23,199
a phishing email to a bunch of users

144
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,639
and and some some someone clicks on it

145
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,160
basically and and basically the malware

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,639
unpacks and executes

147
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,400
on that user's machine and then it

148
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,759
basically talks back to the command and

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,840
communication server

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,120
downloads the public key and then

151
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,320
encrypts the data

152
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,800
on that user's machine right and

153
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,560
basically then the user and then you see

154
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
the ransomware screen which says how do

155
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,440
you communicate

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,280
with the hacker and pay what is the

157
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,639
ransomware of ransom that you need to

158
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,080
pay to the hacker

159
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,560
right so then you you store to

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,479
purchase bitcoins and feed the hacker

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,199
and then he delivers the key

162
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,919
and with which you use to decrypt your

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,560
data

164
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,758
and recover from the situation right now

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
uh in an advanced ransomware situation

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,160
what you're seeing

167
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,359
is um you know organizations are

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,600
using uh hackers are typically uh

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,720
to get initial access they're using rdp

170
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
brute force

171
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,919
they're looking for vulnerable internet

172
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,720
facing systems or weak application

173
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,799
systems

174
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,400
to get their initial access then they

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,720
engage in credential theft

176
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
using all these different methods then

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,759
they

178
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,719
move laterally within your organization

179
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
using

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,240
these different tools cobol strike or

181
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,520
these management tools

182
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,400
that you use to manage your systems

183
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,240
or like tools like ps exec which are

184
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,840
quite prevalent in the windows

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,800
environment right so once they

186
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,679
laterally move then they create new

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,639
accounts

188
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,319
change group policy leverage shadow id

189
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,520
tools schedule tasks

190
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,880
register services and and then the

191
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,318
payload gets downloaded

192
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,560
right on these systems and then executed

193
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,560
right

194
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,560
uh continuing what you also see is

195
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:20,080
uh basically uh this

196
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,720
is your spam emails um and you basically

197
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,719
see

198
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,240
the malware gets installed as i

199
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,599
mentioned in the earlier slide

200
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,840
uh credential gets stolen you escalate

201
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,240
privileges

202
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,440
to uh to be an admin user move laterally

203
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,960
within your organization

204
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,520
recon active directory uh delete

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,198
backups and at this point also

206
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,359
exfiltrate data

207
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,240
all right so this gives you multiple

208
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,360
insurance you can't restore from backups

209
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,240
there's data already leaked out

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,240
and and then you basically disable

211
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,560
protection on security products

212
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,800
then you deploy the malware in this case

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,840
it's the roof malware

214
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,000
right so um

215
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,119
when you kind of think the traditional

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,199
recommendation was

217
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,560
make sure you got backups back of back

218
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,800
backup right

219
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,160
and now you're realizing backups

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,520
probably can't protect you

221
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,560
if the backups get deleted or something

222
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,758
has happened so

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,240
how do you recover right

224
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,199
so what has changed it's no longer

225
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,440
random

226
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,960
it's uh targeted ransomware is the new

227
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,560
normal

228
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,000
so it's it's basically they target an

229
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,120
organization

230
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,320
identify which people work in that

231
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,560
organization

232
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,320
uh linkedin is a good way to identify

233
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,799
what kind of systems they use

234
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,320
what vulnerabilities are there on the

235
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,000
systems or applications that the

236
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,720
organization uses

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,720
um and and use traditional ways of

238
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
social engineering or your brute force

239
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
attack

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,720
to get on to that organization network

241
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,680
and in addition to phishing

242
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,200
and uh other methods to kind of get your

243
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,040
malware dropped into there

244
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,640
and to the augment into your victims

245
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,839
network right

246
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,920
so um attack is no longer just encrypt

247
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,200
data the exfiltrate data so this is

248
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,959
additional insurance

249
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,480
for the hacker now um in in addition

250
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,518
that one you are down uh your system is

251
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,080
encrypted

252
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,560
now your data is also exfiltrated so

253
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,480
there is risk of leakage of information

254
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,920
right intellectual property customer

255
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,040
data uh

256
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,880
or employee privacy data is is

257
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,959
exfiltrated out and there is a risk of

258
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,720
exposure of this information

259
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,160
backups no longer provide adequate

260
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
protection right

261
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,519
and i mentioned that in the earlier

262
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,319
slide

263
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,959
most of the time you're using online

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
backups

265
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,479
right and disk space backups and there's

266
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,880
a possibility that if your primary

267
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
data has got encrypted and potentially

268
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,600
your backup data is also going to get

269
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,839
encrypted

270
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,800
right so um in in addition to having

271
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,399
online backups organizations really need

272
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,640
to start thinking about

273
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,079
having offline backups to tape on some

274
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,720
periodic basis

275
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,599
and keeping them off site et cetera so

276
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,360
they

277
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,240
in in a worst case situation you can

278
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,079
restore from tape and get your data back

279
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,360
right uh risk of exposure sensitive data

280
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,760
has gone up as i've

281
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,800
talked about earlier and in addition to

282
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,800
potential downtime

283
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,120
so what can you do right

284
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,600
have an instance response plan which

285
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,200
which covers a ransomware scenario

286
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,880
um organizations need to be really clear

287
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,480
what are they going to do

288
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,959
around paying ransom right um make sure

289
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
you talk to your legal teams uh make

290
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,279
sure

291
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,519
i'll have a common understanding of what

292
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,959
you are going to do if a ransom has to

293
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,920
be paid out

294
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,359
right also in a lot of cases you're

295
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,479
going to work with a third-party

296
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,680
organization

297
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,920
to negotiate with the hacker and

298
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,519
pay the ransom so make sure those

299
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,880
arrangements are in place

300
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,320
right and and you have

301
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,160
this documented somewhere user awareness

302
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,079
the user

303
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,360
social engineering is typically targeted

304
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,040
at your end users

305
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,560
and it's a one it's one of one of the

306
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,760
vectors to get on

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,719
the organization network make sure

308
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,240
that uh you've got appropriate security

309
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,920
awareness trainings

310
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,399
for your employees and you make them uh

311
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,360
knowledgeable about phishing and social

312
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,360
engineering

313
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:45,600
and the do's and don'ts right

314
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,440
also if you do end up becoming a victim

315
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
of a ransomware attack then what do your

316
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
users do

317
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,319
who do they reach out to in the security

318
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,519
team right

319
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,320
um and and what do they do with their

320
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,639
systems

321
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,399
right a lot of the a lot of times there

322
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,000
is

323
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,160
the employee might just shut down the

324
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,040
system right and then you're going to

325
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,160
lose

326
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,000
the ability to do a forensic analysis so

327
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,680
you probably want to make sure that your

328
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,240
users know that

329
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,519
in in the event of a ransomware attack

330
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,800
situation

331
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,360
unplug your system from the network or

332
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,800
and and and don't shut it down or just

333
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,519
hibernate your system

334
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,000
right instead of powering it off right

335
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,399
uh

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,240
have a good endpoint security posture

337
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,279
here make sure you have an anti-malware

338
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
preferably

339
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,639
a behavior base that can detect and

340
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,639
protect against

341
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,800
ransomware attacks right um

342
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,639
and uh restrict privileged access at the

343
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,479
end point right and this

344
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,560
probably in this work from home

345
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,160
situation there is a tendency for your

346
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,040
sys admin to say

347
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,719
on your desktop admin to say hey i can't

348
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
this user's sitting at home

349
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,880
there is a possibility that he is going

350
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,800
to get disconnected from the network

351
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,120
so how does he log into that system and

352
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,359
do something so there is a tendency

353
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,959
tendency to say let's give an ad give

354
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
admin access

355
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,560
to that person since he's sitting at

356
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,000
home and and

357
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:16,000
so this now what it does is

358
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,240
the um the ransomware the malware runs

359
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,320
in the context of the logged in user

360
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
he's got admin access your problems just

361
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,120
multiply

362
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,079
right so ensuring that

363
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,680
uh access is controlled at the end point

364
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,680
is really important

365
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,599
make sure your systems are adequately

366
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,120
patched and that includes your operating

367
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
system and applications

368
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,560
on a timely manner security patches in

369
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,000
particular

370
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,560
um backing up uh endpoint

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,839
uh critical data right make sure your

372
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,959
data gets backed up on a predefined

373
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,160
frequency and

374
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,279
if in the event uh your user machine

375
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,399
does get

376
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,040
uh encrypted then you can restore from

377
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,600
backups

378
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,279
right and recover the data right you can

379
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,199
restore the system and recover the data

380
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,160
after that

381
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,359
um implement a good anti-spam and a url

382
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,000
scanning solution

383
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,160
yes you're gonna your users are trained

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,279
in and not to click on certain things if

385
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,120
they do click

386
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,880
one you don't want the bad emails to

387
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,920
show up on a user's mailbox

388
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,959
so make sure you filter them out

389
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,240
and if if they do show up

390
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,239
i have a url scanning solution where if

391
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,360
it's basically scanning for malicious

392
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,160
urls

393
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,199
right and it's it's basically uh

394
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,760
cleaning them out

395
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,000
if something malicious is coming in onto

396
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,680
your user's mailbox

397
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,360
segment your network to slow down the

398
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,479
spread and to protect key infrared

399
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,720
applications

400
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,160
uh if it's your shop flow network put

401
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
them on a different

402
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,240
uh separate them probably using a

403
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,920
firewall

404
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,920
or leveraging

405
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,279
so segment then segment them out

406
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
so that if your corporate network gets

407
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,199
in

408
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,839
infected then it's not spreading into

409
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,079
your

410
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,360
shop floor environment and shutting down

411
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,160
your operations

412
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,839
right so segmenting and ensuring you're

413
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,480
controlling what traffic goes between

414
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:19,360
these networks is important

415
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,560
at the same time if if there is

416
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,800
certain key systems which hold privacy

417
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,040
data maybe segmenting them out

418
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,079
also kind of helps but slows down the

419
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,719
spread

420
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,160
and you make sure these systems are not

421
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,880
compromised that easily

422
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,160
right so network segmentation probably

423
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,839
helps you

424
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,759
in controlling the spread of the virus

425
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,800
or the malware as it goes through

426
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,000
network

427
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,880
uh identify third party ingress ingress

428
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,160
into your network and restrict access

429
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,240
based on need to know

430
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,600
make sure they don't just get complete

431
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,160
access on your network

432
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,079
and they can get anywhere right so they

433
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,120
just get access to what they need to

434
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:02,160
and that's it so restrict access

435
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,680
right um and uh

436
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,519
and review and enhance monitoring

437
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,800
controls to detect ransomware

438
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,160
so if if if it does come on your network

439
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,399
uh it is important that you detect it

440
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,240
quickly and shut it down quickly

441
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,079
and so that it doesn't start spreading

442
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,000
all over your place so have adequate

443
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,959
monitoring controls to

444
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,440
um to detect a compromise and to shut it

445
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,560
down quickly

446
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
right so in this slide so what do you do

447
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,439
right

448
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,279
in terms of response uh rules and

449
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,040
responsibilities have a good

450
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,839
uh process in terms of who does what

451
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,399
during an incident response scenario

452
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,240
right

453
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,720
in this case your ceo chief operating

454
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,839
officer is responsible for discussing

455
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,079
liability with the insurance with the

456
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,480
lawyers uh

457
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,800
what uh key account damage control

458
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,160
prioritizing your response delegating

459
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,839
outsourcing in terms of uh if you need

460
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
additional search capacity all these

461
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,680
systems encrypted need to rebuild all

462
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,959
the systems from scratch

463
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,039
and and so so you need to take some

464
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,640
decisions over there saying how

465
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,720
and you need an incidence response

466
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,000
provider who's going to do the forensic

467
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,919
investigation

468
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,799
and detect what how much potential data

469
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,760
has been

470
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,199
uh exfiltrated right and what is the

471
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,959
level of compromise

472
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,360
so that is is the ceo ceo respon

473
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,559
c chief operating officer responsibility

474
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,719
sales and marketing

475
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,120
responsible for communications there's

476
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,160
just a guideline right so for your

477
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,760
organization

478
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,000
you'll need to develop something this is

479
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,039
just kind of a

480
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,400
sample right outbound communication

481
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,600
to clients inbound from clients uh deal

482
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
with external

483
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,000
uh third parties press etc and all

484
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,360
communications need to be approved by

485
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,320
the ceo and the lawyer

486
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,240
so that you're not creating any legal

487
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,439
situations for your organization

488
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,960
technicians or the it teams uh lockdown

489
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,320
affected systems

490
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,280
um investigation and forensic gathering

491
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,720
uh recovery planning vendor coordination

492
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,480
and how do you get back to regular

493
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,840
services

494
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,600
right um and in this case

495
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,360
it's it's like you see your checklist

496
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,678
what does what do you do

497
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,639
right uh gold delegate and run

498
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,840
interference

499
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,480
uh assess the damage how wide

500
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,439
widespread is the attack is it ongoing

501
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,080
you need to pull the

502
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,440
plug on your network on your tools

503
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,840
temporarily haul support

504
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,880
delegate triage outreach to affected

505
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
customers

506
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,000
uh be aware of regulations and

507
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,799
requirements zipper

508
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,600
gdpr etc who do you need to communicate

509
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,918
out to

510
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,039
and because you have breach notification

511
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,000
guidelines

512
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,720
um and just get on your phone with not

513
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,799
just your

514
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,960
clients but to all these different

515
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,120
people which we talked about earlier

516
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,080
right make sure you have a story
