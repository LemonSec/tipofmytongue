i've had i have about 20 plus years of

95
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,200
experience in this

96
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,760
in the business world as a cio

97
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,280
when kobet hit us in february march of

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,159
2020

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,439
we all jumped into action to try and

100
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,599
understand

101
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,599
what was really happening and how do we

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,679
continue the work

103
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,200
that our employees needed to perform for

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,799
our customers

105
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,880
so the first thing that happened was to

106
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,519
try and get everybody online

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,600
making sure our car employees our

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,720
partners our customers

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,759
are all sharing information online the

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
way we work

111
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,520
had dramatically changed from working

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,120
primarily from within our offices

113
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,280
to working from anywhere

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,400
some work from home some have shifted to

115
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,880
working from

116
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,599
uh extended along with their extended

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,000
families

118
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,720
but we all have to live and work in a

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,080
very

120
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,120
different world today employees are now

121
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,120
working from multiple devices

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
they used to work in a very secure

123
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,000
environment inside the office

124
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
and now they are working in an

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,919
environment that

126
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,320
is going to be in a relatively unsecure

127
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,560
home

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,759
network so it comes with it

129
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,800
significant challenges data protection

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,919
cyber security and all of them we also

131
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,720
had to shift

132
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,240
to working more on the cloud you

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
couldn't really access

134
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,639
all the systems that were on-prem so we

135
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,880
had to move a significant number

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
of them or accelerate that movement to

137
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,919
the cloud

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,840
and provide access to systems that were

139
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,198
protected inside the four walls of our

140
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,560
offices

141
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,000
into the cloud or making them accessible

142
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,479
from anywhere technology

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,520
which was an enabler now becomes the

144
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,320
mainstay of a business environment

145
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
the way we work had dramatically changed

146
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,320
the way we live

147
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,320
has also significantly changed think of

148
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,039
every aspect of our lives

149
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,880
every aspect has significantly changed

150
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,520
but what did we do as cios

151
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,479
literally overnight literally over a

152
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,479
weekend

153
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,520
we started to enable the entire

154
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,639
workforce

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,318
to be able to work from anywhere

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,680
wfh working from home or wfa working

157
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,639
from anywhere

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,520
became a mainstay word in the in the in

159
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,520
the business jargon

160
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,520
quickly instituted measures to maintain

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
business continuity

162
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,880
and these are things that we do as in a

163
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,680
business world we are ready

164
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,800
but nobody is ever ready for something

165
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,680
like this this was like

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,160
world war iii in a completely different

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,400
paradigm

168
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
we wanted to provide remote access to

169
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,239
systems

170
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,319
over private networks that have

171
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,280
increased our very increased trained

172
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,680
loads

173
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,039
and we're constantly monitoring the

174
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,599
spiking of these

175
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,479
workloads and also to maintain and

176
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,039
ensure

177
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,080
the threat levels are mitigated and

178
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,159
protected against

179
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,599
new cyber security threats that have

180
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
evolved or

181
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,960
that have sprung up over the last two

182
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,039
quarters

183
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,120
the new world and this continuing risk

184
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,400
had significant changes

185
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,280
right what is the new normal the new

186
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,039
normal

187
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,479
was everybody started to work from home

188
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,680
54 increase in spike not just on how we

189
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,719
work

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,160
but there was a 54

191
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
increase in spike in comb cooking 22

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,840
percent

193
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,120
spike in inc in home improvement because

194
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,119
people are spending

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
more and more time at home so they

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,280
needed to make their

197
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,440
home environment a lot better think

198
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,479
about e-commerce

199
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,520
our shopping online grew

200
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,159
in the last three months by a growth

201
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,639
that was

202
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
not uh has surpassed the 10 years of

203
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,759
growth and

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,719
it's literally an entire decade of

205
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,840
growth was seen

206
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
over the last three months

207
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,199
everybody started working from home so

208
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,000
there was a rise

209
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,440
in remote working but there was also

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,319
rise in unemployment

211
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,520
think about tools like zoom the zoom

212
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,440
user base

213
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,479
grew from 10 million people to 200

214
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,520
million people

215
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,000
just in the span of two months

216
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,080
slack and teams and all these other

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
global communication tools

218
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,479
and collaboration tools saw some

219
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,318
significant spikes

220
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
look at the learning our kids are going

221
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,399
through

222
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,000
both in school and colleges have mostly

223
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,719
gone to online classes

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,559
travel and mobility has significantly

225
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,240
been disrupted entertainment industry

226
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,679
has been disrupted

227
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,440
health and well-being has taken a

228
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,479
completely new tangent

229
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,480
they've taken a path of e-pharmacy and

230
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,959
e-medicine

231
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
most people would want to go and meet

232
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,319
with a doctor before

233
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,800
or go and pick up their medicine from a

234
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,680
pharmacy and today

235
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,439
most of it is online because you're also

236
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,560
scared of going into a hospital and

237
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,240
contracting

238
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,599
covet so a lot of these industries are

239
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,720
significantly changing

240
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,360
on how our lives have been completely

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,360
disrupted

242
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,839
so what does this mean right it also

243
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
means that there are

244
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,000
bad characters these cyber security

245
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,199
criminals

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,480
that have used this opportunity to

247
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
attack

248
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,320
where we are at our weakest

249
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,599
points the businesses are better

250
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,560
prepared

251
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
but as individuals as human beings who

252
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,719
have now

253
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,720
started to look into an online world

254
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,600
not everybody is as prepared to face

255
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,440
these cyber criminals

256
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,080
since the pandemic and the subsequent

257
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,800
lockdown the number of phishing attacks

258
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,880
have significantly increased

259
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,199
cyber criminals are taking advantage of

260
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,200
this look at this data that came from

261
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,600
trend micro

262
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,320
the single top location for spam and

263
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,279
malware was obviously the united states

264
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,880
and the more wealthy economies there was

265
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,320
a 220

266
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,760
increase in spam from feb to march

267
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,480
of 2020 just in that one month

268
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,079
there was a 260 percent increase in

269
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,800
malicious url

270
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,279
just in the month of march over a

271
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,240
million spam messages related to covet

272
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,560
19 were

273
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:36,240
detected 737

274
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,119
malware were detected related to covet

275
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,440
all of these threats make our lives very

276
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,279
very challenging

277
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
just in the month of march look at the

278
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:50,079
week on weak spike in themes

279
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:53,279
of kobe 19 themed phishing attacks

280
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,479
it went from almost zero to cross

281
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,399
five million uh five million attacks

282
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,320
look at the themed phishing attacks the

283
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,279
spear attacking

284
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,040
the spear phishing attacks crossed a

285
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,120
very very high alarming rates as well

286
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,079
with all these concerns or challenges

287
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,720
that are faced from

288
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,439
the cyber security of cyber cyber cyber

289
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,279
criminal world

290
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,760
we needed to look at what are those

291
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,880
competing priorities in this cohort 19

292
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,959
world and what comes

293
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,200
after this postcode with 19 worlds

294
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,479
the bimodal operations from a business

295
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,040
perspective

296
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,560
needed to be balanced we needed to make

297
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,839
sure our regular working

298
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,760
is continuing but also at the same time

299
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,240
we've got to look at opportunities of

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,760
the future how is the entire world

301
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,320
changing

302
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,720
what is this new business model or what

303
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,480
is this new world throwing to us

304
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,839
and how are we going to face it from a

305
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,600
business perspective

306
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,959
what business models need to be

307
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,959
innovated

308
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,638
and we also need to continue to evolve

309
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,319
or innovate our business

310
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,440
is to continue and leapfrog our

311
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
competition as well

312
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,040
so from a cio's perspective making sure

313
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,160
that the employees and customers and

314
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,279
their data

315
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,279
is safe and secure

316
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,959
we are able to enable our employees to

317
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,360
work from anywhere in a safe environment

318
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,399
technology becomes an extremely

319
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,720
important part of the business world

320
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,240
even for non-technical and technological

321
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,399
businesses

322
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,240
we are privileged that many of us or

323
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,880
most of us are working in the technology

324
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
world

325
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,720
and that we have the ability to work

326
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,279
from anywhere

327
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,560
but not everybody does think about the

328
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,279
street food vendors

329
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,160
to the cleaning staff to the travel

330
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,639
industry

331
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,199
the hospitality industry many of them

332
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,519
wouldn't survive

333
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,519
we also need to come up with new kpis to

334
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,320
align with the new business model

335
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,440
reaping strategies that we need to offer

336
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,800
to accommodate this

337
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,680
with a new security landscape continue

338
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,399
to monitor

339
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,120
our needs and our customers needs and

340
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,680
provide

341
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
the support the services and the

342
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,319
training to be

343
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,319
to be ready for this new world

344
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,920
so most of our cyber security spending

345
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,399
you might see has increased because

346
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,880
given

347
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,959
everything that was happening our so our

348
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,240
budgets from a cio perspective were

349
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,239
already

350
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,040
were already allocated they were already

351
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,399
fixed coming into 2020

352
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,360
but coming into a q2 we are now hit with

353
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,959
one of the world's

354
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,120
worst pandemics and we are going to be

355
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,399
looking at how are we going to manage

356
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,720
those budgets

357
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,639
where we have to increase our spending

358
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,560
on cyber security because it's an

359
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
extremely important part of it we've got

360
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,079
to increase our spending

361
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,519
to make sure we're able to enable our

362
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,519
workforce to work from anywhere

363
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,240
with all these constraints we needed to

364
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,839
look at what are those key focus areas

365
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,839
that we need to spend

366
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,680
so first was to stabilize our core

367
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,000
systems and operations

368
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,079
critical infrastructure making sure the

369
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
systems are available online

370
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,479
and from working available from outside

371
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,399
of the four walls of the offices

372
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,000
making improvements to the processor so

373
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,399
we can continue to

374
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,519
make it simpler and enable our workforce

375
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,440
to work in

376
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,120
an easier and a more efficient manner

377
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,279
inside the offices you're protected

378
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,760
because you have good bandwidth

379
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,399
we can't guarantee that bandwidth when

380
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,399
employees are working from home

381
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,440
even in economies like the us where i'm

382
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,760
based

383
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,680
we had significant bandwidth constraints

384
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,600
because all of a sudden you had

385
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,839
hundreds of millions of people coming

386
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,160
and working from home

387
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,079
students sitting at home and using

388
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,240
netflix and amazon prime and

389
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,199
youtube that increases the bandwidth

390
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,040
requirements at home as well

391
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,240
we are fighting against the kids usage

392
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,719
as a bandwidth for their

393
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,920
entertainment but at the same time we

394
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,120
had to make sure

395
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,560
that our our applications

396
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,800
can work over low bandwidth as well

397
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,319
in economies where there are more

398
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,120
bandwidth constraints

399
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,519
those those challenges become even more

400
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,360
accentuated

401
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,600
with all of these constraints and then

402
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,360
the cyber risk and cyber security issues

403
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,040
that the cyber criminals are having

404
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,040
with us we have more challenges

405
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,600
how do we prioritize the spending if i

406
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,440
looked at my

407
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,320
top five spending four of those suddenly

408
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,480
became cyber security related

409
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,040
and the first is obviously to enable our

410
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,639
employees to work remotely

411
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,639
we wanted to increase the perimeter

412
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,399
security we wanted to increase

413
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,320
the identity and access controls

414
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,639
we increase the security not just for

415
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,240
ourselves but also for our third party

416
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,839
for partners and we need to train our

417
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,000
employees to make sure they're

418
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,839
able to work in a new environment and

419
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,240
the new environment that needed to

420
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,800
make sure that they are thinking more

421
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,839
about safety and security of themselves

422
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,839
and their data

423
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,680
so four of my top five priorities was in

424
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,120
making sure that we have a safe

425
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,120
environment for our customers

426
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,199
we're also constantly looking at what

427
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,560
next

428
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,599
staying focused on our employees and our

429
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,758
customers

430
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,240
thinking about their new needs in this

431
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,959
new world

432
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,160
making sure that we as cios are able to

433
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,399
provide

434
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,319
the technological leadership that our

435
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
businesses require us to promote to

436
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,720
provide

437
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,680
we're looking at understanding the

438
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,240
implications of the new normal

439
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,719
we're looking at cutting costs because

440
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,880
money is now becoming a challenge

441
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,839
our budgets are going to be tightened

442
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,800
because of the

443
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,360
covet impact businesses have suffered

444
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,199
and

445
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,079
we're trying to figure out how to work

446
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,199
with a more constrained budget but at

447
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,839
the same time

448
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,360
we want to stay on the course for the

449
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,119
key priorities that we've already

450
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,280
defined for the year

451
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,559
and the new priorities or the modified

452
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,160
priorities because of the new normal

453
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,959
we see that there is a new normal for

454
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,360
the cyber security providers as well

455
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,160
the product refreshes could be happening

456
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,479
but

457
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,439
could be less it could be at a lower

458
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,120
frequency

459
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,440
delivering services will be more

460
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,559
challenging we have significant new

461
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,000
constraints

462
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,160
where people are not as mobile as before

463
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,400
it needed to be on the cloud remote

464
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,880
online

465
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,280
we are looking at re-platforming our

466
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,440
solutions that we've offered

467
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,720
what was on-prem now needs to be on the

468
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,039
cloud

469
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,840
applications that we were previously

470
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,320
providing

471
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,199
on the on-prem needed to make it needed

472
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,120
to be available

473
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,760
to for our employees to work remotely

474
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,280
but at the same time this is also an

475
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,160
exciting time

476
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,760
for the cyber security industry as cyber

477
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,600
security professionals

478
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,600
i'm sure you're seeing a significant

479
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,199
growth in opportunities and demand for

480
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,600
your skills from this market

481
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,400
what we understand i know there are dark

482
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,320
clouds

483
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,240
but there is a silver lining and that

484
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,320
silver lining is primarily for the cyber

485
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,200
security professionals

486
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,799
both the bad actors as well as the good

487
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,720
ones

488
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,400
we need to make sure that we are able to

489
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,960
provide a safe

490
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,520
and secure environment and make sure we

491
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,160
train

492
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,840
all our employees to be able to work in

493
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,360
a safe and secure

494
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,918
environment i wish you all the best

495
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,799
and with all these challenges i'm sure

496
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,600
that we will

497
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,960
we will all excel and life will continue

498
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,918
and life will excel

499
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,720
and we will continue to be great at this

500
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,880
new world

501
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,880
and we will overcome these challenges

502
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,280
and continue to excel

503
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,360
thank you very much appreciate the time

504
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,600
