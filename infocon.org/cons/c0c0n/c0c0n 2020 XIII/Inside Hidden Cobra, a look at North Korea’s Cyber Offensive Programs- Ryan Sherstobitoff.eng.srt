1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,359
hi welcome to co

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:10,160
con 2020 my name is ryan scherstabidoff

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,840
i am from mcafee advanced threat

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,320
research today we're going to be doing a

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,920
talk

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,640
on hidden cobras cyber offensive

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,640
programs

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,960
so first we'll go into the agenda a

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,400
little bit here a background on hidden

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,920
cobra

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,640
we're going to a brief three-year

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,520
operational cyber review

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
we'll also be looking at um some of the

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,399
behind the scenes

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,600
activity for hitting cobra cyber

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,079
offensive programs

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,000
in addition we'll be talking to some

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,399
about some recent research that we had

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
done

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,640
a while back for operation sharpshooter

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,000
and then we'll do

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
some key takeaways

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,919
so a little bit about hitting cobra

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,519
so you know the us government here has

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,960
classified

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,560
hitting cobra as the overall

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:11,119
classification for north korean cyber

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,760
offensive programs

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
and in the in this case the the industry

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,040
as a whole

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,159
a particular different private sector

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,240
security companies have named

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
activity attributed to hidden cobra in

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,439
in various naming conventions such as

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,560
lazarus bloomer

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,839
norov andario apt37

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,320
in addition when we look at the target

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,880
objectives of these groups we see that

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,199
it differs between each other

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
though they all have distinct and

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,040
separate

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,600
activity we find that the general

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,720
classification here for

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,919
cyber offensive programs here still fall

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,759
under the

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,360
umbrella of hidden cobra

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,439
moving on we'll talk now a little bit

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,439
more about some of the operations some

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,839
of these notable events that we've seen

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,478
over the last couple of years

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,520
in this section here we'll talk about a

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,680
three-year cyber operational review

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,760
and so this is going to go into into a

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,840
little bit more detail about some of the

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,000
stuff that we've seen

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
over the course of a couple of years

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,760
that have been

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,480
either knowingly attributed to hitting

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,440
cobra or has been

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,000
labeled by private sector security

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,000
research

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,959
so from a timeline perspective here we

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,400
have a number of different

64
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,800
cyber operations that have been going on

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,080
for several years obviously this is not

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,080
everything that

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,920
has ever been attributed to hidden cobra

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000
but these are some of the notable ones

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,440
particularly that we

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,800
looked into so ati researched and

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,239
documented

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,239
various targeted intrusions that span

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,400
of the course of 2018 2019

74
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,640
um we also had a review of some of the

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,599
most notable activities that we've seen

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,599
here

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,280
so these are some of the big name events

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,480
that either have made it to

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,480
a publication

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,640
news or or public-facing article that

81
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,518
pertains to some of the activity here

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,440
but

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,319
um so some of the purpose of this talk

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,840
here is to give an overview of um

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
activity but to also show that there's a

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,280
pattern

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,799
of behavior that we've seen and also

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,640
recognize different distinct versions of

89
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,080
malware that we've seen used by this

90
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,599
group over the

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,720
last several years so first

92
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,760
part of the operational review is going

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,359
into depth more

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,239
about operation go secret so go secret

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,280
was a

96
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:04,640
implant um used back

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,200
in 2018 essentially it was derived from

98
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,480
the source code of death over trojan

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,920
dust over

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,119
in trojan dust over is most infamously

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,679
known for an entertainment industry

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,600
attack

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,199
back in 2014 guest over is closely

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,600
tied to another implant known as s-cad

105
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,680
and essentially this is really code

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,840
origins from the early development of

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,479
implants pertaining to hidden cobra from

108
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,000
the early days so we have

109
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,440
back then 2017 2018

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
these are kind of what you could say the

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,080
early years

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:48,240
further on we see that um

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,639
there is a reuse of ssl tls certificates

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,360
that

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,759
have appeared in previous operations

116
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,040
they're using these ssl certificates to

117
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,560
sign

118
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,560
fake tls traffic

119
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,039
and even um more interestingly

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,960
is the reuse of compromised

121
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,639
infrastructure from a

122
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,479
attack that they conducted back in 2014

123
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,680
and it's resurfacing again in this one

124
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,080
now from from an implant perspective

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,960
um it's it's interesting because it was

126
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,320
a

127
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,960
highly complex data recalling implant

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,919
that had a number of capabilities to

129
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,758
gather machine data user configurations

130
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,240
etc

131
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,000
and and send this information back to

132
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,039
the attacker

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520
also go secret utilized a

134
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,479
covert listening network using a

135
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,000
component known as proxy svc

136
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,800
so proxy svc is essentially a component

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
that would forward

138
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,320
traffic to a upper level c2 this was

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,639
found to be used in this attack

140
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,840
we won't go into too much detail about

141
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,440
that

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,359
um in addition we've seen that the

143
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,440
targets have been healthcare

144
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,960
education energy telco government

145
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,919
moving forward we can see here that

146
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,440
there's a clear lineage of implant code

147
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,840
when we start tracking from a

148
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,240
development perspective

149
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,159
we see that from the course of 2014 to

150
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,720
2018 there's a number of different

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,240
implants that originated from

152
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,919
early attacks specifically back in

153
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,120
2014 pertaining to that entertainment

154
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,400
industry attack and

155
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,400
most recently um

156
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,679
in terms of the time frame here that we

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
have

158
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,160
is the hybrid trojan which is using

159
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,359
components from death stover so the

160
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,440
example here is using

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
a code factory-like approach so earlier

162
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,919
components and different pieces are

163
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,880
developed

164
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,159
over the course of many years and used

165
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,039
in different attacks and then

166
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,680
reappearing

167
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,639
in other implants that are used in more

168
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,639
modern times

169
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,639
and so when we try to map this out from

170
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,840
a visual perspective

171
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,440
what this looks like from a linkage

172
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,280
perspective we see that there's a number

173
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,400
of implants here

174
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,599
and each of these implants have a

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
relationship to

176
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,120
each other and more specifically they

177
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,280
have relationships to

178
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,199
earlier trojans which is known as dust

179
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:36,960
over so dust over itself is using

180
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,280
the same compromise c2 infrastructure as

181
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
a 2014 attack

182
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,758
and we're seeing it reappear and go

183
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,239
secret so again yes we're talking about

184
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,919
old

185
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,199
um attacks with the the issue i guess

186
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,599
the um

187
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,440
example here is code reusage so we're

188
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,759
seeing evolution of different codes

189
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,000
they're updating and modifying but

190
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,599
ultimately we see pieces and snippets

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,080
show up in attacks that were conducted

192
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,639
you know

193
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,198
five years ago and they're still showing

194
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,199
up today

195
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440
so moving on we have operation ocean

196
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,479
salt so

197
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,360
operation ocean salt is essentially a

198
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,199
targeted campaign that first appeared

199
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,000
late may

200
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:26,560
2018 targeting korean speaking person

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,440
so this was a different kind of

202
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,919
operation that we also saw

203
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,120
it was using malicious documents here

204
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,598
that were sent to victims containing

205
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,360
subjects that were predominantly

206
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,080
financial

207
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
we also saw that there was a consistent

208
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,519
author of lion

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
again we've seen that metadata contained

210
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,560
information here

211
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,480
that um pertained to

212
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,479
different authors or the same author um

213
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
apologies um that have occurred during

214
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,839
that time frame

215
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,200
we also saw that they were using

216
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,519
code from a apt-1 comment crew

217
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,880
seesaw implant that was observed as

218
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
early

219
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,640
as the beginning of those kind of cyber

220
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
operations again

221
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,920
not attributed to that threat group but

222
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,518
rather

223
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
using code that has appeared in the

224
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,120
underground and just building their own

225
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,839
functionality

226
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
into it

227
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,279
so a little bit more about operation

228
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,959
ocean salt

229
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,519
some of the implants here is it's based

230
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,640
on sea salt code from 2010

231
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,480
and essentially the compilation

232
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,480
of the ocean salt implant wouldn't have

233
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,399
been possible unless they had direct

234
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,720
access to original source code

235
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,600
what we saw here is it's designed as an

236
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,200
implant with

237
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,800
reverse shell capabilities now it wasn't

238
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,720
just that sea salt was re

239
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,599
recompiled in this case here it was the

240
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,560
fact that they were incorporating

241
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,920
both sea salt code and an additional

242
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,160
functionality built

243
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,479
on top of that indicating that the

244
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,040
attacker had access to visual studio

245
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,000
solution files

246
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,040
further the implant first appeared to be

247
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,079
distributed

248
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,199
on june 1st 2018

249
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,279
on a hacked website and then further we

250
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,640
found that multiple debug versions

251
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,079
contain

252
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,959
specific strings that were not found in

253
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,040
the initial ocean salt

254
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,399
that gave us further insight into how

255
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,399
this actually functioned

256
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:48,560
so moving on to the other operation here

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
seeing that operation bank shot which is

258
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,719
a another

259
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,880
u.s government classification

260
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,079
for um the details here so we see

261
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,399
some really interesting stuff here so

262
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,359
it's a turkish banking sector was hit

263
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
with this

264
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,000
malware the us government names it

265
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,200
bankshot which is

266
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,399
also using fake tls protocol which was

267
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
something that

268
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,079
became quite popular and known for

269
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,319
lazarus-based operations

270
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,920
and so that was actually um a fairly

271
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,920
interesting thing that we saw there

272
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,720
um and so what we're doing right now

273
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,680
here is we're going to go into

274
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,399
another operation briefly mention this

275
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,399
there's been a ton of this activity here

276
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,959
fake job recruitment which is another

277
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,040
thing that this group has highly focused

278
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,479
on

279
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,079
and so what they're doing here is that

280
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,279
they're impersonating

281
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,199
threat uh sorry impersonating recruiters

282
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,519
impersonating people

283
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,880
that have legitimate jobs at targets

284
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,560
that they're interested

285
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,360
in um getting access to so for example

286
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,399
they would put a fake job document from

287
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,880
a recruiter that

288
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,079
happened to work at a major defense

289
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,079
contractor

290
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,160
and then they would send this to people

291
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,479
who might be interested

292
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,360
in applying for a position at that

293
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,200
company

294
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,120
and target those but obviously in this

295
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,800
case here it was another defense

296
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,839
contractor that they also focused on

297
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,279
so in this case this was a 2017

298
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,680
operation that we're able to finally

299
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,279
reveal here that is containing

300
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,120
you know very interesting different

301
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
targets that have that have occurred

302
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,200
over a

303
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:39,360
course of several months in 2017 which

304
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
has very similar ttps to something that

305
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
we published about a month ago called

306
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,440
operation north star

307
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,439
we're not going to get into that a lot

308
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,839
here but we're going to talk about

309
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,800
um some of the other operations moving

310
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,200
forward

311
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,120
so very quick um they set up an

312
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,959
elaborate spearfishing campaign to

313
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,040
target employees at major defense

314
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,560
contractors

315
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,560
and they're actually involved in key

316
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,160
defense systems that would be either

317
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,439
used in defense of the korean peninsula

318
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,319
or used directly

319
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,160
on the korean peninsula um some of these

320
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
programs are basically creating decoy

321
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,279
documents with real

322
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,760
legitimate job descriptions taken from

323
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,360
credible sources they're impersonating

324
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,959
individuals that did work at these

325
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,839
organizations

326
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,479
and they're delivering these emails to

327
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,240
contacts within the targets organization

328
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,560
or through other methods

329
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,720
so these attackers here are delivering

330
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,599
maldox that have a link in it that lead

331
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,880
to

332
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,000
additional malicious content um what's

333
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,040
uh

334
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,040
pretty interesting here is that

335
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,199
we're seeing here um that

336
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,040
documents here targeting two defense

337
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,479
contractors using

338
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,240
the same api string obfuscation as a

339
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,760
troy 32 implants used by lazarus group

340
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
so we're seeing that there's actually a

341
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,639
lot of similarities when you start

342
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
breaking this down

343
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,040
further

344
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,760
and classically we'll go into a little

345
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,839
bit more about choi 32 and the

346
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,880
significance of it

347
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,320
so real quick this is a quick

348
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,000
rundown summary of this spear phishing

349
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,000
campaign

350
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,440
they were interested in very specific

351
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,279
technologies

352
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,639
so they were targeting people who worked

353
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,040
on those programs with fake jobs

354
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,120
and this was part of an impersonation

355
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,519
campaign that was

356
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,000
going on for a course of several months

357
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,279
in 2017 we also see it happening

358
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,360
now but we're not going to get into too

359
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,279
much detail on that one

360
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,440
um some of these implants here again

361
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,720
what we've seen here

362
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,920
would gather basic data

363
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,600
you know typical stuff of a

364
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,279
reconnaissance implant to establish

365
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,600
what machine it is who is logged in

366
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,680
the configuration also we'd see that the

367
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,880
command and control would communicate

368
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,519
over fake tls so this is basically

369
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,199
faking a tls packet when in fact it's a

370
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,920
custom protocol

371
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,959
in sending it over port 443 just an

372
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,439
evasion

373
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,199
technique to keep aware of

374
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,920
a couple pictures here are some of the

375
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,359
programs here to put a face to those

376
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,920
that they were targeting during that

377
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
time frame

378
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,279
so um in this case here someone i'm not

379
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,320
going to get into too much detail here

380
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,560
but

381
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,240
some of the operations here was

382
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,638
targeting the sock manager or not the

383
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,720
sock manager but impersonating

384
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,959
someone who worked in infosec at one of

385
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,079
these defense contractors

386
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,959
and sent the spear phishing email to

387
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,239
someone working

388
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,638
on helicopter programs indicating that

389
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,000
they should reset their password

390
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,160
so the mail dock itself was

391
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,519
essentially a password reset guide which

392
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,600
was something legitimate from the

393
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,680
company but they embedded a macro into

394
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,360
it which would then

395
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,359
install an implant

396
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,480
so another example here

397
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,959
of a thaad missile system targeting not

398
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,120
too much detail on that

399
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,199
these are some of the linkedin profiles

400
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,040
that they were creating on behalf of

401
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,800
legitimate people

402
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,319
so they're basically impersonating

403
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,639
recruiters in creating

404
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,720
short-term linkedin accounts to target

405
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,040
these individuals that

406
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,399
are interested they would also follow

407
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,519
those individuals that they're

408
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,360
interested in targeting

409
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,560
here's some more examples for the energy

410
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,199
sector

411
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,199
spoofing real energy sector executives

412
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,239
so that troy 32 implant as we mentioned

413
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,799
previously

414
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,280
is tied to s-cad code so the term toy

415
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,760
has been used consistently through

416
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,359
hitting cobra campaigns especially post

417
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,359
dark soul

418
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,359
and we see that in this case here use a

419
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:19,198
korean language compiler

420
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,000
was hosted at um malicious documents at

421
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,039
these sites

422
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,520
troy 32 implant used that c2

423
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:29,199
and so on it was using the same fake tls

424
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,199
as we've seen in other attacks

425
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,960
so now pause for a second we're now

426
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,399
going to go into looking

427
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,919
at an insider's look at north korean

428
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,919
cyber offensive programs

429
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,840
so to look at some of the impersonation

430
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
techniques

431
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,918
we've seen that they've become quite

432
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,960
skillful and crafted

433
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,080
at impersonating individuals on the

434
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,760
internet

435
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,918
and so we see that there they're

436
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,960
building fake linkedin profiles

437
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:09,120
fake facebook profiles

438
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,280
um they're becoming more

439
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,479
proficient at foreign languages and

440
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,480
targeting

441
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,960
people appearing to um

442
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,799
look authentic to them um given that

443
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,360
they're impersonating credible sources

444
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,440
so that's becoming more sophisticated

445
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,678
even now with the newest operation that

446
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,559
we release operation northstar which is

447
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,039
related you know somewhat to this

448
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,918
activity given the ttps are

449
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,240
similar i'd suggest you go take a look

450
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,000
at the mcafee labs blogs

451
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,559
um there's a publication from about a

452
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,640
month ago that goes into that

453
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,320
so again this is just an example one

454
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,480
thing i do want to note is that they've

455
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,200
used

456
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,880
for a number of years hidden tracking

457
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,280
pixels to

458
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,240
determine the click rate of opening

459
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,200
messages

460
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,200
being sent from them

461
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,160
some more examples here of the different

462
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,480
emails the different

463
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,480
profiles that they've been impersonating

464
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,918
here

465
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,320
some more examples here of energy

466
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,320
executives as we covered previously

467
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,559
and finally there's more here that go

468
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,120
into

469
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,080
some of the details they were using

470
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,320
email tracking

471
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,960
links from gmass to be able to determine

472
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,439
how many people actually open the email

473
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,440
and where

474
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,959
so now we're going to kind of shift

475
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,799
topics here

476
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,799
get into a research where we were able

477
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,760
to get access to a command and control

478
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,360
server

479
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,360
and analyze some of the back end

480
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,240
so real quick sharpshooter was a

481
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,120
targeted campaign

482
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,799
that was also using um different

483
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,239
implants they were

484
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:01,760
um targeting different you know energy

485
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,840
nuclear um high technology

486
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,520
through coordination with different

487
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,439
international law enforcement were able

488
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,679
to obtain a copy

489
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,960
of back-end code which gave us further

490
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,120
insight

491
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,880
in terms of how of this activity

492
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
actually related to not only hidden

493
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,240
cobra

494
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,280
but how they operated in addition we

495
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,080
could effectively

496
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,080
map it back to activity in 2017.

497
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,080
so in this case here we see that there's

498
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,080
a web shell installed this was a you

499
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,240
know classic chinese webshell here that

500
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
they're used to

501
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,200
maintaining persistence we saw that the

502
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,158
actor also connected via expressvpn

503
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,159
to hide themselves

504
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,120
so i also see that we can track and find

505
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,559
additional infrastructure based on

506
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,280
shared tls

507
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,960
certificates so these shared tls

508
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,399
certificates allow us to be able to

509
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,960
track other c2s and ip addresses

510
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,840
that are also using this for

511
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
authentication

512
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,320
and so now when we start looking at the

513
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,120
threat activity timeline

514
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,559
for rising sun which was the implant you

515
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,399
can go read about

516
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,678
operation sharpshooter on the mcafee

517
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,039
labs blog

518
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,520
but this kind of again shows to my point

519
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,360
about

520
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,760
tracking operations over the years

521
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,840
in the sharing of code in the similarity

522
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,840
of ttps

523
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,919
and this mel tango chart here is another

524
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,840
perfect example

525
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,760
of linkage of

526
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,959
operations from sharpshooter to other

527
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,280
ones based on different code sharing tls

528
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,200
infrastructure and as you can see it

529
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,360
goes into numerous different directions

530
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,559
here that show that there's

531
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,840
relationships

532
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,840
even at the minute

533
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,840
and smallest detail

534
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,399
so quick analysis of what the backend

535
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,200
components did here

536
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
we see that the backhand are using

537
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,240
several different things they're all

538
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,360
written in python code

539
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,240
some of the other ones were actually

540
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,840
found to be written in asp language

541
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,159
we found that the back end use a

542
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,158
multi-layered approach to relay commands

543
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,320
to a master server

544
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,720
so what's interesting about that is that

545
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,559
it's sending and relaying commands

546
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,559
up the channel to a hidden c2

547
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,280
so that means that it makes it more

548
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,879
difficult to discover the actual

549
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,200
infrastructure if the commands are being

550
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,280
relayed

551
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,360
we found that this was custom coding

552
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,039
this was something that was

553
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,918
not taken off the shelf or on the

554
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,760
underground this little picture here

555
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,480
shows kind of a general flow of how all

556
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,480
this works

557
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,479
moving on and so just you know when you

558
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,439
get a chance to actually

559
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,360
analyze a back-end c2 server

560
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,960
it reveals a number of interesting

561
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,959
things so when we

562
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,360
dissected it we saw that there's a

563
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,520
number of different things that

564
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,918
showed how it would process the results

565
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,360
coming from the implant

566
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,520
so these are the different you know

567
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,039
parameters that were available

568
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,879
free query suggestion result set so

569
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,879
these were all set to do their own

570
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,000
different functionality as you can see

571
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,480
here

572
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,320
and essentially the main menu php as we

573
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,240
saw in the previous slide here was a

574
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,639
command handler

575
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,600
so as you can see down here um there's a

576
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,280
main

577
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,678
menu page view is the main command

578
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,480
handler which would handle commands

579
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,039
coming in

580
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:50,640
from the rising sun implant in the

581
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:52,879
following format in this box down here

582
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,400
it has always when we get a hold of

583
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,679
these commanding control code there's a

584
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,120
number of different other

585
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,279
esp pages php pages that indicate

586
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,678
you know supporting functionality like

587
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,039
deleting files managing files managing

588
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,600
logs

589
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,400
um this is something that additional

590
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,399
functionality

591
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:20,000
so further a little bit

592
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,360
more details in mypng.png

593
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,880
designed to target middle east aerospace

594
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,959
companies

595
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
the first stage is basically an implant

596
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,600
to collect basic data and install

597
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
further implants

598
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,879
framework.php is a downloader

599
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,240
essentially that's used to retrieve an

600
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,159
encrypted

601
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,080
packed version and inject it into memory

602
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,279
so this little implant here the first

603
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,480
stage one gets the

604
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,640
user agent collects basic data and then

605
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,320
once all that is done it decodes into

606
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,720
memory the second stage which is the

607
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,399
main

608
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,000
rising sun v2 in this case

609
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,919
and so typically this is kind of a

610
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,240
process that we see a lot of it

611
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,279
with these operations first stage basic

612
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,000
implant

613
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,600
second stage is then loaded directly

614
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,559
into memory and this is how that

615
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,559
operation works

616
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,919
so this is just some additional things

617
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,240
here showing how we're able to track

618
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,360
other c2s that have this other kind of

619
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,799
traffic

620
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,399
based on an analysis of pcaps

621
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,639
of samples so we can see that there's

622
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,240
many similarities here for

623
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,679
other ones that are out there in the

624
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,120
wild allowing us to track

625
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,120
backtrack and see other stuff

626
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,960
and so this is again just some other

627
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,200
components supporting ones

628
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,240
vendor php was one to serve the apple

629
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:47,440
png to the downloader which is the

630
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,440
encrypted rising sun v2 apple png

631
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,679
so last but not least on on the rising

632
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,760
sun we see all the capabilities here

633
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,400
of all the configuration communication

634
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,480
and deployment techniques

635
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,919
um a lot to get into but this is the

636
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,440
general

637
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,840
methodology here of the different

638
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,440
capabilities

639
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,959
and differences between the different

640
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,840
versions that we've tracked over the

641
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,840
years

642
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,399
and then we also found that there's log

643
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,400
files indicating that the actor found

644
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,000
that nambibian

645
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,279
ip addresses were used to test the

646
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,279
rising site implant

647
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,840
and this was the last activity that we

648
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,918
saw late 2019

649
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,520
that was starting an israeli defense

650
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,200
company again

651
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,279
classical rising sun but this time it

652
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,720
was being delivered via

653
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,720
wind rar ace vulnerability

654
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,440
and masquerading as assistant product

655
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,440
documentation

656
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,720
so what have we learned here today

657
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,720
in cobra is a resourceful group with

658
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,640
numerous different implants so what we

659
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,159
see here is that

660
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,520
there's many things that have changed

661
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,200
over the years that are getting better

662
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,879
and better

663
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,720
yes we see that more intentional

664
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,679
obfuscation of code

665
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,559
um to mask any identifying similarities

666
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,720
making very

667
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:19,120
hard to reverse engineer samples

668
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,880
which is making the the analysis job

669
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,639
partner

670
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,799
second usage of false flags um to

671
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,559
make it seem like different ept groups

672
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,200
are also

673
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,200
responsible

674
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,240
and also we see that this consistent of

675
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,799
code sharing patterns we've seen that

676
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,880
a code factory cycle has been appearing

677
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,240
here throughout the campaigns

678
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,240
it's definitely clear that we've seen

679
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,760
throughout the years that development

680
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,039
of implants and operators of are the

681
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,039
same we see that there's different

682
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,720
groups responsible for conducting the

683
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,799
attack and different groups responsible

684
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,960
for development

685
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,200
and so as we see here we've seen a shift

686
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,000
