of what we say in the midst of uh

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,679
of corona uh we have you know 30 million

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
people already tested sadly close to 1

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,360
million

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,559
people are dead but what started as a

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,440
crisis as a health

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,199
crisis is now an economic crisis and it

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,239
is clear

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,040
we see a lot of us going rapidly to the

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,480
digital

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,280
we're working from home or from wherever

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,718
but not from

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,199
office we're working remotely well

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
we are all actually keeping the hackers

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,920
busy

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
and overloaded with work if you're a

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
hacker you're waking up this morning and

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,079
saying oh my god this is like a candy

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,000
store what do i take first to taste

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:09,840
so vigorously actively we fill them

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,880
around the world 78 of cyber attacks

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,600
over the last

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,439
few months where of course related to

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,039
corona we're talking about

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,320
a staggering number of 200 000 weekly

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,799
and that would include also websites or

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,479
emails related with the word corona or

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,079
covid in their domain

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,280
40 40 000 new domains

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,919
have recently been opened but you know

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
10

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,479

and uh i'm sure like like me all of us

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,799
were busy

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
in various kind of activities related to

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,160
cyber security i

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,599
found that in india especially there

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,480
were 300

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,200
increase in cyber attacks and cyber

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,599
crimes

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,879
so i got lots of investigation work i

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,040
got lots of

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,000
root cause analysis work in such a

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,720
pandemic

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,280
and then it was actually surprised for

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,879
me to

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,480
understand like these hackers and

69
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,799
criminals they are creating very

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,440
sophisticated attack vectors

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,200
especially uh during lockdown and not

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,879
only with social engineering but they

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,958
how could they actually penetrate to

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,239
those systems those are considered to be

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,280
highly secure

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,280
so that was a big for me as well and

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
it was a great learning for sure i mean

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,160
please share a bit

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,319
a little bit more about yourself i mean

80
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,040
you're renowned in india but we want to

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,920
you know know you a little bit better

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,679
sure then so

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,760
uh i work closely with all law

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,200
enforcement agencies in india

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,599
like nia cbi and npa and dpr indian

86
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,480
net grade etc and also state police

87
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,560
department

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,399
so if there is any such critical cyber

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,319
crime which requires an expertise from

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,239
an ethical hacker's perspective or a

91
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,238
security expert perspective i get

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,200
involved and i help them to solve those

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,200
cases

94
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,560
this is one of my expertise i also work

95
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,480
with tech mahindra

96
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,560
i'm hiding their red teaming operation

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,480

98
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,680

uh technology greatest cool so

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,680
just to give you a bit about myself

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
today marks actually 12 years

106
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,599
since my last coupon talk so i was there

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,720
in the initial stages of cooking when

108
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,798
they started off

109
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,799
and it's really good to be back in

110
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,439
cocoon

111
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,360
so about myself i basically had cyber

112
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,400
security for aia

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,239
my primary forte would be on

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,319
cyber defense threat intelligence

115
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,640
forensics and that's what i've pretty

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,000
much been doing for the last 13 years

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,679
i've been working with multiple

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,360
government agencies from

119
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
all the way from the caribbean to the

120
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,320
pacific to africa

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,120
where i spent at least four or five

122
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,759
years in trying to build national assets

123
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
establishing national forensics lab and

124
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,560
at the same time trying to build a

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,080
national framework

126
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,960
for cyber security so over the

127
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,960
last four months it's something which

128
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,320
everybody can recollect it's been held

129
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,400
frozen over um and to give you how we

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,000
have been impacted by kobe it is

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,239
my headquarters is based out of hong

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,360
kong and my one half of my cyber

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,240
security operations

134
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,280
is based out of china so beware the

135
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,919
first hit

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,440
when corona actually came out so from

137
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,198
ground reality to

138
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,360
getting it back to operations and

139
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,320
running it again it's been a real

140
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
challenge

141
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,919
i'm sure i'm sure thank you for this jay

142
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,759
yeah

143
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,880
hi i think i was caught with the corona

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,479
in a more interesting place

145
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,400
i was in a ski vacation then we

146
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,360
receive the message when you come home

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,080
don't go to work go home for two weeks

148
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,919
guarantee

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,840
warranty and start operating from home

150
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,960
so we didn't have a time to to organize

151
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,599
a little bit about myself i served in

152
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,960
the army as a helicopter pilot

153
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,160
later on went into computers uh

154
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,880
business starting as a programmer

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,880
rnd manager on the software house

156
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,759
managing a software house

157
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:51,360

to be the cio ceo and cyber security

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,680

165
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,479
corona if you want i can tell you a

matter if you have a job you need to

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
have a startup it's like

173
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,719
like you need to have a car you need to

174
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,800
have a startup and it doesn't matter

175
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
so guys you all see we have you know

176
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
high foreheads

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,319
and not a lot of hair some of it is

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,000
because the hard work

179
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,160
we had to put throughout corona

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,759
some of us had to take care of let's say

181
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,520
hundreds of workers

182
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,680
overnight needing to work from home vpn

183
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,680
was not created to hold a hundred

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,080
percent of our workers from home

185
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
maybe 10 maybe 20 everything is

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,960
congested

187
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,280
we know again that we have a lot of

188
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,919
unmonitored

189
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,080
uh internet systems we are not sure

190
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,120
about the security patches

191
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,840
i mean it's a nightmare to all of us so

192
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,120
i would like our steam panel panelists

193
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,758
now to really

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,479
share with us what kind of new threat

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,280
vectors

196
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,199
have you noticed during this pandemic

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,599
amit go ahead

198
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,639
yeah it was really uh interesting to

199
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,240
understand

200
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,080
these new threat vectors because

201
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,919
traditionally the kind of

202
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,440
attack that we have observed we're

203
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,318
actually exploiting some availabilities

204
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,880
of the system

205
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,160
whether it is uh like either sql

206
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,440
injection or

207
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,840
or xor or any such uh standard iodo or

208
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,080
vulnerability that were exploited

209
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,679
exploited but in this time i have

210
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,198
especially observed like even if an

211
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,680
organization is highly secure and

212
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,280
sophisticated uh these hackers were able

213
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,360
to penetrate them because

214
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,960
of their third party or four party

215
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,440
vendors

216
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,198
so that was really a new thing for me

217
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
because earlier we used to think

218
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,800
that we just need to focus our risk to

219
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,560
our own parametrics

220
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
but now the risk is there because of our

221
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,400
third party and four-party vendors

222
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,159
that we have missed out and we have

223
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,679
never thought of it seriously

224
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
especially for a bank when i was doing

225
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,879
an investigation in u.s i found

226
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,759
like a email availability was exploited

227
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,000
initially

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,120
of their law firm from where they are

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
they were taking services

230
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,960
so basically the vulnerability were

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,479
there in in the law firm not in the bank

232
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,319
but then the data from the bank was

233
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,838
stolen so that is something which we i

234
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,800
have observed first time and i think it

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,959
is interesting to

236
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,478
prepare ourselves in future considering

237
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,518
these kind of new techniques

238
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,519
clear okay

239
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,640
okay so in my case what i would say is

240
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,319
uh from a vector perspective what we saw

241
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,959
was a rice and

242
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,160
uh phishing or spam emails malicious

243
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,800
attachments

244
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,839
uh there were coming disguised in covet

245
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,479
teams

246
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,040
somewhere around jan the flood started

247
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,440
and

248
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,800
around till march june they were still

249
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,959
going in full fledge

250
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,240
and during that time one of the usual

251
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,079
things is that

252
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,920
we didn't see the normal kind of

253
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,720
adversaries that you would be expecting

254
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,479
from a financial industry acting up but

255
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,640
rather it was more or less like

256
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,320
new infrastructures new players in the

257
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,839
market often people

258
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,920
trying their luck disguising as a

259
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,839
let's say one of your employees has

260
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,560
gotten a uh go with positive

261
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,160
we need you to fill in these details etc

262
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,399
so that was one of the waves that we saw

263
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,240
and towards june we saw a shift in

264
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,200
patterns where we saw a lot more

265
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,040
nation state actors coming into play and

266
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,440
one of the interesting things that

267
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,240
we did observe or what i personally saw

268
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,399
is that

269
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,040
given that people are now distributed

270
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,600
patching of machines becomes challenging

271
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,959
so pretty much all the microsoft uc

272
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,640
critical vulnerabilities

273
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,719
are now being pushed on all over clear

274
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,160
of course we would like you guys later

275
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,560
to share some tips

276
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,519
you know what did you really do if it's

277
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,000
okay to share

278
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:11,839
yeah you mentioned business continuity

279
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,279
and cio of a bank how is life

280
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,279
during corona for a bank

281
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,640
it's a challenging let's say you know

282
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,440
the the basic culture of a bank is

283
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,040
everything inside nothing outside

284
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,519
everything on premise

285
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:34,000
nothing on the cloud and suddenly

286
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
you have to move from working inside

287
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,440
your territory

288
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,560
outside from home it seems you know if i

289
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,839
talk to someone a month before

290
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,239
everyone will tell you you're crazy it's

291
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,760
impossible

292
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,120
but amazingly people can adjust

293
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,399
and in two weeks we moved from working

294
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,600
on premise

295
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,640
working from home

296
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,240
we had a small group

297
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,240
that was working at the beginning you

298
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,880
know technicians and their

299
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,839
vice president et cetera suddenly you

300
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,959
have to buy

301
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,160
hundreds of left laptops arrange

302
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,079
everything

303
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,319
and spread them around the israel and

304
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,640
everyone was doing that you know all the

305
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,440
banks all the companies all the firms

306
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,519
everyone

307
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,040
needed the laptop so there were no

308
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,839
laptops left

309
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,719
and we needed to be to to continue

310
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,800
working

311
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,920
so we moved into uh

312
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,040
private computers private computers that

313
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,959
were working

314
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:44,240
on the same computer on zoom for school

315
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,199
or for a plan you know the kids were

316
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,920
home

317
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,279
everything was a mess we have to arrange

318
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,160
very quickly

319
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,160
you know to to to take care of these

320
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,360
home computers

321
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,120
at the beginning we were spreading uh

322
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,519
vpns and direct lines

323
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,880
but it wasn't enough because everyone

324
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,000
was using that

325
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,800
so we have to move into wi-fi and to

326
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,320
spread into

327
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,880
a more security

328
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,639
preventive measurement and then we did

329
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,760
we didn't have enough of that

330
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,079
so we have to buy from few vendors and

331
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,760
to

332
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,800
have more special specialities so

333
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,680
you know it was like a war

334
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,719
exactly well let me tell you let me tell

335
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,399
you the war

336
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,760
is ongoing yeah and sadly it ain't

337
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,120
changing

338
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,279
it will continue and it will be fierce

339
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,480
so what you're saying is that if i'm a

340
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,320
customer of the bank

341
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,399
and i'm used to come to the bank and

342
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,920
sign documents and all this all of a

343
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,240
sudden i can come

344
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,599
but you need my signature so you go

345
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,519
digital

346
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,800
so how do you prepare for all of this i

347
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,839
mean it sounds like a huge

348
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,920
infrastructure

349
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:03,200
that needs to be in place overnight

350
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,719
yeah you know in the banking

351
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,760
business everything is very slow slowly

352
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,959
slow here

353
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,079
so you are starting new ideas

354
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,119
and checking them validating them on

355
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,680
your own pace

356
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,760
everything should be more secure so

357
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:25,599
everything but that was on the labs

358
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:29,279
we everything was very rapid so we did

359
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,320
have something initiatives but it wasn't

360
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,200
on air

361
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,200
so everything was very rapidly growing

362
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,720
and we did everything

363
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,120
as a matter of fact you can see it's

364
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,959
possible okay

365
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,399
by the way i just want to say jay i will

366
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,239
ask you in a second because you

367
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,000
your company is the one of the biggest

368
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,000
in the world for life insurance and you

369
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,240
have tons of documents to sign

370
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,680
yeah but just to say that to the

371
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,519
startups i work with

372
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,800
and probably there are a lot of startups

373
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,079
in the audience

374
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,800
well we knew that if i would to reach

375
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,359
out

376
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,680
to yair as the cio of the bank and tell

377
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,839
him listen i have this new technology

378
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,839
i want you to try it you know do a poc

379
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,560
he will say

380
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
slowly slowly i'm a bank but what we

381
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,518
found that

382
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,600
during corona all of a sudden the cio is

383
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,040
very receptive to the problem that he

384
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,160
has and he's willing to take

385
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,079
any startup on board and overnight get

386
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,600
decisions to implement you so what i'm

387
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,000
saying sometimes

388
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,880
this corona also offers a lot of

389
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,920
opportunity

390
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,560
it and it also showed everyone from both

391
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,959
sides

392
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,319
that when something is needed there are

393
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,119
no hurdles

394
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,680
there are no problems you just engage if

395
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,680
it's

396
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,439
100 baked jay can you please

397
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,959
relate to the same problems that the

398
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,959
bank had to endure with the

399
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,959
documentation and signature and all that

400
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,160
so within the

401
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,399
company of within our company itself

402
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,880
it's fine because we actually did move

403
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,079
into

404
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,680
uh digital signatures quite early on

405
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,760
but in terms of working with the

406
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,760
customers and collaterals like

407
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,680
what your heels have said it is a

408
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,760
challenge for us as well

409
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,040
because when it comes to these kind of

410
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,600
things at the end of the day

411
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,279
you need to get that written signature

412
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,959
no matter how much digital you are

413
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,000
trying to evolve into

414
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,800
so that are still there

415
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,839
yeah let me sharpen my question so if

416
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,680
you see let's say a

417
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:33,519
problem to deal with the digital signing

418
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,638
when you try to overcome it

419
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,600
do you create a solution that fits all

420
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,079
or you need to have several solutions to

421
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,199
deal with the threats

422
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,040
so it would be different because about

423
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,880
how we are structured we operate out of

424
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,160
19 different countries so

425
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,320
19 of them would have different

426
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,079
regulatory requirements based on which

427
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,720
we can't have a single cut solution

428
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,560
for all now most of the ones which can

429
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,160
be commonly grouped in together

430
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,920
they would eventually move into one

431
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,680
solution and the others would be

432
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,759
different ones

433
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,160
right so it's not a one size fits all

434
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,600
solution that we can go ahead with

435
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,399
clear um amit they need i mean

436
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,680
you as an expert these guys have to deal

437
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,480
also a lot with privacy

438
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,638
that's a huge issue gdpr is all over

439
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,880
everyone now

440
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,279
what do you see how do they how do you

441
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,839
how do organizations that you work with

442
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,839
deal with it

443
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,079
so privacy is has always been the reason

444
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,560
of providing the security because we

445
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,638
want to keep our data private and secure

446
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,079
and especially with these new kind of

447
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,639
ransomware attacks

448
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,000
those are actually not only encrypting

449
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,519
the data locally but they are also

450
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
stealing this data out and making it

451
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,000
public eventually to the dark wave

452
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,519
i think privacy has become a big concern

453
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
if i can give you an example of this

454
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,480
recent

455
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,240
cognition project where they lost almost

456
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,680
100 million dollars because of a

457
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,759
renaissance base their biggest concern

458
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,720
was not that the data is encrypted but

459
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,079
the data was leaked outside and the the

460
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,600
guy was threatening them like

461
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,000
if you don't pay me this ransom we'll

462
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,000
make it public and this data is actually

463
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,520
very sensitive not only from banking

464
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,559
perspective because they have customers

465
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,240
all around the world

466
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,240
and they are offering security to other

467
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,000
customers so a company which is offering

468
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,000
security services to other customers

469
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,520
if they get hacked it becomes a much

470
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,679
more bigger problem for them

471
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,599
so i think uh from data privacy

472
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,559
perspective worldwide if i can focus on

473
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,600
indian perspective

474
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:34,160
india right now is still struggling to

475
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,678
have a full-fledged data privacy law

476
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,520
and we don't have that law although

477
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,760
there are there are standards

478
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,799
all around the world gdpr and then us

479
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,960
data privacy

480
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,559
acts and builds but in india we are here

481
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,640
to have that and that's why

482
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,480
most of these companies are literally

483
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,480
taking the leverage of it and

484
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,919
are relaxed and that even the data is

485
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,919
out because of any reason

486
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,840
they are not penalized but we are

487
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,960
expecting this bill to come too soon to

488
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,280
the parliament and probably

489
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
then we'll be having that sort of

490
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,879
regulations

491
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,919
and the law and order uh boundaries for

492
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,240
those companies

493
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,160
but if i take this example because i

494
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,080
started with this cognition attack

495
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,440
why this attack was successful and how

496
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,760
could it happen

497
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,480
i'll just tell you a story line like

498
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,440
last year

499
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,799
in july this mage ransomware was made

500
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,120
public on 27th

501
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,559
july around and there were sequence of

502
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,479
uh informations

503
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,000
released warnings advisories by

504
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,160
different companies including wireless

505
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,600
total and then fbi and then many other

506
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,120
organizations all around the world

507
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,360
and there were sequence of attacks like

508
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,120
on 8th of june the major ransomware

509
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,199
attacked a threat intelligence

510
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,879
organization then they attacked country

511
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,160
agencies then they attacked

512
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,559
a missile corporation in u.s then fbi

513
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,960
won something on 2nd of jan

514
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,039
and then they attacked md labs what i'm

515
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,160
trying to say like despite of having so

516
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,799
many warnings and

517
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,720
attacks all these organizations or

518
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,039
organizations are not considering

519
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,880
this as an input system with that input

520
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,720
when we did the root cause analysis of

521
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,720
cognition we found that they have

522
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,840
actually not implemented all those iocs

523
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
and hash values

524
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,240
because during this all sequence of

525
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,880
attacks same hash values were used

526
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,799
of that ransomware and the source of

527
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,720
attack was also more or less same

528
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,480
so if they could have considered that as

529
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,360
an input timely i think they could have

530
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,760
protected

531
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,439
so these kind of ignorance is actually

532
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,080
becoming a big concern for larger

533
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,280
magicians

534
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,840
where it was not a zero day sort of a

535
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,080
thing it

536
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,159
has been there we had enough information

537
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,159
to protect us against them

538
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,240
okay yeah yeah

539
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,000
before before you answer what you want i

540
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,960
just want to add something to your

541
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,559
answer

542
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,960
um the bank seeing the problem

543
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,559
uh you're facing with the corona did

544
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,760
they really allocate

545
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,320
more resources was more money invested

546
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,039
into getting yourself you know better uh

547
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,360
uh

548
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,280
secured against this those threats

549
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,840
coming now

550
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,399
of course now their budgets are moving

551
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,320
into

552
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,760
cyber security we have new vectors of

553
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,480
attacks right now if before

554
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,879
everything was uh you you took care of

555
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,480
your

556
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,360
employees working on premise it was more

557
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,360
easy

558
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:25,840
now it's a zero trust environment

559
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,840
because you don't know if your employees

560
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,479
logging into your systems you can log in

561
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,679
from home or from a cafe

562
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,360
or from the way and you don't and

563
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,760
right now the weak spot is

564
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,719
something we call a man in the middle

565
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,280
because

566
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,480
someone can come in the middle between

567
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,918
the employee

568
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,280
or the client and the systems

569
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,159
while in the middle nobody feels it

570
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,360
because

571
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,240
the system thinks it's the client or the

572
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,799
employee

573
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,280
and the employee thinks is on the bank

574
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,000
and

575
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,720
in the middle the hacker takes

576
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,559
everything

577
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:12,240
he can put materials on your computer

578
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,879
a ransomware and then suddenly

579
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,000
all of the employees can't work like it

580
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,360
happened in tower semiconductors

581
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,960
a a supplier was in a

582
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,479
logging into the systems we put in

583
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,600
and only a ransomware say a

584
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,799
tower semiconductors were shut down for

585
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,360
a few days

586
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,320
every day not working millions and

587
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,799
millions

588
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,960
eventually they paid they paid few

589
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,520
hundred thousand dollars

590
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,559
for their ransomware and now we have two

591
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,840
threats

592
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:51,120
one and not to work and one

593
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,399
data leaking the the the hacker

594
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,959
they say look we publish

595
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
inside information if you want us to

596
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,520
stop

597
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,360
uh pay us and then we will release the

598
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,799
ransomware elsewhere trying to do

599
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,000
to damage the backups first

600
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,200
they damage the backups few

601
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,320
days weeks later when they put on your

602
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,880
their ransomware you don't have backups

603
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,760
so you don't have any choice unless to

604
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,799
pay

605
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,158
and if we are dealing corona i believe

606
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,760
it will continue

607
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:33,679
like living with corona living with

608
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,720
cyber and understanding sometimes

609
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,280
you have to pay in order to continue

610
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,400
to pay for your faults to pay for your

611
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,678
mistake

612
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,280
and continue thank you uh well i know

613
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,440
from personal knowledge that

614
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,720
your startup irish shield deals with

615
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,880
many in the middle

616
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,919
and uh i'm happy to say that i know the

617
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,039
solution to be

618
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,679
very good uh jay so

619
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,320
we all agree that hackers are brilliant

620
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,280
people

621
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,678
i mean they are smarter like above way

622
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,720
above

623
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,559
average technologically and

624
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,440
psychologically but i know that when

625
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,240
corona and it seems to be still here to

626
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,919
stay

627
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,799
also creates a situation for our workers

628
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,240
when all of a sudden job security is

629
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,120
very hard to find

630
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,400
there's a lot of uncertainty and

631
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,199
sometimes

632
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,120
workers also get this idea that they

633
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,480
need to do something about it

634
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,840
and maybe be a little bit harmful to the

635
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,360
organization also

636
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,039
what do you know to tell us about it did

637
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,639
you encounter any such as

638
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:43,520
incidents so touchwood we haven't

639
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,559
so insider threat definitely has gone up

640
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,799
the risk scale

641
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,600
in terms of a cio's wrist mapping

642
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,279
one of the primary reasons being a

643
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,959
people have a false sense of job

644
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,039
security some they feel that

645
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,400
they might be losing their job tomorrow

646
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,039
uh p

647
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
is this is a time when people can take

648
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,559
the

649
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,080
actual home desktops or laptops back to

650
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,760
their own personal homes

651
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,279
rather than having working it out of the

652
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,000
office and

653
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,120
see is this is also the time where

654
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,840
people are finding

655
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,559
new venues where they can actually start

656
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,678
trading

657
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,158
or sharing information a classic example

658
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,400
which

659
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,640
i've seen in this region would be where

660
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,000
people started selling insider trading

661
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,960
details out

662
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,480
just for that extra cash of money to

663
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,840
survive this time

664
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,600
because different people are treating

665
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,360
the pandemic in different ways some of

666
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,399
them have slash salaries

667
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,479
some of them have given a forceful work

668
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,159
work without pay some of them have been

669
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
asked to stay back home come back after

670
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,679
a month

671
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,400
etc so those are the scenarios where we

672
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,080
often

673
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,440
tend to see these kind of activities

674
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,399
happening

675
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,080
i see guys uh would you please press

676
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
also the uh

677
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,520
the chatting because we are getting some

678
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,799
some questions from

679
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,000
our audience which seems seems to be

680
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,559
very involved

681
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,240
so please uh run run through them i

682
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,240
think we have touched uh

683
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,440
most of the questions but if you if your

684
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,880
eyes see something that you want to

685
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,440
speak about go ahead

686
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,000
uh amit i know you you have for sure

687
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,679
something to

688
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,720
say yes so i would just like to give you

689
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,520
suggestions

690
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,799
to the organization uh because uh the

691
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,120
thing which we have missed out the

692
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,480
recent uh sophisticated that i like

693
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,559
vectors in the malware that i have

694
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
noticed are something like this agent

695
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,879
tesla

696
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,640
is actually creating lots of issues for

697
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,240
us as your relative is creating lots of

698
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,720
issues njrat is there

699
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,400
then we have uh something like uh

700
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,120
thinkbot and emote so these are

701
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,080
few four five kind of malwares we need

702
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,520
to protect

703
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,600
continuously against that because they

704
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,879
are changing their signatures they are

705
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,199
changing their hash values

706
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,799
and they are continuously on rise and

707
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
then especially for india if i can

708
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,240
suggest apt41

709
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,679
is actually becoming quite aggressive

710
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,840
since last week

711
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,279
and it is leading when we are

712
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,320
attributing these attacks and this is a

713
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,799
chinese

714
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,520
apt and they are actually disturbing a

715
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,559
lot to

716
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,720
indian banks and organizations

717
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,158
that we have observed and noticed so i

718
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,480
think we need to be

719
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,720
safeguarded against that and then there

720
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,960
are traditional

721
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,480
abilities those are exploited because of

722
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,039
the work from home situation

723
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,600
we were not prepared and there were no

724
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,720
secure

725
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,158
vpn available especially when these call

726
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,360
centers were running because we never

727
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,960
thought that call center will

728
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,879
eventually be running from workforce

729
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,480
situation and these call center guys

730
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,279
actually they have access of this

731
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,159
ei data so all these banks and the

732
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,960
companies are

733
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,159
offering the call center services they

734
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,000
need to take care of

735
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,520
a lot because this data is now getting

736
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,240
leaked i have uh

737
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,840
i think day for yesterday i found a

738
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,880
couple of companies on dog if they are

739
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,199
selling

740
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,919
complete pi database of lots of indian

741
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,159
augmentation

742
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,679
it includes your payment details

743
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,120
transaction details your location

744
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,360
history and everything they're selling

745
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,600
it

746
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,520
and that's when so i think this has been

747
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,918
happening and we need to safeguard us

748
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,000
amit i think thank you for this i think

749
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,400
uh our audience really would like to

750
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,880
hear from you guys as experts i mean

751
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,279
ransom is all around us i mean people

752
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,640
are attacked left and right do you pay

753
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:19,760
you don't pay what to do they take your

754
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,600
people are lost for answers about it

755
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,679
please please share with us

756
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,199
some something practical from your

757
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,480
experience from your knowledge

758
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,840
what do we do with this see first of all

759
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,880
yeah sorry i think uh yeah

760
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,760
you know it's like dealing with the

761
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,919
virals or with the kidnap

762
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,240
first you don't deal with the criminals

763
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,000
you say i don't pay but first you have

764
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,159
to prepare

765
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,120
to do anything possible not to be

766
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,320
kidnapped or

767
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,199
take a vaccine not to take the virus but

768
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,720
after you got it it's very easy to say

769
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,200
not to pay

770
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,080
but if it's your father lying on the

771
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,679
hospital

772
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,199
and you need to pay for a breathing

773
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,640
machine because he didn't took the

774
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,720
vaccine

775
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,200
you will pay for the breathing machine

776
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,720
in order to take a team alive

777
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,440
so if you can not pay of course it's

778
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,720
better

779
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,159
but if you have the ransomware and right

780
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,960
now it's a decision

781
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,880
either to close your company and go home

782
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,240
or to pay

783
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,840
you you should consider to pay

784
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
and that's it you know yeah we have to

785
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,439
admit we are in a business

786
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,799
and it's and it's it's a risk and

787
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,919
what i wanted to say is a vector of uh

788
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,279
infection

789
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,480
from a ransomware you have to

790
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:47,360
to consider is your suppliers

791
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,520
most cases you you take care of your

792
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,719
customers and their employees

793
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,399
but the weakest chain

794
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,039
in the weakest link is the suppliers

795
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,959
you have to check them very carefully

796
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,440
more than you check your employees and

797
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,880
your

798
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,440
customers okay jay

799
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,799
so yeah i mean ransomware has been an

800
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,440
age-old question of

801
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,200
do i pay ransom do i not pay the most

802
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,799
being one of the proliferances was even

803
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,559
being arrested for paying a ransom and

804
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,360
keeping quiet

805
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,039
so classic example yesterday germany one

806
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,000
of the hospitals which was hit by a

807
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,080
ransomware

808
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,039
the emergency life support system for a

809
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,559
patient field

810
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,960
they could not give him access they

811
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,000
tried to shift him off but unfortunately

812
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,200
he passed away

813
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,600
but that's something which happened just

814
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,760
yesterday so

815
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,760
the rule of thumb which everyone

816
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,399
normally do follows is you don't pay

817
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,600
ransom

818
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,959
so having come from a financial sector

819
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,719
or banking background

820
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,640
especially if you are a dollar clearance

821
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,000
house you could lose your license if

822
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,559
you're paying ransom

823
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,320
and there has been some interesting ways

824
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,639
people have figured it out

825
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,639
they don't pay it as a direct ransom but

826
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,960
there are companies which do

827
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,000
use other channels and means of funding

828
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,039
these people

829
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,039
in return uh but i mean

830
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,559
generally speaking one of the best

831
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,279
things that i could tell you is all your

832
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,879
critical data have it backed up

833
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,200
make sure you have a running copies

834
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,840
that's where your pcp and your dr plans

835
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,080
come into play have a proper rpu rtu

836
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,000
assess your criticality of your business

837
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,279
and look at it from

838
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,039
not just for controlled segment but also

839
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,919
look at it from information and data

840
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,919
from methodology as well

841
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,080
so that yeah show some how many points i

842
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,919
have jay if you can add we have a

843
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,240
question about the vmware

844
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,440
client can can you uh answer this as

845
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,799
well

846
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,799
let me take a look at that one

847
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,440
is it connect is safe is it safe to

848
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,360
connect to a vmware client or is there a

849
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,000
potential risk so it again depends so if

850
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,760
you're using a vdi based distribution

851
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
depending on how you have configured it

852
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,000
and how we have set it up

853
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,879
it can be potentially harmless normally

854
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,919
for

855
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,200
servers and other critical assets

856
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,559
what we recommend is to do is you go

857
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,799
with the solution that often

858
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,080
offers you a zero trust based approach

859
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,679
uh like

860
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,360
i don't want to name products but there

861
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,640
are a couple of them in the market

862
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,719
available right now

863
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,960
which allows you to have an agent which

864
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,279
crossover validates authenticates and

865
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,640
gives you access to the authorized

866
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,399
requests

867
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,679
apart from that another way you can

868
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,320
actually manage it

869
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,640
is by having jump servers rather than

870
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,360
giving them a direct access to the vms

871
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,960
sure thank you uh yay we'll come back to

872
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,600
you for the question about the man in

873
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,000
the middle

874
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,678
in a second get your answer ready amit

875
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,640
can you share some

876
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:44,240
i want to say juicy story but something

877
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,240
that you can you know share with us

878
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,199
lately

879
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,840
so i i'll just i'll just share one

880
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,159
incident

881
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,840
uh i found like one of the the

882
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,399
organization would have having a

883
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,439
ransomware attack because of their c

884
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,000
source

885
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,799
so the entry point was the cso who was

886
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,120
continuously

887
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,360
giving webinars and somebody from i

888
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,000
think middle east

889
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,199
and shared a link to join that and he

890
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,480
clicked on that link

891
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,240
and then he was not able to join that

892
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,039
webinar eventually he downloaded that

893
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,640
client

894
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,320
and when he was still not able to join

895
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,399
that webinar he actually

896
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,039
uh removed like disable his firewall and

897
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,559
antivirus

898
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,080
because he thought like this is blocking

899
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,960
that entire system

900
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,480
and that made this entry point possible

901
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
to their servers and systems because

902
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,760
this laptop was having all the

903
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,559
permissions to access their servers

904
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,760
so the point is like anybody who is

905
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,600
actually holding such

906
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,600
serial positions vps and

907
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,880
admins they need to take care of

908
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,158
especially when they are actually doing

909
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,320
any such public

910
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,840
uh facing work they should not use the

911
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,039
same system they should use the print

912
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,559
system

913
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,720
because any of their mistake can

914
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,559
actually lead to such kind of series

915
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,919
okay yeah man in the middle i wanted to

916
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,039
add something regarding

917
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,679
ransomware don't the the

918
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,200
attitude should be don't think it will

919
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,000
not happen to me

920
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,960
think it will happen to me and if it

921
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,240
will happen

922
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:16,320
how much will i am i am willing to pay

923
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,679
and then take this budget and invest in

924
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:25,840
backups security and make it

925
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,840
not happen that's regarding what

926
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,480
stay on your side it will be on the

927
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,519
criminals

928
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,480
and regarding a man in the middle i

929
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,480
think it's the most

930
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,480
uh problematic

931
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,559
risk but i i think the solution

932
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,479
is to be to to look to

933
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:55,519
to be as the fourth guy and you have

934
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,559
the client the the server

935
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,840
the man in the middle if you have a

936
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,279
fourth one

937
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,959
to see all the three then

938
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,760
you can know there is a man in the

939
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,199
middle that's the only way

940
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,480
so i think they are solution going this

941
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,598
direction

942
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,480
and to check everything is the same no

943
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,200
one edited

944
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:25,599
ba between the two parties

945
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:28,719
okay i see um

946
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,919
do we see any pr prior uh

947
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:34,319
priority changes do we see oh i see the

948
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,520
mc is about to to waive us

949
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,800
um sorry to interrupt you sir no sir

950
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,119
sorry to interrupt you sir

951
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,480
so we have we got some questions also in

952
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,879
the question and answer session

953
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,399
so if you want to you can do that yeah

954
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,598
we we do that we go through the

955
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,078
questions all the time and the guys here

956
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,760
they will answer on the fly guys keep

957
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,520
keep on shooting questions

958
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,920
the experts are reading them all the

959
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,160
time and we are answering if something

960
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,000
is not answered please wave again

961
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,680
okay i think one of the most thought

962
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
about question right now that i can see

963
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,399
is

964
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,359
quite interesting are remote employees

965
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,000
facing

966
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,078
serious security risk while working

967
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,760
remotely

968
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,119
i guess by the end of this panel

969
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,560
discussion people should be able to

970
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,920
answer that

971
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,920
yeah but

972
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,680
yeah i think the answer would be is it

973
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,400
depends it pretty much depends on how

974
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,240
you have

975
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,920
set up your environment how do people

976
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,759
communicate what do they have

977
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,000
access to and how are you regulating uh

978
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,280
your data so some other people have even

979
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,240
mentioned below that

980
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,160
using a vpn is secured not necessarily

981
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,520
so it's not just about cyber security

982
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,960
that you would need to look at

983
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,800
or you would also need to look at it

984
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,040
from a bandwidth perspective

985
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,400
so for an sme or a small business

986
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,320
company it's fine

987
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,839
but imagine running in a commercial meet

988
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,000
or a large organization

989
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,880
where you normally have your vpn notes

990
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,599
catering for

991
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,839
1000 2000 people one fine morning you

992
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,680
have 50 000 staff working from

993
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,200
home it's gonna be a high impact so

994
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,118
there are challenges there are pros and

995
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,000
cons uh

996
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,200
can we be safe working from home it

997
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,920
pretty much depends on us

998
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,040
there's always the i or the human factor

999
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,680
in any security incident

1000
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,400
sure so guys we're getting uh close to

1001
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,640
the end

1002
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,920
i want you to to prepare some tips you

1003
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,118
know your one or two

1004
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,119
or three major tips about how should we

1005
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,000
work better although we answered most of

1006
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,320
it okay

1007
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,720
but still people are you know still

1008
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,599
unclear in its case by case it's very

1009
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,160
individual

1010
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,839
but for there's no question about it

1011
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,960
that

1012
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:46,400
businesses need to work and employees

1013
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,640
need jobs and they will work remotely

1014
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,720
and we will deal with the threats and

1015
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,598
hackers will be there forever like

1016
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,640
corona

1017
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,520
this this is the situation right now but

1018
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,160
we still

1019
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,960
need to keep on going humanity will not

1020
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,440
die over

1021
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,119
because of hackers or because of corona

1022
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,680
we just need to endure

1023
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,400
we need to come up with new creative

1024
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,480
ideas

1025
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,800
i think some of the audience here might

1026
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,640
have to you know pitch to you guys

1027
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,240
some of their ideas maybe some of their

1028
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,040
technologies also

1029
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,680
so a little bit of of tips how do you

1030
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,680
see things of you know progressing

1031
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,279
from here on amit if you would like to

1032
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,759
be the first to answer

1033
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,599
yeah sure so uh the very first tip that

1034
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,599
i would like to share with you all

1035
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,440
is like we need to uh increase the

1036
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,240
horizon of our information security

1037
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,160
policy

1038
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,359
it should not be limited to your own

1039
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,598
organization or it should

1040
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,880
cover the third party and fourth party

1041
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,440
vendors as well

1042
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,880
and you need to rate your all vendors

1043
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,800
against that risk

1044
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,720
and this could these could be your entry

1045
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,160
point they need to check whether they

1046
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,000
have ssl whether they have demar

1047
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,640
compliance whether they have

1048
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,720
issues in domain hijacking or mitm or

1049
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,078
email spoofing or any kind of

1050
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,000
social engineering based attack that

1051
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,240
could be possible with that organization

1052
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,400
you need to rate them as well normally

1053
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,720
we focus with our own organizations and

1054
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,960
we

1055
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,560
think like now we are secure enough but

1056
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,079
as i have shared initially like

1057
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,759
this is this is the biggest challenge

1058
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,119
that we have observed especially with

1059
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
the large organizations because they

1060
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,920
don't

1061
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,960
rate their own vendors a third and

1062
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,119
fourth party matters

1063
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,320
and the data is accessed to them as well

1064
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,440
this is very first thing that i would

1065
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,440
like to share second

1066
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,359
whatever soc is that we have security

1067
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,839
operation controls we need to take care

1068
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,279
of

1069
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,440
all these warnings and advisories

1070
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,160
seriously even if it has happened only

1071
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,040
once

1072
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,319
so most of uh the root cause analysis

1073
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,640
that i have done i found

1074
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,320
like these issues were already reported

1075
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,359
but they were not considered

1076
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,119
and not implemented in time so that

1077
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,119
the same can be replicated to other

1078
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,599
organizations so this is second thing

1079
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,440
that

1080
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,720
this is a continuous process we can't

1081
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,960
just

1082
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,720
do it once in a while or once in a month

1083
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,520
it has to be on a continuous basis

1084
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,959
because

1085
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,960
the attacks have become very

1086
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,599
sophisticated the mirrors are changing

1087
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,280
every day and if we are not updating our

1088
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,560
soft controls

1089
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,560
we will be always interested

1090
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,359
i guess my biggest step would be is to

1091
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,520
have awareness make sure everybody is

1092
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,520
educated made aware of it people go by

1093
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,800
what goes in whatsapp facebook or

1094
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,800
twitter even they don't even stop to

1095
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,320
think and validate the fact they just

1096
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,040
believe it and move on

1097
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,119
so i guess my number one tip would be to

1098
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:29,680
have awareness

1099
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:32,640
number two is be mindful of what you do

1100
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,879
so if you're unsure something is not

1101
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,359
safe always consult someone

1102
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,040
if not i would always say rejected

1103
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,759
there's no harm in not doing something

1104
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,599
because

1105
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,680
you're not comfortable or you're not

1106
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,440
sure what that leads to

1107
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,960
third one is make sure

1108
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,280
to actually practice a personal hygiene

1109
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,079
in terms of what is being done in your

1110
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,359
environment

1111
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,079
whether it's at your home or whether

1112
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,720
it's in your office uh having that cyber

1113
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,440
hygiene

1114
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,040
itself can actually reduce the risks

1115
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,119
that are associated with it

1116
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,400
making sure your machine is up to date

1117
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,240
having it backed up

1118
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,160
i mean people like me we don't even shut

1119
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,560
down our computers like

1120
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,399
we shut it down once a week maybe but

1121
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,880
practicing that habit of having these

1122
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,960
patches

1123
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,640
updated and rebooting it getting your

1124
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,400
system up and running

1125
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,839
those are some of the good things that

1126
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,520
can actually reduce the risk

1127
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,920
substantially okay thank you for this

1128
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,119
jay

1129
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,079
yeah go ahead your tips i can if you

1130
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,319
i can give a tip i learned as a pilot in

1131
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,520
the air force academy

1132
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,000
the one that will shoot you down is the

1133
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,599
one you

1134
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,800
don't see so don't think

1135
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,359
you see everything look around all the

1136
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,480
time

1137
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:51,040
look for the weak spots and don't think

1138
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,280
okay it's good if you think it's good

1139
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,240
you have to check again

1140
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,920
to see there's no vulnerability because

1141
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,759
the one you don't see

1142
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,720
it's the one to shoot you down clear

1143
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,160
so guys um i would like to thank you at

1144
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,560
this time

1145
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,480
we're still getting uh questions so i

1146
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,799
want to say to our audience first of all

1147

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,079
experience of this

1150
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,119

i'm telling you we are all on linkedin

1153
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,319
that would be the easiest way to go

1154
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,599
if you want to share any more questions

1155
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,000
if you wanna

1156
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,880
maybe offer solutions let me tell you

1157
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,119
right off

1158
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,800
these solutions needs to have need to

1159
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,960
have some traction

1160
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,240
don't just fire it as ideas i have an

1161
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,640
idea for this for that

1162
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,078
we cannot handle all this i mean these

1163
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,160
people are bombarded

1164
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,079
with technologies and startups left and

1165
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,598
right if you have something

1166
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,280
you need to have some you know

1167
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,359
credibility you need to show some

1168
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,680
customers you have to show the beginning

1169
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,720
of

1170
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,680
something for us to go a step forward

1171
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,200
and maybe

1172
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,759
look at it still still there is a wish

1173
