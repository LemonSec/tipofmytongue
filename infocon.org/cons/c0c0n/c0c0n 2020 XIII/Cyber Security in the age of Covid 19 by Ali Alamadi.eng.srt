today um today we i'll be talking about

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,120
cyber security and the age of covet 19

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,120
we have seen recently

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,199
that due to the pandemic that we have

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,120
been facing around the world

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,320
things have changed even in the cyber

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,519
world we have

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,440
a huge impact when it comes to

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
the cyber world and cyber attacks and

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,399
the attack trends

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,320
because since this started and a lot of

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,120
organization and a lot of individuals

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,399
were not ready for this pandemic

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,399
it had affected the way we live and

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,320
the way we work we started being very

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
dependent even more than before on

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,960
technology

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,720
many organization almost majority of the

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,320
organization around the world started

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,400
working remotely

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,439
we saw a huge increase in cyber attacks

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,320
when things started and they have been

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,919
manipulating a lot of individuals

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,000
when it comes to actually tricking them

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,720
and to making certain mistakes to make

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,119
sure that the attacks are successful

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,000
there has been so many different

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,040
breaches

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,200
on certain levels from governments to a

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,360
private companies

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,799
and of course us being more dependent

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,039
on the technologies have opened

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
more doors to even more risks when it

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,920
comes to

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,880
cyber attacks we see that

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,960
organizations are still not ready a lot

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,199
of organizations are still behind when

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,360
it comes to cyber security

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
they started providing the technology

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,160
for people to work remotely

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,920
but when it comes to ensuring security

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,359
while working remotely a lot of people

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,720
were not ready they didn't have the

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,760
right tools

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,000
their staff were not educated so

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,040
in the uae we started a huge campaign

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
across the country

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,200
trying to educate users that things are

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,720
a little bit different when you're

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,119
working from home

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
you need to keep in mind that the

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,239
attacks are increasing

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,920
uh people thought that everybody's

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,360
focusing on the

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,359
covet 19 virus itself hackers these are

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
normal individuals thought that hackers

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
don't care about the

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,879
attacking organizations anymore not

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,239
thinking that this is a great

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,359
opportunity

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,040
for these attackers to start and even

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
trick users

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,400
in a different way and use different

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,480
techniques

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,519
uh to ensure that people are actually

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,280
tricked and

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,920
provide them the information that they

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,360
need or make the mistakes that make the

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,958
attack successful

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
all the numbers that you see on the

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,200
screen and there are many statistics

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
show this increase and many

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,399
organizations have been facing so many

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
issues globally

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
when it comes to cyber attacks but there

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,840
has been

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,280
certain government initiatives in

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,360
certain countries and

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,599
certain entities have been taking

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,239
certain steps to make sure that they are

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,359
doing better and getting into a new

93
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,159
normal

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
that is also secure because working

95
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,640
remotely is not going away even

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,120
with today for example in the uae a lot

97
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,200
of entities have gone back to work

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,000
but they are making a lot of exceptions

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,879
in terms of certain parents need to um

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
still stand still work remotely because

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,920
their kids are

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,440
having remote learning and many such

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,518
exceptions

104
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,720
the biggest problem that we saw as well

105
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,720
that

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,439
there has been a lot of exceptions in

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,439
terms of

108
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,360
working remotely and that allowed

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,359
a lot of scams to happen as well so we

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,080
saw that there has been a huge increase

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
in terms of social engineering scams

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,000
because people

113
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,680
started working remotely people were not

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,040
educating

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,720
i mean all the cyber security

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,079
professionals were focusing on other

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,440
things they were forgot that the

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,280
awareness is still

119
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,520
a key element that we still need to

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,919
educate need to educate users

121
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,080
about the risks that out there so we saw

122
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,039
a new trend of social engineering

123
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,800
attacks and scams online where people

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,639
were receiving different emails

125
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,880
different sms and phone calls

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,320
and a lot of different communication

127
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,600
tools were used

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,000
as before to scam users but with new

129
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,080
scenarios that are more relevant

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,160
and of course everybody's talking about

131
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,080
the pandemic so they decided to use

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,840
the pandemic as the scenario to actually

133
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
ensure that their attacks are successful

134
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,880
when it comes to the fishing scams um

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,159
i'm sure it's the same

136
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,159
even in india there has been a lot of

137
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,639
phishing scams going around and we have

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
seen a lot of organizations be it public

139
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,919
or

140
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,239
private have been really facing issues

141
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,080
and there were successful attacks people

142
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
are clicking on links because

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,639
the scenarios that you use were quite

144
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,199
tricky in terms of telling people

145
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,720
that click on this link because you will

146
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,320
if you click on this link you will see

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
the latest list of

148
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,479
covered 19 patients for example in the

149
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,560
uae and people were clicking on the link

150
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,960
they were curious they wanted to know

151
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,639
information about the vaccine like the

152
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,039
example as you see on the screen

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,919
they were pretending to be world heart

154
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,680
organization

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,440
telling people about the updates that

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
are coming they knew that people would

157
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
click because people are interested this

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,600
is what is happening at the moment

159
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,880
this is the biggest concern the other

160
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,880
scenarios that they

161
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,440
use that became very common as well and

162
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,159
we saw huge attacks because of that

163
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,560
is that they pretended to be from the

164
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,560
i.t

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,160
department or the security team trying

166
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
to trick people

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,400
to click on links as by telling them

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,400
that we want to ensure

169
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,680
we enroll you in a certain security

175
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
program a lot of these kind of things

176
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
and scams have been used

177
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,719
to ensure that people actually install

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
certain malware

179
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
malicious code on their machines or

180
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,400
provide their credentials

181
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
so this has been going on and we have

182
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,719
been trying to educate

183
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,039
everybody that

184
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,479
be careful do not click on these links

185
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,680
and i have been working on this for a

186
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,919
while now

187
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000
i started my career actually doing these

188
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,198
sessions and doing a lot of training and

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,240
education

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,000
and it's a shame that until today there

191
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,039
are individuals who are

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,880
not at that level of awareness and they

193
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,840
are still not even aware about the

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,120
basics

195
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,520
of security and best practices

196
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,240
we started talking about remote working

197
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,719
so much

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
because it became the new normal people

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,479
are working from home

200
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,919
people started working from different

201
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,039
remote sites and

202
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,359
the question that was asked by so many

203
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,680
users unfortunately it was not

204
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,039
answered on time there was a delay in

205
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,759
telling people

206
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,159
how to work securely then later on

207
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,960
people

208
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,720
started starting these awareness

209
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,560
programs to educate people but it came a

210
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,759
little bit late and during that period

211
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,520
from march when we

212
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,160
in the ue we started the lockdown from

213
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,359
march from march to april and may we saw

214
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,680
a lot of attacks

215
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,199
and then by june and july people started

216
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,879
being a little bit more aware

217
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,639
but of course still there are so many

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,520
targeted attacks happening

219
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,520
even in the uae

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,199
we started educating people about having

221
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,000
a

222
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,599
dedicated workspace unfortunately we saw

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,639
so many mistakes

224
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,639
because people just didn't think people

225
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,639
thought that it's okay to take company

226
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,560
devices with them suddenly overnight

227
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,120
everybody's asked

228
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,479
to work from home either now we had two

229
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,639
cases either work

230
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,199
from home using their individual devices

231
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,720
which was even more dangerous because

232
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,560
we didn't know what are the security

233
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,319
settings on these devices and if they

234
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,120
are aware how to protect these devices

235
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,039
or not

236
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
and we had another group where they

237
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,039
actually rushed into providing laptops

238
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,919
to their or the devices

239
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,000
for their employees to work from home

240
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,559
without guiding them the right way to do

241
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
it

242
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,640
and people ignored physical security at

243
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
home people would keep their laptops in

244
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,679
the uae it's very hot and the heat and

245
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,518
the dust

246
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,199
without thinking that this can actually

247
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,240
damage the devices

248
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,399
some departments asked to take their

249
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,560
their files with them home like the

250
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,560
human resources or people who work still

251
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,319
with some papers and contracts

252
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,680
and unfortunately there was a lot of

253
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
data loss as well

254
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,519
because people don't didn't think that

255
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,000
the kids might damage these files or if

256
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,120
they had

257
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
some pits at home they might damage the

258
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
files

259
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,519
so they didn't think of it from that

260
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,279
perspective and that had

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,800
some impact on some of the organizations

262
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,200
so that's the first thing we tell

263
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,399
users prepare a dedicated workspace if

264
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,480
you don't have an office

265
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,640
at least have somewhere secure at your

266
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,560
home that you can show you can lock

267
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,640
the file so nobody has access to it in a

268
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,640
locked cabinet put the devices in

269
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,279
somewhere that is protected from heat

270
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,439
from

271
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,439
the kids and all of the other aspects

272
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,080
another thing that became very normal

273
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,080
suddenly people sharing information from

274
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,240
work with their families and friends

275
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,399
they are actually working from home

276
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,680
having these conference calls and i even

277
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,440
saw it at home here in

278
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,800
my own house and i started telling my

279
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,640
family don't do that

280
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
they are doing conference calls and

281
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,920
having meetings remotely

282
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,279
and the whole family members are sitting

283
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,199
around and listening

284
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,279
forgetting that these people are not

285
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
authorized to hear such information

286
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,480
a lot of confidential information might

287
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
have been leaked

288
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
yes there is a trust with the family but

289
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,279
then again

290
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,079
are they authorized or not that's a

291
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,000
different question so we really need to

292
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,680
think and lift security and if we don't

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,839
think about these small things i know

294
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,519
the family members will not steal

295
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,120
the information but they might share

296
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,320
that information with some friends and

297
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,959
then other friends and then other

298
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,200
friends

299
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,800
and that might reach someone who might

300
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,800
have some bad intentions

301
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,920
of course email has been the most common

302
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,800
communication tool in the past

303
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,240
it became even more used during these

304
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,959
days because we

305
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,000
we tried to avoid having face-to-face

306
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,479
meetings

307
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,720
we didn't want to have any um

308
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,519
social gatherings or any meetings in the

309
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,839
office

310
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,160
so we wanted to maintain the social

311
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
distancing so email was even more used

312
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,000
for communication

313
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,920
but still the mistakes are there a lot

314
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,240
of confidential data was sent

315
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,519
in clear text over email without any

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,120
encryption most of the

317
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,640
unfortunately most of the organizations

318
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,839
do not have the guidelines

319
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,160
and the tools for their users that how

320
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,279
to

321
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,600
send any confidential data across

322
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,200
even if you're using email to encrypt it

323
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,920
or use any other tools

324
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,240
that is sent in a secure manner and the

325
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,719
other shocking part for me was that

326
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,399
until today majority of the entities do

327
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,480
not have any secure

328
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,680
portal or any way that you can upload

329
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
large files

330
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,519
and send it in a secure way over secure

331
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
connection

332
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,720
to another person who's authorized to

333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,720
see that information

334
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,160
the use of personal email became very

335
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
common for work

336
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,319
and this is of course not acceptable but

337
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,079
people thought it's normal now that i'm

338
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,560
working from home let me use my

339
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,239
my personal email to work to send work

340
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,839
information and that is of course

341
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,680
not correct so there are a lot of things

342
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,279
that we try to educate people when it

343
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,199
comes to that aspect

344
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,000
but unfortunately a lot of people just

345
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,920
didn't pay attention to that

346
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
another thing that became common is

347
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,279
people working from home connecting

348
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,200
through their wi-fi

349
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,880
none of the organization and i didn't

350
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,079
see that even online that

351
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,079
came later on educating people on how to

352
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,560
secure their wi-fi

353
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,519
people forget us as security

354
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,599
professional

355
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,279
we tend to forget that people at home

356
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
are not tech savvys they don't

357
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,920
understand the security best practices

358
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,599
so their wi-fi's might be open there

359
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,279
might not be even any password or

360
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,079
encryption or nothing used on their

361
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,760
wi-fi

362
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,079
and a lot of entities didn't even give

363
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
up vpn because there were license issues

364
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,719
there were a lot of issues that they

365
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,920
didn't even give a vpn

366
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,880
client for their employees to connect

367
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,760
securely

368
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,560
so we had a lot of issues there as well

369
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,959
that people

370
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,199
and after opening up as well so we had a

371
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,359
lockdown for a period and then people

372
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
were allowed to go out and now things

373
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
are normal people go out and all but

374
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,040
still we say maintain the

375
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,040
social distancing but people still go to

376
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,319
restaurants or people work in cafes and

377
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,279
connect to open

378
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
public wi-fi and again in terms of

379
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,600
awareness

380
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,279
a lot of people who are not aware about

381
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,279
the dangers of connecting

382
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,639
to an untrusted wi-fi connection and

383
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,800
sending information

384
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,800
that is confidential and clear text

385
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,279
we go to the basics and this is what

386
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,519
surprises me so much

387
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,680
that until today and i have done

388
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,360
thousands of sessions across the country

389
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,279
i have done even sessions outside in

390
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,040
india and other countries as well

391
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,519
and i still see that some people are not

392
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,760
even aware about the basics

393
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,760
people are still sharing their digital

394
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,959
identity people are still sharing their

395
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,800
passwords and

396
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,399
the common thing that i've seen with the

397
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,719
remote working and with the current

398
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,160
pandemic situation people think it's

399
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,120
okay to share their

400
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,120
device credentials with their family

401
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,040
members because they are at home

402
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,720
maybe their kid wants to use the laptop

403
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,360
or something for work

404
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,720
or remote learning or whatever and they

405
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,760
give them the credentials they think

406
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,519
it's fine

407
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,760
the use of two-factor of multi-factor

408
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,800
authentication is still not common

409
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,199
and that is very easy to implement and

410
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,839
most of the excuses that i have heard

411
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,680
from organizations oh it's annoying

412
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,279
people don't like it our staff will

413
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,120
complain

414
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,320
so this is something that i've seen a

415
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,480
lot of people

416
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
are still not following using default

417
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,440
passwords

418
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,079
not implementing password security

419
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,480
policy from a technical perspective

420
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,000
on your systems so these are the basics

421
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,880
that anybody can do but

422
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,639
still we are missing that so we need to

423
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,079
educate people and we really need to

424
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,360
provide the tools

425
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,719
to make sure that people can actually

426
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,639
follow these best practices

427
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,440
and stop sharing their identities with

428
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,440
their colleagues or their family members

429
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,040
all of that whatever it's common and

430
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,279
causes a lot of data leakage

431
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,120
we started using collaboration tools we

432
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,839
didn't have that in the past it was not

433
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,680
that common

434
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,680
in the uae we rarely had any um

435
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,680
let's say remote meetings every meeting

436
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,319
was happening face to face

437
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,479
we used to go and visit our customers

438
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,920
and sit with them and talk and elaborate

439
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,040
and talk about something confidential

440
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,880
not confidential

441
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,079
it didn't matter but we always had

442
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,240
physical meetings

443
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,680
now that we are using these these

444
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,279
collaboration tools

445
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,359
a lot of people forgot that these

446
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,439
collaboration tools might have certain

447
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,600
vulnerabilities and weaknesses

448
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,560
people didn't even think i mean people

449
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,720
are using zoom

450
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,638
microsoft teams so many of them there

451
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,120
were a lot of security features

452
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,639
and more were introduced later on

453
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,560
because this became more common

454
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,920
depending on these um

455
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,399
organizations depending on these

456
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,040
collaboration tools so we were telling

457
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,959
all these organizations have you thought

458
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,160
about the security of these tools before

459
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,399
using them

460
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,399
most of them said no we just needed it

461
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,519
it was urgent have you educated your

462
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,560
people

463
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,320
not to click on links or a lot of

464
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,719
we have this common thing happening now

465
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,360
a lot of organizations are sending

466
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,759
invitations or to emails to many users

467
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,519
and telling them during these webinars

468
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,040
and a lot of these entities are not

469
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,560
trusted these

470
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,480
organizations who pretend that they are

471
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,239
doing webinars they might send links and

472
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,759
ask the users to click on it

473
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,399
and that might have some kind of

474
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,680
negative impact and install a malware or

475
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,519
something like that

476
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,359
so a lot of these things people are not

477
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,959
even locking the meetings i've seen

478
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,839
whoever has the link can click and come

479
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,758
in um disabling file transfer

480
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,160
enabling waiting rooms there are so many

481
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,199
security settings that you can put

482
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,680
from um it perspective and then

483
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,880
educate the users they have some

484
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,560
security settings

485
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,560
and settings that they can use as

486
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,199
organizers of the meeting as well

487
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,758
to ensure that there is no data leaked

488
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
and

489
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,399
for example not allowing recording we

490
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,160
saw a lot of recordings happening

491
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,920
in many meetings that confidential

492
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,920
information was discussed

493
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,120
and a lot of people found out later on

494
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,279
that the

495
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,240
the person who joined have recorded the

496
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,079
session

497
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,360
and or the host recorded the session

498
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,439
without telling them

499
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,520
so that created a lot of issues between

500
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,559
vendors and organizations

501
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,559
and vice versa

502
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,160
another thing that we saw that is even

503
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,760
more common now than before people

504
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,480
creating groups on whatsapp

505
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,679
and organizations and starting to share

506
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,439
information on

507
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
work information over whatsapp because

508
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,679
it's so easy on social media to share

509
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,678
information we are so used to whatsapp

510
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,799
so they are whatsapping these files

511
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,720
without thinking and

512
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,720
all the people say yeah but that's

513
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,039
secure it's encrypted

514
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,799
it doesn't matter this is not a

515
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,640
platform that is owned by your

516
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,760
organization we tell them and in the ua

517
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,080
for example

518
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,360
there are laws that prevent governments

519
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,240
from putting their

520
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,600
information on a cloud that is outside

521
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,280
the uae

522
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,559
so you cannot host your government

523
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
information outside uae without

524
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,960
permission

525
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,120
and a lot of people are just sharing

526
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,600
these confidential files over whatsapp

527
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,120
or without thinking and they don't use

528
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,879
the proper channels maybe because the

529
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,719
organization did not provide it

530
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,640
so we need to really think and the

531
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,480
information classification became even

532
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,960
more important than before

533
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,520
that educate your users tell them about

534
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,039
this

535
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,960
and tell them what is allowed to be

536
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,960
shared through this platform and what

537
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,120
it's not allowed to share to be shared

538
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,200
through these platforms using different

539
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,600
kind of technologies that are online

540
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,679
and third-party applications are of

541
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,840
course always not recommended if you

542
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
don't have control over it

543
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,799
yes we saw organizations giving so many

544
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,240
exceptions we had two cases the

545
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,320
organizations that

546
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,080
provided laptops to their users gave

547
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,760
them a lot of exceptions they allowed

548
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,840
them to use removal media

549
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,600
because it was much easier it didn't

550
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,159
have time to help them

551
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,080
they allow them to install software

552
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,480
without guidance

553
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,918
all these exceptions are very dangerous

554
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
basically you're breaching your own

555
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,600
security policies

556
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,200
without thinking and yes it will make

557
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,559
their life easier in terms of

558
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,160
operations but security is hugely

559
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,039
impacted when you do such

560
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,880
such mistakes and then there was another

561
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,760
group of entities many many

562
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
organizations

563
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,520
where they allowed their users to just

564
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,600
use their own devices

565
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,120
have you educated this is the question

566
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,080
that you need to ask yourself have you

567
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,959
educated

568
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,799
your staff are my staff at a certain

569
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,640
level of maturity when it comes to

570
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,559
awareness that i can allow them

571
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,160
to use their machines to how do i have

572
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,399
the right controls in place

573
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,440
have i educated them about updating and

574
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,320
patching their

575
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,760
or operating systems and devices

576
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,600
regularly have i told them

577
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,000
what is the trusted antivirus maybe i

578
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,320
give them an antivirus to install

579
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,840
on their machines have they have i told

580
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,039
them about backup if they are

581
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,720
storing work information on

582
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,320
on certain devices do i have mobile

583
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,760
device management do i have mobile

584
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,720
application management

585
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,000
solutions do i have all these controls

586
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,080
to see what is happening

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,679
outside my organization and how are they

588
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,120
dealing and exchanging with

589
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,120
organization data unfortunately majority

590
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,199
of the organizations did not ask that

591
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,120
question and we had so

592
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
much data leakage happening because of

593
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,158
that so

594
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,919
make sure that i would rather the

595
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,640
employee sit idle

596
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,200
not work until i prepare and get the

597
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,200
budget for those devices for the laptops

598
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,320
so that he can work remotely then give

599
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,559
him the laptop

600
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,840
continue working but continue working on

601
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,320
securely so

602
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,918
that was a debate that we had operations

603
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,799
versus security

604
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,200
uh of course you have to think about

605
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,960
security more

606
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,280
a lot of organizations didn't even have

607
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,919
the policies and procedures in place

608
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,600
and maybe the pandemic was a wake-up

609
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,679
call for a lot of organizations

610
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,520
that are you ready for security have you

611
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,200
ever thought about working remotely

612
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,799
because anything can happen disasters

613
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,120
can happen all the time

614
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,080
and maybe it's not all global maybe it's

615
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,000
something that happens

616
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,120
within your organization are you ready

617
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,960
for that a lot of people

618
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,280
started talking about business

619
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,520
continuity as well in the country and

620
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,280
i was happy about that that people are

621
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,280
really thinking now about

622
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,678
worst case scenario thinking about what

623
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,480
can happen in terms of availability

624
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,200
and in terms of uh security continuity

625
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,559
as well

626
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,240
so we started guiding a lot of entities

627
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,840
and a lot of entities started drafting

628
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,960
policies and procedures giving the

629
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,439
guidelines

630
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,200
and ensuring that their staff are really

631
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,000
compliant with such

632
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,000
regulations or let's say policy

633
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,640
statements while working remotely as

634
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
well

635
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,039
so this is something that you must have

636
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,640
because you cannot educate every single

637
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,840
user it's difficult you have new

638
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,360
employees every time

639
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,080
they need to have a reference people

640
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,840
forget you have to think that your

641
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,720
people your staff don't know anything

642
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,840
have the

643
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,159
basics documented as well let them read

644
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,600
let them educate themselves and keep

645
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,360
reminding themselves

646
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,360
how to follow security best practice

647
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,360
finally reporting incidents reporting

648
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,280
incidents and security weaknesses were

649
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,639
important before but now even more

650
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,158
important than before

651
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,000
because people are sitting at home

652
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,000
facing a lot of issues and if they don't

653
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,120
directly talk to your it help desk or

654
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,760
talk to

655
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,479
any um any team that you have put in

656
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,480
place to

657
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,600
do incident handling and take these

658
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,039
calls

659
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,879
they will not know because a lot of

660
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,158
things might be happening outside

661
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,400
the the network or the

662
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,080
infrastructure of your organization and

663
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,720
you might not be aware of it and that

664
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,240
might cause

665
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,120
a lot of huge impacts in terms of your

666
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,840
reputation

667
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,600
financial or any other way that

668
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,199
depending on the attack of course

669
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,918
so make sure that you have the lines

670
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,000
established educate people put a certain

671
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,600
dedicated line make it 24 hours that's

672
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,600
even more preferred

673
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,120
preferred put the right tools for

674
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,639
monitoring as well so you can have

675
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,000
better detection

676
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,799
and of course that can prevent

677
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,640
a lot of attacks so yes we are living a

678
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,320
different in a different world now

679
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,520
things are different we are working

680
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,039
remotely

681
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,120
and the way we used to think about

682
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,080
security has to change as well

683
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,479
from if you are a normal user or an i.t

684
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,720
specialist or a security specialist

685
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,240
things have changed and we have to

686
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,200
change our mentality

687
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,880
in terms of the way we use we exchange

688
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
information and deal with information

689
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,280
and the way we do things online as well

690
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,640
so we have to be even extra careful and

691
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,799
more vigilant

692
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,640
on and more careful on what we do and

693
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,559
all the activities that we

694
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,240
do while working or on a personal level

695
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,399
as well to protect

696
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,679
our personal information i would like to

697
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,159
thank you so much

698
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,600
for tuning in and listening to my

699
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,640
presentation

700
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:47,840
and wish you all good health

701
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,840
and stay safe thank you very much
