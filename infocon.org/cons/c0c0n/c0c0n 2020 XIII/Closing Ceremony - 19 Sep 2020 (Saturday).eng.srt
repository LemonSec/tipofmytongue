2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,400
good morning

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,880
good afternoon good evening to the

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,720
global audience of cocoon

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,640
it's finally curtains for cocoon 2020

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,519
the international security and hacking

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,040
conference organized by kerala police

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,120
israel and the pulsar this conference

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,120
was something special

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,399
because we started it on a virtual

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,640
platform

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,239
when we started off we were skeptical

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
whether this would be a successful

14
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,360
conference itself

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,520
but the deliberations and the

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,000
discussions over the past two days

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,680
have proved that this cocoon was one of

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,879
the most successful ones

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,719
even in the history of cocoon we are

20
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,119
living in a totally virtual world

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,520
we all understand that technology has

22
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,479
become a part of our lives

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,000
it has changed the basic way that we

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,880
survive our goal about our

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
business we require digital resources

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,560
for everything

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,280
the way we shop the way we go about our

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,880
business the way we educate our children

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
have all changed because of this

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,280
technological advancement

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,799
but with this technon technological

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,360
advancement also

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,360
has come the dark world of cyber crimes

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,880
in the past six months during the

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,200
lockdown period

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,560
we have seen a great upsurge in cyber

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,720
crimes

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,439
it's but natural that most of the people

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,720
were hooked on to their devices

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,000
and we find that cyber crime has gone up

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,000
really drastically whether you look at

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,040
crimes against women and children

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
they look at bank frauds or data hacks

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
that are happening

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,798
all have gone up in the past six months

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,159
in this cocoon conference

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,759
for the last two days we have

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,679
deliberated on the latest cyber crimes

49
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,599
the tools and techniques available to

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,040
deal with such cyber crimes

51
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,040
and the policy changes which the

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
government needs to introduce

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,160
to really handle these crimes

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,958
effectively

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,359
cocoon has always been a platform where

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,640
the stakeholders in cyber security have

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
come together

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,319
the five important piece namely the

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,640
press

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,518
the political leadership the police

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,160
department

62
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,959
and the public and private sector all

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,519
five stakeholders need to come together

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,319
to formulate a proper policy of cyber

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,040
security

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,958
in this cyber in this cocoon conference

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,560
we have seen all these five important

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,560
piece coming together

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
deliberating and discussing on important

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,760
aspects

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,040
to build a safer cyber secure world

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,599
that's why it has been a highly

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,720
successful conference

74
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,879
cocoon is now 13 years old and we have

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,879
come a long way

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,679
the first conference we started off with

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:11,120
just 100 delegates

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,840
last year we had around 1 800 delegates

79
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,319
attending from 40 odd countries

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
and this conference we have more than

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,799
5000 delegates attending from

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,959
all around the globe and this conference

83
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,440
is primarily being beamed

84
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,519
to more than 4 million people over the

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,680
social media handles

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
this is truly a virtual and global

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
conference

88
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
in this conference also we have

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,840
generated a lot of ideas out of the

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,440
deliberations and discussions

91
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,920
from all the stakeholders that are

92
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,959
available and i'm sure

93
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,798
these ideas can be developed into

94
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,440
strategies and policies

95
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,400
which are going to really contribute the

96
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,920
development

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,239
