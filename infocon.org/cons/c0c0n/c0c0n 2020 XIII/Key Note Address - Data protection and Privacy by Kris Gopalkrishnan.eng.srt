1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,160
uh two

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,359
aspects actually one is from the aspect

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
of

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:14,400
data and how data has become

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,760
very very important for

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,359
all of us and second based on some of

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,640
the newer technologies

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,199
especially ai and machine learning

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:31,840
which is more and more used in the area

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,840
of cyber security

11
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,519
ah there seems to be a delay between

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,199
uh okay

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,480
so um if you look at

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,079
the news that came out recently

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:59,760
uh when twitter was hacked

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:03,359
and um about 150 accounts of very very

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,560
uh important people were taken over

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,560
for a few minutes uh especially if you

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,720
see on the bottom right

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,680
uh even president barack obama's

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,320
account was taken over people like elon

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,439
musk

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,119
joe biden all these accounts were taken

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,919
over

25
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,200
there are two messages i want to share

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,360
in this regard

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,680
one uh the

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,000
you know the accounts of very important

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,119
people were taken over and if their

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,560
accounts

31
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:42,159
are not protected then what about

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,680
you and me second

33
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,880
twitter is in the midst of the center

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,079
of the i.t

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,119
ecosystem in the silicon valley and they

36
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,919
have the best and

37
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,520
best of the resources in spite of that

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,719
they got hacked

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,240
and that also says that um

40
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,280
you know if twitter was hacked

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,519
then um you know it's possible

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,319
that any website can be hacked any data

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,560
can be hacked now in this case what

44
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,839
happened was

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,239
twitter had allowed about i think 1500

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,000
employees

47
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
you know access through an admin

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,879
app to access the accounts for fixing

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,640
problems etc and

50
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,799
it seems the the hackers

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,119
got through to one of two of these

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,599
employees we don't know how many

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
got the access to the admin window and

54
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,399
through that main window

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,799
they were able to change these

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,519
take over these accounts and this is

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
typical

58
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,239
you know most of the cases 30 to 40

59
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,680
percent of the cases

60
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,840
the accounts the hacking

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,480
happens through employees within the

62
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,800
organization and

63
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,399
that is why sometimes it's actually very

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,519
very difficult

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,720
to prevent hacking

66
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,840
but you can protect based on

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
some of the things that i will talk

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
about

69
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,680
let me now switch to india

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,680
over the last few months especially

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,959
during this pandemic

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,159
the cyber attacks in india has actually

73
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,480
surged and the news item

74
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,720
the middle says that india is among the

75
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,079
top five most targeted

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,120
by the hackers

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,200
and and the bottom uh

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,159
says that even hospitals are

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,679
not out of the purview of hackers

80
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,760
actually

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:03,599
hospitals which are providing

82
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,519
services are also part of the hacking

83
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,119
actually so they don't

84
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,080
discriminate even the most important or

85
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
most

86
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,360
critical resources all of them are

87
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,119
hacked

88
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,799
again it says that this is something

89
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,639
widespread and

90
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,599
we need to protect our verses from

91
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,600
these hackers

92
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,199
let me now illustrate through a couple

93
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,360
of examples i won't go into all of them

94
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
and are the challenges that we are faced

95
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,840
with you know

96
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,440
all of us are familiar with uh the right

97
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,719
hailing apps like ola or

98
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,400
uber etc now if you are able to hack

99
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,680
into let us say

100
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,080
uh the the data from the right-handling

101
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
companies actually it does where all

102
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,960
your travel

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,600
with whom if you are going to do right

104
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,599
sharing you have travel

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,360
the timing of your travel the payment

106
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,120
details and from this

107
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,759
actually you can actually figure out now

108
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,120
if you are let's say

109
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,479
going to the bank every monday

110
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,120
right because you know from um

111
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,560
you know where you have to where you're

112
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,759
traveling

113
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:25,919
uh then you you can you can actually

114
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:29,520
plan a activity around that

115
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,719
now if you are going to a particular

116
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,039
shopping area work space they can figure

117
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,800
out your work area and things like that

118
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,719
so you know with the data you are able

119
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,400
to actually figure out a lot

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,680
about the individual and the same is

121
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,599
true you know if you lose

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,800
your mobile phone if your mobile phone

123
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
gets hacked

124
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,000
in fact you know the the hackers can

125
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,198
get access to your uh search details

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,160
your browsing details uh the content

127
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,880
that you look at

128
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,840
um the friends that you have the social

129
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,400
networking

130
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,119
handles that you have the emails that

131
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
you have

132
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
everything they are able to get access

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,360
to

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,479
if you hack into the neighborhood

135
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,759
pharmacy

136
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,960
the medicines that you buy what

137
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,639
illnesses that you have how many people

138
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,080
are there at your home

139
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,120
all kinds of things and there are

140
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
positive benefits to public data sets

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,400
also

142
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
if you look at the gst network data for

143
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,479
example

144
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,960
it has about one crore msme's uh data

145
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,560
from

146
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,599
one pro and msme you know micro

147
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,440
small medium enterprises and over that

148
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,039
now there are services being rendered

149
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,599
which allows

150
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,880
credit facilities to be given you know

151
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,880
loans to be given to

152
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,240
msmes etc so again you know the data

153
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:04,080
is extremely

154
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,199
important it can be put to bad

155
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,960
uses or it can be put to good uses

156
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:14,319
also so

157
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,840
all of us have accelerated the adoption

158
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,919
of

159
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,039
digital life especially during the

160
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,479
pandemic

161
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,800
and in the context of

162
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,680
digital life and that's the life that we

163
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,039
are all you know

164
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,960
all of us are using

165
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,039
digital more than ever before

166
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,520
so during the pandemic of course the

167
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,039
adoption is accelerated

168
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,240
and if you look at uh the devices that

169
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,560
we are using

170
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,319
to access the internet or access the

171
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,160
phone network

172
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,960
and through which of course access all

173
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,560
the services access

174
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,758
internet and things like that you know

175
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,800
these devices are manufactured around

176
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,840
the world

177
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,840
supply chains are global so

178
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,080
you know if you look at the iphone for

179
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,840
example you know the components come

180
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,240
from all over the world actually finally

181
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,520
it gets assembled in india now

182
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,840
or in china uh the

183
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,758
the chips could come from some places

184
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,719
typically taiwan or something like that

185
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,440
and uh

186
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,400
or korea um you know some other

187
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
communists coming

188
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,280
from japan etc uh that's

189
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,039
our another story actually the apps

190
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,159
could come from

191
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,360
all over the world and and and a lot of

192
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,560
the ads we don't even

193
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,839
check where it's coming from who is the

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,880
uh you know the author and

195
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
or which company created this etc and

196
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,480
and

197
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,480
again that's a vulnerability and lots of

198
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,920
apps have back door entries and things

199
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,200
like that

200
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,439
increased use of iot devices

201
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,480
and i have another slide on iot so i'll

202
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
talk about it

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,480
there but more and more our lives are

204
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,399
now dependent on these iot devices

205
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,600
similarly transaction data which is

206
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,839
voluntary or involuntary so for example

207
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,959
you know the the voluntary part of the

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,320
data

209
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,239
is um you know simply um

210
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
the you know for example the right

211
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,839
healing apps the credit card transaction

212
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,399
there's a warranty you know we paid

213
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,080
for that but the involuntary is our

214
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,640
habits and things like that are all

215
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
getting

216
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,880
locked uh if you if you

217
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,519
uh walk along the street for example now

218
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,600
you may get

219
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,680
uh you may get uh

220
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,880
recorded you know video recorded and

221
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,640
things like that right that's

222
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,200
involuntary you know you didn't

223
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,080
you didn't allow for that but you are

224
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,519
already getting

225
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,560
recorded um and and many places

226
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,560
automatically it

227
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,518
is tracking you actually on

228
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,279
on the cloud we store now lots and lots

229
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,399
of data personal data

230
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,279
again we trust the service provider

231
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,279
but massive amounts of data is being

232
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,760
generated by every one of us

233
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,439
in the digital life in the in this

234
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,880
digital world

235
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,240
and you know we are actually

236
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,959
uh not completely aware of know what is

237
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,160
happening

238
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:21,199
to this data so for example

239
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,719
if you you know do a search

240
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,880
and then you go to let's say facebook or

241
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,320
you go to a social media network the

242
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,480
ads that are served to you actually

243
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
follows the search that you did how did

244
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,079
it come to know

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,279
that is because the search entity

246
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,239
company has sold

247
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,880
your browsing information to the social

248
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,560
media

249
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,040
network so that they can serve

250
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,319
appropriate hacks and things like that

251
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,360
so this is why it starts spreading uh

252
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,760
the use of data uh you know is

253
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,000
is uh used or misused to serve you

254
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
uh you know in the future we are going

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
to have

256
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,120
50 to 60 billion connected devices

257
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,399
appliances machines

258
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,399
etc everything from healthcare

259
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,959
to smart factories to intelligent

260
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,600
buildings to smart cities

261
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,800
connected cars drone security devices

262
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,279
that are watching you

263
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:22,959
every one of these is actually a

264
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,760
a possible vulnerability

265
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,319
and the data from these and imagine that

266
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,360
50 to 60 billion devices

267
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,720
and all of them manufactured

268
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
in different parts of the world

269
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,000
components coming from different parts

270
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
of the world

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,040
you don't know who has certified these

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,519
etc

273
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,399
all of these are floating around in the

274
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,880
future

275
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,760
and all of them are actually logging

276
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,040
data

277
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,720
about you

278
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:57,199
and and this data is a huge

279
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:01,279
huge source of services

280
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,800
but also a significant vulnerability

281
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,600
today the regulations around the use of

282
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,760
data

283
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,360
is still not clear india is in the

284
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,000
process of

285
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,200
coming out with personal data protection

286
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,760
regulations

287
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,000
uh i myself chair the non-personal data

288
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,839
framework committee framing the rules

289
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,079
and regulations on non-personal data

290
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,760
and the the ownership of this data

291
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,439
is still not very clear uh most of us

292
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,279
when we allow uh

293
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,720
let's say a particular service to be

294
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,480
delivered and it

295
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,360
is tracking you you typically say

296
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,959
you know i allow uh if you think about

297
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
you know when you go to a website and

298
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,399
says

299
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,720
it's using cookies you say yes go ahead

300
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
right we don't even go back and check

301
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,000
what it's doing

302
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,079
with this data and there's no disclosure

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,200
also

304
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,839
the the personal data in many cases is

305
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,399
stored

306
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,200
in different countries actually not

307
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,320
necessarily in india

308
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,519
uh data of course is a very huge

309
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,360
business if you look at the top five

310
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,760
companies in the world

311
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,519
uh you know companies like google

312
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,480
facebook

313
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,760
amazon all these companies have huge

314
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,399
amount of data

315
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,600
and their market cap their valuation is

316
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,920
dependent on how much

317
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,800
data that they have and these are

318
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,319
humongous

319
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,279
companies with my trillion dollar plus

320
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,639
valuations actually so there is need for

321
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,600
national regulations

322
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,760
and this is uh what every country is now

323
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,959
grappling with and we in india are also

324
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,000
looking at

325
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,359
clear regulations on ownership of data

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,600
typically ownership of the data resides

327
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,040
with the data principle which is

328
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,760
the person about whom this data is

329
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,839
about right the owner of the data is the

330
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,600
subject of the data itself

331
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,560
and we need to authorize the use of this

332
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
data

333
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,920
and we need to authorize for specific

334
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,560
purposes

335
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,639
and that's what this regulation will

336
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,160
actually specify

337
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,680
and also uh more and more i personally

338
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,959
believe that

339
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,839
there has to be disclosure based use of

340
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,760
data

341
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,760
rather than uh consent based yes consent

342
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,720
is okay if um the principle that is you

343
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,519
and me

344
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,360
are fully aware of what is being done

345
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,399
with this data but when

346
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,199
that's not very clear the disclosure

347
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
is probably what is more important

348
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,599
transparency

349
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,040
is what important and lastly

350
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,040
this is nothing to do with cyber

351
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,160
security but it is

352
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,319
to do with wealth generation the wealth

353
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,360
generated from this data must accrue to

354
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,320
the country the citizens of that country

355
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,560
so shifting the focus to transparency as

356
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,519
a way to level the playing field

357
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,880
ensuring the privacy of the data this

358
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,839
stays with the data

359
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,839
principle

360
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,320
and you know when you think about

361
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,720
data some of the questions that uh you

362
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,759
know

363
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,000
come to mind are uh

364
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,800
you know i talked about you know search

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,880
how does it

366
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,079
influence online use and tracking do you

367
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,920
know that

368
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,519
what cookies are being used how it's

369
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,319
tracking you

370
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,720
uh where are the data traverses and can

371
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,639
be potentially captured and tracked

372
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,079
you know starting with the router that

373
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,720
you have

374
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,160
to the routers on the internet to the

375
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,680
servers on the internet

376
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,240
to service providers on the on

377
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,599
on the app and things like that and and

378
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
it can be actually

379
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,120
in different different geographical

380
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,920
locations now who controls the data

381
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,360
ideally it's the data principal the

382
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,079
owner of this data

383
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,199
and he or she must control access to

384
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,160
this data

385
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,639
and is you know do you have the access

386
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,360
to the data when you need it

387
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,920
for example you know you want to

388
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
actually

389
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,959
permit somebody else to use it so let's

390
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,000
look at

391
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,638
um healthcare records itself right you

392
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,880
go from one hospital to another hospital

393
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,360
are you able to take the data with you

394
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,759
or it stays with the first hospital

395
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,560
which is typically the case today right

396
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,240
when you go to the second hospital

397
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,000
you have to take a printout and take it

398
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,519
to the second hospital data doesn't

399
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,040
automatically travel

400
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,279
with you these are some of the

401
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,839
challenges that needs to be addressed

402
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:58,880
when it comes to data

403
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,959
very quickly you know i will just touch

404
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,680
upon this i won't go into

405
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,480
details about this because i want to get

406
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,000
to

407
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,799
um you know ai and talk about a also

408
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,039
but you know when it comes to cyber

409
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,039
security the data

410
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,400
uh you know the people you know the

411
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,319
example that they gave you

412
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,799
about twitter was about

413
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,119
using the people to get access right

414
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,439
abusive authorization using social

415
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,360
engineering to get

416
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,400
your user id password etc a man in the

417
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,639
middle who

418
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:40,080
actually kind of

419
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,080
captures uh you know he captures your

420
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,520
data also it's not the person that you

421
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,199
want to actually

422
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,360
connect with etcetera the infra

423
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,240
infrastructure is a vulnerability

424
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,879
the applications themselves are

425
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,880
vulnerable

426
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,760
so let me now go to ai

427
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,880
and cyber security now

428
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,360
see tools are what enable

429
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
us to

430
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
increase our productivity and become

431
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,200
better now ai is not a new

432
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,960
tool it's been in use from the 1960s

433
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,840
but what has happened is the new

434
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
area of ai which is machine learning and

435
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,039
and the

436
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,000
newer one is deep learning uh which is

437
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,879
using

438
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,120
brain like capabilities the brain like

439
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,600
structures of neural networks and things

440
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,719
like that multi-layered neural networks

441
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,439
to access vast amount of data and the

442
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,039
difference between uh the traditional

443
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,320
mode of programming

444
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,080
and ai is actually very very interesting

445
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,280
and that's why i believe this is very

446
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
fundamental

447
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,240
and it's as disruptive as introduction

448
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,840
of digital computers actually see the

449
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,880
traditional programming

450
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,760
what we do is we feed data

451
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,960
we write out the algorithm convert that

452
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,160
into a program

453
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,000
and using this program and the data you

454
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,039
get the results the computer produces

455
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,600
the result

456
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,559
when it comes to aiml what happens is

457
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,760
that

458
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,879
you have label data tagged data

459
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,559
curated data and and

460
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,840
and then you also feed the

461
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,840
desired results and the system

462
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,879
actually comes out with the algorithm or

463
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,678
the program

464
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160
now this is very different paradigm than

465
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,840
the

466
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,799
traditional paradigm of programming

467
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,360
because

468
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,960
you do not know you don't need to know

469
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,280
how to solve the problem

470
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,320
because the computer figures out how to

471
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,639
solve the problem

472
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,080
you feed the sample data and you feed

473
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,160
the desired results

474
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,360
and the computer comes back with the

475
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,080
algorithm so

476
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,479
if if you need to program a computer

477
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,120
about

478
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,039
face recognition clearly that you know

479
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,080
you can't do that because we obviously

480
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,200
do not know

481
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
how we recognize faces etc but by

482
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,039
feeding

483
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,439
let's say human faces that's a few faces

484
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,440
of

485
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,559
men uh the the as they decide results

486
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,679
and then

487
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,039
feeding all kinds of um sample data with

488
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,679
men's faces in different

489
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,679
angles from different um ethnicity and

490
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,880
things like that the computer learns how

491
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,919
to recognize

492
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,039
you know faces of men next you feed

493
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,400
actually some um you know the actual

494
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,200
data

495
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,200
then using this algorithm the computer

496
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,679
is able to recognize faces and today the

497
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,600
computers are as good as human beings

498
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,720
uh the the results are 97 98 percent

499
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,199
accurate actually so pattern recognition

500
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,320
image recognition speech recognition

501
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,520
translation

502
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,080
these are classes of pro problems now

503
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,280
which the computers can be so used to

504
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,639
solve actually

505
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,840
and you know

506
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,720
before process automation uh for

507
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,799
surveillance for enforcing traffic class

508
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,159
because uh you can actually

509
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,280
uh recognize um

510
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,840
people who are uh

511
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,678
who are violating the traffic rules you

512
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,760
know

513
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,440
the self-driving vehicles medical

514
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,600
diagnosis for example

515
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,480
recognition of x-ray images and things

516
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,158
like that and

517
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,280
widely used actually in medical

518
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:35,360
diagnostics etc so these are new

519
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,360
problems that are now used to

520
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,200
solve using this aiml systems etc

521
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:49,200
now the same set of

522
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,400
systems can actually be used to

523
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,640
solve new types of problems etc

524
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,679
and in the future i strongly believe

525
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,559
that

526
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,880
i strongly believe that we are able to

527
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,158
think about artificial general

528
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,640
intelligence that means

529
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,360
computers which are as good as human

530
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,280
beings

531
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,039
and this may not be just one machine it

532
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,600
could be a network of machines

533
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,360
and that's how i believe it will happen

534
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,959
because when we

535
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,000
try to emulate nature when you try to

536
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,280
copy something you don't copy make exact

537
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,200
replicas actually we

538
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,799
actually create new designs and models

539
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,720
for example if you want to travel from

540
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,679
places to place b

541
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,240
we walk we run with our legs and things

542
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,400
like that

543
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,400
but when you think about or if you look

544
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,760
at birds they fly using

545
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,480
mobile wings right flaps they flap their

546
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,879
wings

547
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,520
but when human beings copied this they

548
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,960
created

549
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,639
aircraft which have fixed wings or

550
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,240
you know jet propulsion and things like

551
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,559
that so we

552
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,559
copy nature very differently but we do

553
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,360
it much better because today

554
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,879
you can actually go from place a to

555
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,918
place b at the speed of uh

556
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,520
sound but carrying 600 plus people right

557
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,559
so we do much better than

558
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,760
nature when we copy nature now the

559
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,080
challenge with aiml and and

560
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,600
and this is again a vulnerability when

561
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,399
it comes to

562
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,280
solving uh cyber security related issues

563
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,000
because

564
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,000
uh it's a black box so we do not know

565
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,120
how the system will solve the problem

566
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,520
and what uh it what algorithm

567
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,439
if you get the algorithm but how does it

568
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,360
get that algorithm how it solves it's

569
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,760
not very clear

570
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,240
verifiability is a challenge because

571
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,559
there is no traceability uh

572
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,240
the the algorithm is as good as the

573
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,000
sample data that you fed it

574
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,440
the labels that you've used the tags

575
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,840
that you've used

576
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,799
if there are biases in the data clearly

577
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,120
those biases

578
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,000
are also represented so in the facial

579
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,600
recognition

580
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,640
example if you have not used let's say

581
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,279
uh you know white anglo-saxon male

582
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,279
uh it will not recognize why anglo-saxon

583
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,799
male properly you'll only recognize

584
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,120
indian faces

585
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,480
and similarly the qualifications of

586
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,678
people who are developing

587
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,400
these models also matter when it comes

588
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,760
to

589
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,240
this thing so uh how are we using

590
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,400
ai and machine learning when it comes to

591
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,760
cyber security and things like that

592
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:26,559
we are using um

593
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:29,039
cybersec ai because the the traditional

594
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,840
paradigm is using previous knowledge of

595
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,440
attacks

596
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,039
we create algorithms now we can actually

597
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,279
identify attacks as deviations from

598
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,200
normality

599
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
that means you know the deviations from

600
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,559
what is normal

601
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,880
can actually be used to detect

602
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,799
cyber security attacks and here again

603
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,400
there are two modes that you can use one

604
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,240
is defensive

605
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,640
uh ai and second is offensive

606
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,640
so in the defensive ai we look at

607
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,879
way using a ml engine to look at malware

608
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,799
detection look at spam

609
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,880
look at vulnerability management

610
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,039
to to you know identify vulnerabilities

611
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,600
based on people's behavior or the tools

612
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,600
they use

613
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,879
etc uh data classification

614
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,760
and lastly threat intelligence again uh

615
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,039
looking at

616
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,240
behavior and things like that

617
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:35,520
in the case of offensive ai

618
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,080
and offense in many cases is

619
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,320
the the best defense actually especially

620
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,439
when it comes to

621
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,879
you know cyber attacks uh you know cyber

622
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,679
war and things like that you can

623
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,200
actually use

624
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,000
ai to replicate and create malware

625
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,520
and attack the other party uh when they

626
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,640
come to attack you

627
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,000
using smart botnets

628
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,720
you can use fishing programs and things

629
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,159
like that so

630
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,159
capture their

631
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:12,320
programs etc and this

632
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,720
is the new area in which

633
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,000
the whole area of cyber security is

634
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,480
actually

635
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,480
moving to i'm going to

636
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,120
stop here but the significant activity

637
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,080
in this area if i look at um you know

638
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,360
the number of

639
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,439
companies that are emerging and getting

640
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,120
funded you know this is just a sample

641
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,080
list of categories of startups that are

642
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,879
coming up

643
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,080
in anti-fraud and identity management

644
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,559
mobile security

645
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,960
predictive intelligence behavioral

646
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,000
analytics and anomaly detection

647
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,400
app security iot security deception

648
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,640
security in a very new areas actually a

649
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,840
multi-billion dollars of funding

650
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,360
is going into funding startups in these

651
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,240
areas actually

652
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,158
so uh what i wanted to share with you is

653
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,440
two perspectives one

654
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,000
from a perspective of data and we need

655
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,120
to

656
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,600
create regulations in india

657
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,959
so that we can protect ourselves we can

658
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,080
create regulations

659
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:23,360
on the use of data or misuse of data

660
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,918
we need to specify the ownership of data

661
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,918
and all this requires regulations all

662
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,919
this requires capability building

663
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,679
and the second aspect i want to share

664
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,799
with you was the new tool

665
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,919
of ai machine learning where we can

666
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:42,720
leverage the power of the computer

667
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:46,799
to to solve the problem or to

668
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,880
fight misuse fight

669
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,120
hacking etc and here again we need to

670
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,399
uh have the technology we need to have

671
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,399
the capability

672
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,639
and we need to have the tools in order

673
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,039
to do that and i strongly

674
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,520
believe that this is something that we

675
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,559
need to actually build capabilities

676
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,520
build companies

677
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,360
in india so thank you very much for

678
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,559
giving me this opportunity

679
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:16,080
i do not know whether we have time

680
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,639
for questions if we have i can take

681
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,360
questions otherwise thank you all very

682
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,360
much and

683
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:31,840
wish you all the very best for rest of

684
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:31,840
this conference thank you

685
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,439
you
