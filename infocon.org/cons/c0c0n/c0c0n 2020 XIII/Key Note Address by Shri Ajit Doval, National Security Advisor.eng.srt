8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,160
security my profound gratitude to the

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,080

and organizing committee of the forum

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,238
it is unique platform where technical

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,800
experts

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:39,040

first perspectives in the field of

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,039
hacking

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,440
and information security

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
it is also a noteworth example worth

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,399
emulating

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,399
where imminent persons from different

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,280
persuasions sit together

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,239
to evolve new approaches to find common

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,439
solutions

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,280
to complex multidisciplinary problems i

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,439
must particularly complement

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,439
the government of kerala and kerala

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,639
police for their initiative

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,758
and effort more of such cooperation

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,560
will be needed in other areas of our

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
national life as country can really

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,119
afford

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,119
to be working and tight

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,600
ladies and gentlemen the world is

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
passing through a traumatizing

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,158
experience of kovitch

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,360
19 besides its medical

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,640
and health dimensions that

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,000
presents formidable challenges it will

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,119
profoundly impact

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,880
our economy mode and system of

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,479
governance

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,679
management of our industry and business

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:59,039
education international landscape

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,119
and information technology we all have

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,079
we all have to brace ourselves

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,079
to cope with the emerging realities the

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,560
realities as they exist

51
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,560
and not what we wish them to be

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,360
let me first talk about the change in

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,160
the

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
work environment that has been brought

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,079
about by the pentameter

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,599
work from hope is becoming a new normal

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,720
as dependence on virtual platforms

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,679
has risen steeply there is a greater

59
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,160
dependence

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
on digital payment platforms due to

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,720
reduced

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,680
cash handling greater data sharing

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,879
is happening online and presence on

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,319
social media

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,599
has also increased in india

66
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,640
the progress we made through digital and

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,679
e-governance helped us to ensure

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,399
that we could carry out business of the

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
government

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,840
economic activity and social

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,238
interactions

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,040
however while we were able to manage our

73
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,680
affairs

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,040
to a certain extent the malicious sector

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,280
has also found

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,319
it found in it a new opportunity

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,440
we have witnessed an increase of 500 in

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,399
cyber crimes

79
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,280
due to limited awareness and poor cyber

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
hygiene

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,959
financial frauds have seen an

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,200
exponential increase

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,720
due to greater dependence on digital

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,359
payment platforms

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,359

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959

for our adversaries the huge cyber data

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,080
floating in the cyberspace

96
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,959
is a gold mine for extracting

97
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
information

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,159

citizens

100
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,798
has also added to the vulnerability of

of the of the data concerning our

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,839
critical infrastructure it can also

106
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,320
undermine

107
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,758
our economic and business practices by

108
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,400
employing

114
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720

117
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,320
were registered in a short span of time

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,919
we witnessed attacks on the accounts of

119
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,120
indian government officials

120
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,919

critical infrastructures

126
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,800
just to give some examples a number of

number of initiatives

137
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,039

and guidelines cyber threat intelligence

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,280
is being synergized

proactively and protective measures

142
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,400

being

148
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,680
organized to create a broad spectrum

awareness

150
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,919
that will help counter these new age

administration

156
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,120
at all level was also a challenge

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,039
it needed out of the box solution in

158
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,880
terms of new architecture

159
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,360

solutions

162
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,520
for example lack of collaborative

163
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,240

164
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,599

platforms etc

166
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,840
has adversely affected our self-reliance

167
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,680
and overall security posture due to

168
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,840
lockdown

169
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
audit and risk assessments could not be

170
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,080
conducted

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,080
at a requisite scale thus reducing the

172
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,318
protection posture of critical

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,800
information infrastructure

officers

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,919
are exacerbating the situation

177
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,719
with absence of cyber security

178
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,159
