under the new normal let's return this

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,920
to this question in a moment

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,000
as all of you are aware even prior to

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
the start of the pandemic

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,880
cyber crime and cyber security threats

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320

in our digital world along with the

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,400
rapid growth of the pandemic

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,200
we have all seen massive surges in

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,800
pandemic related cybercrime threats

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,760
against organizations and individuals

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,599
such as surges in online shopping scams

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,599
online dating scams

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,599
covet related phishing malware etc

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,200
and you will hear further today from our

60
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,079
subject matter experts

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,200

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
cyber crime

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,560
and cybersecurity threats

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,518
while countries are racing against the

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,120
clock to develop vaccines to protect us

66
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,560
from the covet 19 virus there is no

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,440
cybercrime vaccine

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,680
or magic pill for the criminal justice

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,879
agencies and information security

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
professionals

71
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,640
to curb the spread of the cybercrime

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,440
pandemic

73
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,159
but there is indeed a best medicine for

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
policy

75
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,319
and decision makers to prescribe to the

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,000
organizations to manage cyber crime and

77
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,599
cyber security

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,680
as we move along to the new normal

79
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,799
the medicine is called three c's

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,200
collaboration cooperation

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,400
and coordination and these three seats

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:34,079
could get us much closer to success

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,080
in managing cybercrime and security

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,159
we have seen the unprecedented calls

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,640
from governments

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,200
around the world to escalate the level

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,040
of international collaboration

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,238
and private public partnerships for

89
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,679
vaccine research and development

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,799
similarly executives in criminal justice

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,319
agencies

92
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,640
are looking to reach across

93
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,518
jurisdictions at the local

94
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,559
and international levels to look for new

95
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,760
perspectives

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,200
and best practices for coordination to

97
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,840
manage cybercrime

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,399
under the new normal and to exchange

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
views

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,760
on managing new cybercrime trends or

101
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,199
adapting to new processes

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,599
up for investigations such as realizing

103
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,639
some

104
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,400
witnesses and victims are not able to

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,400
be interviewed as they are

106
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,080
covet-stricken by the time

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,120
investigators wish to talk to them

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,159
law enforcement agencies are also

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,240
exploring more efficient strategies

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,240
that can enhance cooperation between

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
private and public sectors

112
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
in understanding state-of-the-art

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,199
technologies which could support

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,560
their efforts in cyber crime management

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,720
during these difficult times

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
cooperation between private and public

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,600
sectors

118
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,000
is also essential in the urgent need for

119
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
public

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,520
education during the search and pandemic

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,120
related

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,758
cybercrime as countries are preparing

123
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
for the

124
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,919
second and third waves of the pandemic

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,320
we're sure to see that this is very much

126
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,799
needed

127
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,840
this is yet another reason for pulsate

128
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,240
to continue our partnership with cocon

129
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,280
as we also bring the success of the

130
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,160

137
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,280
has also been apparent through pulseps

138
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,638
partnerships

139
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,198
with the kerala police and isra

then however we shall not

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,440
only remember what we have missed but

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,840
