1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,240
- Hey, I'm Cory Doctorow

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,500
and I work with the Electronic
Frontier Foundation.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,290
I'm a special advisor there.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,610
And this talk it's based on a paper

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,150
that I co-wrote with my colleague
at EFF, Bennett Cyphers,

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,050
that is his real name.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,810
And that paper is also called
"Privacy Without Monopoly"

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,817
same title as this talk,

9
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:24,660
you can download it at eff.org/dc29,

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,123
that's down there in the URL, DEFCON29.

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,790
Now look, anytime someone
talks about big tech

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,940
and the Internet's monopolization,

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,520
someone will bring up the
term, network effects.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,700
Now, network effects
are what economists call

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,740
product or service that gets better,

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,510
the more people there who are using it

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,430
and tech companies do in fact,

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,100
enjoy network effects.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,770
The fact that the people you
wanna talk to are on Facebook

20
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,430
is a reason for you to join Facebook.

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,130
And once you join Facebook,

22
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,860
that's reason for people
who wanna talk to you

23
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,810
to join Facebook

24
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,750
or every time so it makes an iPhone app.

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,560
That makes the iPhone itself

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,040
a more valuable thing to have

27
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,500
'cause there's more apps for it.

28
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,530
And every time someone goes
out and buys an iPhone,

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,790
'cause there's more apps for it,

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,060
that's a reason to make more apps

31
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,690
because there's more
customers for those apps.

32
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,630
But network effects,

33
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,740
they're only half of the story.

34
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,380
Network effects are why companies get big,

35
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,040
but they're not why companies stay big.

36
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,550
Network effects give critical mass

37
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:22,500
to big companies, right?

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,900
So once they get to a certain size,

39
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,540
they just keep growing because
they have so many users

40
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,130
that people keep joining them

41
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,220
because they want the benefits
of those network effects

42
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,860
and they keep adding users.

43
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,540
But if you wanna understand
why these companies stay big,

44
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,220
why users don't leave,

45
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,440
you have to look at switching costs.

46
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,750
That's another term from economics jargon,

47
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,020
switching costs or whatever
you have to give up

48
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,420
to leave a product or a service.

49
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,030
Like if you quit Facebook,

50
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,510
you leave behind the
friends and family members

51
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,940
and the communities and the customers

52
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,430
that you found there, right?

53
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,580
Or that you joined there to be with.

54
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,120
If you leave behind
Google, you'll lose search.

55
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,700
Sure, but you lose your apps

56
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,820
and maybe you lose your mobile platform.

57
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,500
And if you wanna quit iOS,

58
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,711
you have to say goodbye to the apps

59
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:05,544
and the proprietary files

60
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:09,160
that those apps created
that you bought for iOS.

61
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,570
Now, these switching
costs, aren't an accident,

62
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,760
they don't come naturally,

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,540
they're actually
engineered into the system.

64
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,760
After all, you can switch mobile carriers

65
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,580
without losing contact with your friends.

66
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,410
You don't even have to
change your phone number.

67
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,860
You don't have to tell them you've changed

68
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,810
from like Verizon to Sprint.

69
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,330
There's no technical reason.

70
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,110
Facebook couldn't be designed to let you

71
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,040
keep talking to your Facebook friends

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,150
even after you leave Facebook.

73
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,750
After all Facebook has
spent millions of dollars

74
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,700
and they've conducted endless research

75
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,670
to figure out how to let
you stay with your friends

76
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,750
when you join Facebook,

77
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,490
think of all that
technical expertise in UX

78
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,300
that goes into conning you into
uploading your address book

79
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,370
to Facebook so that once you get there,

80
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,790
they can automatically hook you up

81
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,030
with all the friends
who are already there.

82
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,980
And when new friends joined,

83
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,930
they can figure out that they know you.

84
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,250
But not only has Facebook
failed to produce tools

85
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,650
to help you stay in touch
with your Facebook friends

86
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,210
when you leave Facebook,

87
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,300
they've actually devoted
substantial engineering

88
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,490
to make it harder for you to
maintain your relationships

89
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,790
if you have the temerity to
stop using their service.

90
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,300
In other words, Facebook,

91
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,130
just like every tech monopolist
does everything it can

92
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,080
to raise the switching costs for users

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,053
who leave for a rival service.

94
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,320
Now, why did tech companies
want high switching costs?

95
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,450
Companies need to balance their
interests and your interests

96
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,010
as their customer or user.

97
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,100
Now, sometimes customers and companies,

98
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,180
they have the same interest,

99
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,150
like if you make an app and
I buy that app from you,

100
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,760
neither of us wants that app to crash,

101
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,270
we want it to be good,

102
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,050
but sometimes those interests diverge

103
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,240
and when they diverge,

104
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,750
when what's best for the customers

105
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,430
and what's best for the company,

106
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,240
the company wants to resolve
those issues in their favor.

107
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,460
But when a company doesn't

108
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,067
that were downs to their
benefit and your cost say like,

109
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,087
"Gouging you on the price or sucking up

110
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:02,690
"a bunch of your personal
identifying information,"

111
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,640
they run the risk that you'll be so upset

112
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,800
that you will quit the service.

113
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
And so that's where
switching costs come in.

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
The higher a switching cost is

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,870
the more company gets to abuse you

116
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,470
before they lose you as a customer.

117
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,040
That is, if the cost of
preserving your privacy

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,810
is less than the cost of losing touch

119
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,180
with your Facebook friends,

120
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,330
the communities and the
customers that you have there,

121
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,800
then Facebook gets to abuse your privacy

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,610
and they don't have to worry
about losing you as a customer.

123
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,070
The more you stand to lose

124
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,880
by quitting our product or a service,

125
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,860
the more value the company
behind that product or service

126
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,140
can shift from your side
of the balance sheet

127
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,910
to their side of the balance sheet

128
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,423
without losing your business.

129
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,030
Now, fortunately for our
Internet Connected World,

130
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,210
general purpose computers

131
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,170
connected to general purpose networks,

132
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,860
they eat switching costs for breakfast.

133
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,020
All the stuff that we
talk about at this con,

134
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,710
reverse engineering,
scraping and capsulation,

135
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,860
compatibility layers, quirks
modes, virtualization,

136
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,680
they all boil down to the same thing.

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,770
There are ways to connect something new

138
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,580
to something that already exists.

139
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,343
In other words, they're
tools for interoperability.

140
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:13,490
interop is a profound and
crucial part of the design

141
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,070
of a network to technological society.

142
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,550
All other things being
equal interop puts a limit

143
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,700
on how badly a company gets
to abuse its customers.

144
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,360
So think for a minute about how Apple

145
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,920
managed to kick Microsoft's at
the start of this millennium.

146
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,240
The office programs that
Microsoft made for the Mac

147
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
were really terrible,

148
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,840
so much so that workplaces
transitioned everyone,

149
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,680
even their graphic designers to windows,

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,530
because that was the only way
they could share documents

151
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,210
with the rest of the team.

152
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,510
Every Microsoft office
document that anyone created

153
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,610
using windows made windows more valuable.

154
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,980
That's what we call the network effect,

155
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,720
but not using windows
meant that you were cut off

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,820
from every Microsoft office user

157
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,950
and that is the switching cost.

158
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,260
Apple undid the network effect

159
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,240
by annihilating the switching cost.

160
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,380
The way they did that
was by making a program

161
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,920
called the iWork suite,

162
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,480
which decomposed into
three smaller programs

163
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,010
called pages, numbers, and keynote

164
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,640
that they made by reverse engineering,

165
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,010
the Microsoft file formats

166
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,380
and making interoperable products.

167
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,240
After that, the switching
costs fell to basically zero.

168
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,830
Network effects are how companies get big,

169
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,990
but high switching costs
are why they stay big.

170
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,950
And that's why companies
do everything they can

171
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,060
to raise switching costs.

172
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,503
They use a lot of
technological countermeasures,

173
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:33,611
that kind of stuff we talk about here,

174
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:35,730
DRM, obfuscation, tamper resistance,

175
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,720
boot lockers, all kinds of stuff,

176
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,240
but they also use legal countermeasures.

177
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,950
And those are a little more insidious,

178
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,310
it's the kind of thing EFF
spends a lot of time on,

179
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,810
laws like section 1201

180
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,760
of the digital millennium copyright act

181
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,850
that bands bypassing DRM

182
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,690
even if you're not
doing anything nefarious

183
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,440
or the computer fraud and abuse act,

184
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,040
this Ronald Reagan era cybersecurity law

185
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,210
that has been stretched to cover

186
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,810
all kinds of legitimate activity,

187
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,460
especially the kind of thing
that security researchers do

188
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,190
as well as things like software patents

189
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,930
and weird and obscure legal theories

190
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,463
like tortious interference
with contract and more.

191
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,760
All of those countermeasures,

192
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,650
the technological ones and the legal ones,

193
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,150
that's how big tech stays big.

194
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,050
And the higher the switching costs,

195
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,950
the more big tech gets to abuse us

196
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,850
because the higher the switching costs

197
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:24,130
the worst that abuse has to be before,

198
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,400
it makes sense to switch.

199
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,270
And that brings me to privacy.

200
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,810
Remember the talk is called
"Privacy Without Monopoly."

201
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,780
Companies don't invade your
privacy because they're nosy,

202
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,560
they spying you because spying on you

203
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,250
makes them more profitable.

204
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,410
Google and Facebook,
they invade your privacy

205
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,390
because it makes their ad
targeting service more valuable.

206
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,450
It's not why Apple does it,

207
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,340
Apple invades Chinese user's privacy

208
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,640
like by backdooring its cloud service

209
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,050
and blocking working VPNs from
the iOS app store in China.

210
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,610
They do that to preserve its
access to Chinese customers

211
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,713
and far more importantly,
Chinese manufacturing.

212
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,470
Interoperability lowers switching costs,

213
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,120
and that makes it easier to switch away

214
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,680
from a company whose
products invade your privacy.

215
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,420
And that means that
companies are less likely

216
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,240
to wanna invade your
privacy in the first place,

217
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,480
because they understand that if they do,

218
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,010
they might lose you, you
might lose your business.

219
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,530
But if they go ahead and do
it anyway, you get to switch.

220
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,681
And that is something that
lawmakers have figured out.

221
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:24,530
We have seen legal
interoperability mandates,

222
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,290
these are laws or regulations
that require companies

223
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,600
to inter-operate with
smaller new market entrance

224
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,890
proposed in the United Kingdom,
the U.S, the European union,

225
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,850
and elsewhere all over the world.

226
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,480
And these bills and regulations,

227
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,480
they propose one or more of
three kinds of interoperability.

228
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,540
The first kind is one

229
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,530
that you're really
familiar with, I'm sure,

230
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,850
data portability.

231
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,740
That's when a company has to produce

232
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,530
a standards defined blob of your data,

233
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,850
a snapshot that you can
either use for your own,

234
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,470
or maybe upload to arrivals
so that you can start there

235
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,160
with everything configured
the way you like it

236
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,370
and your social graph intact.

237
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,410
The second kind is a little more exotic,

238
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,010
it's called back-end interoperability,

239
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,920
that's when a company is
required by law to expose an API

240
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,470
so that third parties can
use it to exchange platforms

241
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,410
with data with dominant platforms.

242
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,410
And the third kind is
called delegate ability,

243
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,610
that's interoperability for the front end.

244
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,280
So it would be a
requirement that companies

245
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,220
have some kind of standardized way

246
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,310
to script their user interfaces

247
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,070
so that you as a user
might nominate someone else

248
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,370
to autopilot parts of the
service on your behalf,

249
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,880
maybe to moderate content,

250
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,910
or like, imagine if you wanted to finally

251
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,930
turn on location privacy in Google,

252
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,170
this is something that's
notoriously hard to do.

253
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,930
Google engineers who
work on location privacy,

254
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,400
can't figure out where
all the check boxes are

255
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,770
that you have to tick off

256
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,550
in order to have good
location privacy with Google

257
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,110
and if you miss just
one, you got no privacy.

258
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,570
So maybe Privacy International

259
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,670
would just throw some resources at that,

260
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,830
figure out what the recipe was
for getting you good privacy

261
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,310
for your location on Google

262
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,520
and then you could delegate the ability

263
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,740
to navigate all of Google's nefarious

264
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,280
and Baroque settings
pages on your behalf to PI

265
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,113
and they'd go ahead

266
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:14,694
and they would give
you a location privacy.

267
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:15,660
(clears throat)

268
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,430
Now, not withstanding that last example,

269
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,320
interop complicated
relationship to privacy.

270
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,790
On the one hand interop
promises to allow users

271
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,370
to reclaim their privacy,

272
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,390
by switching from high
surveillance services

273
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,990
to privacy respecting rivals

274
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,350
whether those are like
co-ops or non-profits

275
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,280
or public services or startups,

276
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,920
and they'd get to do
so without sacrificing

277
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,500
their relationships and the benefits

278
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,400
that they used to get from interacting

279
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,540
with those big dominant services.

280
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,750
And interoptherefore puts pressure

281
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,440
on the dominant services
to be better on privacy,

282
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,930
because the low switching
costs mean that the choices

283
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,470
that put shareholders' interests

284
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,610
ahead of user's interests will
result in the immediate loss

285
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,023
of users and revenue.

286
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,410
But on the other hand,

287
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,323
interoperability could
be a privacy nightmare.

288
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,280
And like, what if a
privacy abusing company,

289
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,540
a company that's even
worse on privacy than say,

290
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,020
Google or Facebook wants to
plug into one of those services,

291
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,860
after all Google and Facebook,

292
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,530
yeah, they invade the
hell out of your privacy,

293
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,980
but they're playing an iterated game,

294
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,520
they're not gonna be so bad

295
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,910
that you leave the service straight away,

296
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,190
they're trying to keep that in balance.

297
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,300
But what if it's a new company

298
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,320
that doesn't care about
keeping your business,

299
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,670
they just wanna steal your data?

300
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,940
Earlier this summer at the
House Judiciary Committee

301
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,910
held markup hearings
on six antitrust bills,

302
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,080
including the access act,

303
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,000
which is one of these
interoperability mandates,

304
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,270
it's a law that would force big companies

305
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,070
to expose their APIs to rivals.

306
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,380
And some of the lawmakers there,

307
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,540
they asked a good question.

308
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,373
They said like,

309
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:44,540
"What if I'm Chinese
state-owned enterprise

310
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,587
use one of these APIs

311
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:48,400
and just sucked up a
bunch of sensitive data?

312
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,810
Or what if it was just a company,

313
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,260
a company like Cambridge Analytica
that could get an API key

314
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,130
and use the API to just
harvest all kinds of data

315
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,840
under false pretenses?

316
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,570
Now, those are really excellent questions.

317
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,620
Unfortunately,

318
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,330
the answers that tech
companies give to them

319
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,713
are really stupid.

320
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,850
Companies like Facebook
and Google and Apple,

321
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,720
they say that they have already attained

322
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,960
the optimum level of interoperability,

323
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,710
just the right trade
off between user privacy

324
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,050
and user freedom.

325
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,110
And they save that they
know that they've done this

326
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,560
because they have the same
interests as their users

327
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
and the best way to make sure

328
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,980
that no one nefarious ever
gets to plug into their system

329
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,600
is to give them free reign
to block interoperability

330
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,270
whenever they think it
makes sense to do so.

331
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,830
Now, whenever the Fox starts telling us

332
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,580
about how good it is at
guarding our henhouse,

333
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,840
we should be suspicious.

334
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,180
So like when Facebook tells
us that we can trust it,

335
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,726
not to let Cambridge Analytica
plug into its service

336
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:45,790
and get all of our data,

337
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,040
we should be pretty
skeptical of that claim

338
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,035
because Facebook already did
let Cambridge Analytica plug

339
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:53,143
into its service and get all of our data.

340
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,430
Every platform,

341
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,610
from Google to Apple, to
LinkedIn, to Microsoft.

342
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,270
And yeah, I know that's the same company.

343
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,560
One of the things that's
happened over the last 40 years

344
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,380
as we've allowed companies to monopolize

345
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,190
is that the web has turned
into like five giant websites,

346
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,640
so it was screenshots of
text from the other four.

347
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,540
And all of those big companies

348
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,880
have either intentionally allowed

349
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,950
someone to suck up all
of our private data,

350
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,090
because it redounded to their profit

351
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,840
or they screwed up their security so badly

352
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,890
that someone was able to do
it without their permission.

353
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,510
Monopolous can't be trusted

354
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,520
to decide who gets to compete with them

355
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,573
and how, and when, obviously.

356
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,050
But of course does come
with serious privacy risks,

357
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,810
and proposals to fix interop
should address this risk.

358
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,690
And they do,

359
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,030
but in an ideal world, the
way we fixed most of this risk

360
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,590
is by America adopting a
strong federal privacy law,

361
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,870
a law that specified when
consent needed to be obtained

362
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,280
and in order to gain
access to your information

363
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,140
and to process it.

364
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,060
And that would describe
what consent was, right?

365
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,580
Consent can't just be,

366
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,400
I've shown you a dialogue box
with 30,000 words of like,

367
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,070
garbage legalees that no
one is ever gonna read

368
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,680
and I agree button underneath it.

369
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,650
A law like that would
clarify some hard problems,

370
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,230
like do you need your friend's permission

371
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,800
to export the private
messages that they sent you

372
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,820
when you quit one service
and go to another one.

373
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,090
Now, there is a version of
this in the European union.

374
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,680
There's the GDPR, the General
Data Protection Regulation,

375
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,250
GDPR, it's a mixed bag,

376
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,810
it sometimes gets a bad rap,
but even with all of its flaws,

377
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,340
it is still a democratically
arrived upon set of rules

378
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,920
for data processing.

379
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,340
And if those rules have flaws,

380
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,050
there's a democratic
process for amending them.

381
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,240
And that's a lot better than
how no privacy laws at all

382
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,720
the way America does,

383
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,730
and it's also a lot better than having

384
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,140
whatever privacy rules we have,

385
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,900
unilaterally set behind closed

386
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,610
in corporate monopolous
boardrooms with no recourse.

387
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,520
Now, a good federal privacy law

388
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,330
shouldn't just spell out the
rules for obtaining consent.

389
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,720
It should also have a
private right of action.

390
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,250
That's a lawyer's term
for when you get to sue

391
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,510
to defend your rights,

392
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,860
instead of having to get
the federal trade commission

393
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,220
or your local district attorney,
or the attorney general,

394
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,910
or some other authority
to take up your cause

395
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,330
and spend their blood and treasure

396
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,973
to make sure you get justice.

397
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,350
With a federal privacy law

398
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,960
that had a private right of action,

399
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,720
a lot of the thorniest
problems with interop,

400
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,800
they just go away,

401
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,730
like whether you get to take
your friend's annotations

402
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,750
on your photos with you

403
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,840
when you export those photos
and go to a new service.

404
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,030
Does your address belong to you

405
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,800
because you uploaded it to Facebook

406
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,980
or does it belong to Facebook

407
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,090
because they added new
information to it as you used it?

408
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,768
As well as some really,
really hard questions,

409
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:43,010
like, even if we agree

410
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,860
that you should have to
get your friends consent

411
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,850
to export the messages they
send you to another service,

412
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,040
does that still apply if the
person whose private messages

413
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,410
you are trying to export

414
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,300
or the messages that your stalker

415
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,180
or your harasser sent to you,

416
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,280
that you wanna hang onto

417
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,410
in case you need to get
a restraining order,

418
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,680
do they get to tell you

419
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:03,960
that you're not allowed to
take those messages with you

420
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,870
when you quit a service
that wasn't willing

421
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,300
to use moderation policies

422
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,453
to defend you from that
harasser and go somewhere else?

423
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,530
Now, when governments order
companies to interoperate,

424
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,730
they don't just need to rely
on a Federal Privacy Law,

425
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,170
they can go beyond what the law says,

426
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,100
and if there is no law,

427
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,860
they can create some protections

428
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,820
in interoperability mandates.

429
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,720
So for example,

430
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,470
the first version of the access act,

431
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,700
which was introduced
last year in the Senate,

432
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,170
it said that the FTC should
create a new kind of company,

433
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,170
kind of arms length, special referee,

434
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,320
that would be in charge

435
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,820
of protecting the users of big platforms.

436
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,590
And when someone started a new service

437
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,070
that wanted to plug into, one
of the big platforms, APIs,

438
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,060
they would evaluate that service

439
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,380
and decide whether or not that
service was on the up and up,

440
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,740
they wouldn't be allowed to
compete with that service

441
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,670
or with the big dominant platforms,

442
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,080
they would have to have
no conflicts of interest,

443
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,900
and they would decide whether
or not your new service

444
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,780
would be able to plug into the API.

445
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,890
And if so,

446
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,850
like what a fair rate for
using the API would be

447
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,120
to recover the cost of
operating the servers

448
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,630
that provide you with a data conduit.

449
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,280
Now, the access act got
reintroduced this year in the house,

450
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,117
not the Senate, and it did
away with these third parties,

451
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:18,400
what you might call a fiduciary

452
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,880
and it replaced them with something else

453
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,730
that's also pretty good,

454
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,090
a set of rules for what
kind of company is allowed

455
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,760
to connect to the API,

456
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,880
rules like those companies are not allowed

457
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,033
to collect or monetize
or share user data ever.

458
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,030
Now, interoperability
mandates have their place.

459
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,320
Interoperability mandates
are kinda how we got here.

460
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,660
Like if you're my age,

461
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,560
you'll remember that the golden age

462
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,050
of long distance bulletin board systems

463
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,080
came about as a result of
an interoperability mandate

464
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,913
that forced the phone

465
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:51,840
to allow third party
long distance carriers

466
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,820
to connect to them,

467
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,470
and that's when suddenly
you could connect to BBSs

468
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,880
far from your home without
having to be a phone freak

469
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,010
and risk doing federal time.

470
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,250
But there is another kind of interop

471
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,560
beyond these interop mandates.

472
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,900
And that's the kind of
interop that Apple used

473
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,760
when it reversed engineered
Microsoft offices file formats

474
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,420
and made pages and numbers and keynotes.

475
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,680
It's the kind of interop
that people at this kinda con

476
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,260
should be pretty familiar with,

477
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,740
after all, no one ordered
Microsoft to give Apple

478
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,010
the spec for its file formats
and Apple didn't ask Microsoft

479
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,940
for permission to do so.

480
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,860
Microsoft actually did everything it could

481
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,760
to obfuscate those file formats.

482
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,990
They didn't just not cooperate with Apple,

483
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,580
they actively opposed

484
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,190
anyone reverse engineering
their file formats.

485
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,010
And Apple did it anyway.

486
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,880
That interop is called
adversarial interoperability.

487
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,160
Or we at EFF,

488
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,800
we call it competitive
compatibility or calm, calm.

489
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,210
This is really hard to say
adversarial interoperability.

490
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,160
So when I say ComCom, then
competitive compatibility,

491
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,200
which is also adversary interoperability.

492
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,580
See, you learn something new every day.

493
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,340
So ComCom is in the story
of every tech monopoly

494
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,600
that was knocked over,

495
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,080
and every new tech company
that rose to greatness.

496
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,870
ComCom is that impolite
zero given form of interop

497
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,400
that doesn't care if the
way that I plugged my thing

498
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,743
into your thing, major shareholder said,

499
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:18,687
"ComCom is in this story of
everything from IBM PC clones

500
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:22,647
"to Hayes modem command sets,
to SMB and Samba networking,

501
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:25,117
"to the Browser wars
and the rise of the web,

502
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:27,440
"and of course, online music,"

503
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,690
but there is a new and
impenetrable thicket of laws

504
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,110
and legal interpretations,

505
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,950
cybersecurity laws like the
computer fraud and abuse act,

506
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,200
anti circumvention laws like
section 1201 of the GMCA

507
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,140
software patents and more

508
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,250
that have made this once
routine practice of ComCom

509
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,480
into a legal minefield

510
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,633
that today is almost entirely
practiced in the shadows.

511
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,270
We need lawmakers and
regulators to restore ComCom.

512
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,630
And one way they can do that
is by reforming existing laws

513
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,400
so that they're no longer so broad

514
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,130
that can be used to block interop,

515
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,530
or you could pass a new law,

516
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,077
a kind of inter operators
defense that said,

517
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,617
"Not withstanding all the other laws,

518
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:09,607
"it's not an offense to add features

519
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:13,200
"or modify a product or service
for a legitimate purpose."

520
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,970
It would shield you from liability,

521
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,270
if you were making replacement
parts or fixing something

522
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,270
or improving its security
or adding lawful features

523
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,860
or making it accessible to
people with disabilities.

524
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,580
And there's another way we could do it,

525
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,500
as the FTC pursues Gianopoulos

526
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,100
and enters into settlements with them,

527
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,960
'cause they don't wanna spend
10 or 15 years in court.

528
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,500
One of the conditions of those settlements

529
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,270
could be that the companies agreed

530
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,270
not to use these laws to
shut down into our operators.

531
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,670
They could still use
copyright law to stop people

532
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,670
who were violating their copyright,

533
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,273
but not just people who've bypass to TPM.

534
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,540
Now, mandatory interoperability

535
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,640
and adversarial interoperability,

536
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,750
they're not exclusive,
they're not contradictory,

537
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,650
they are extremely complimentary.

538
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,690
We want mandatory interop
because it's orderly.

539
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,830
If there's a mandated API
for one of the big services,

540
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,420
then the way that you make
something new that plugs into it

541
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,000
is by reading the docs,

542
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,890
looking at the reference
code and building your app.

543
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,700
Now, compare that with the
messy guerrilla warfare

544
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,790
of ComCom,

545
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,210
in order to plug into a service,

546
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,470
you might have to fuzz its
inputs or find a flaw in its IDS

547
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,340
or bypass it's bootloader, and
then every time they patch,

548
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,490
you have to do it all over again.

549
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,430
But ComCom is useful here

550
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,470
because mandatory interop is so brittle.

551
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,880
Companies have a lot of ways

552
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,600
to break their mandatory interop

553
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,200
without violating the letter of the law,

554
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,770
they could pre-touch really shut down

555
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,780
their API over and over again

556
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,330
because of suspicious activity

557
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,050
or they could just restructure
the internal data model

558
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,320
so that the fields that the API can access

559
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,230
are no longer useful to a competitor.

560
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,210
When a company nerfs it's
mandatory API, getting that fixed,

561
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,810
involves a full-blown
regulators investigation.

562
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,170
It involves appeals,
it involves a judgment,

563
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,230
it involves an order and enforcement,

564
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,400
and it could take years during which time

565
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,010
those little services that have popped up

566
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,220
to give users more freedom
might just collapse.

567
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,860
But if ComCom is legally safe,

568
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,046
if you're allowed to do ComCom

569
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:15,420
then the day that
accompany breaks its API,

570
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,360
all those little companies that rely on it

571
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,410
can switch to scraping
or reverse engineering

572
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,744
or other adversarial tactics.

573
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:24,520
In fact, companies are so frightened

574
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,990
of the unquantifiable risk

575
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,270
that's posed by free for all bot wars,

576
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,110
that in many cases,

577
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,030
they're just gonna resist the temptation

578
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,320
to wreck their APIs because
the alternative is worse,

579
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,630
but if they go for it anyway,

580
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,760
if they're reckless enough
to shut down the API

581
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,640
and brave the wrath of the regulator,

582
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,740
well, then ComCom fills in the gaps

583
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,500
while we wait for the FTC to wake up

584
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,670
and smack them around a little.

585
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,990
Let me give you a concrete
example of how that works

586
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,950
and how it fails.

587
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,250
Back in 2012,

588
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,510
Massachusetts passed a ballot initiative

589
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,840
with an overwhelming majority

590
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,820
that forced the big three automakers

591
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,810
to supply independent mechanics

592
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,660
with the data they needed to
read diagnostic information

593
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,070
off the wired network and cars,
what's called the can bus.

594
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,130
Car-makers had spent years
systematically monopolizing

595
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,124
independent car service,

596
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:16,700
and they had been doing so by
obfuscating those diagnostic

597
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,793
and repair messages and
people in Massachusetts

598
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:20,580
had enough of it.

599
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,100
But even before that law came into effect,

600
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,620
car-makers started redesigning their cars

601
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,910
so that all that useful
diagnostic information,

602
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,670
no longer float over the canvas,

603
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,060
it flowed over new wireless meshes.

604
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,980
Those weren't covered by the law.

605
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,900
Now eventually Massachusetts passed a law

606
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,730
that overrode those loopholes,

607
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,170
that forced automakers to expose the data

608
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,090
that was going over
those wireless networks,

609
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,770
but it took eight years.

610
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,160
And during those eight years,

611
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,290
independent mechanics had a choice.

612
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,870
They could either just have
cars that they couldn't fix,

613
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,550
or they could close their
shops and go to work

614
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,670
for one of the big automakers.

615
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,480
The mismatch between the time
it takes to subvert a mandate

616
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,550
and the time it takes to fix it again

617
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,340
is why mandates alone are not enough.

618
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,230
For mandates to work
they need counterweights,

619
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,570
a consequence that befalls
companies that subvert them

620
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,880
that hurts worse than obeying the mandate

621
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,250
in the first place.

622
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,307
And that counterweight that's ComCom.

623
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,800
Imagine, for example, if car-makers

624
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,290
who are breaking their diagnostic mandate

625
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,080
had to worry about ComCom
when they were doing that.

626
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,310
Imagine if when they
switch the service messages

627
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,910
from the wired network to that
exempted wireless network,

628
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,430
a couple of smart MIT kids

629
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,750
could have just entered the market

630
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,860
with a raspberry PI based interpreter

631
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,440
that costs them a dollar to make,

632
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,400
that they could sell to every
mechanic in the state for $20

633
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,820
and that would continue to
read those wireless messages

634
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,730
as they flew around in the car.

635
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,210
Anything the car manufacturers

636
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,850
did to freeze out those gadgets

637
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,100
would mean retooling every
authorized service center

638
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,650
and dealing with the
inevitable upgrade problems.

639
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,570
Meanwhile, independent mechanics
would have a new business

640
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,250
to supply them with diagnostic tools

641
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,090
that MIT kids startup

642
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,590
and that business could
offer other services to them,

643
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,630
services that made the manufacturers

644
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,430
even less important to
independent repair services.

645
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,800
ComCom therefore is the stiffener

646
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,280
that turns these otherwise
structurally unsound mandates

647
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,183
and to sturdy and pro
competitive solutions.

648
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,350
Now, ComCom just like
every other kind of interop

649
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,280
has plenty of ways that it
can be abused for privacy.

650
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,000
Today, companies say
that they stopped ComCom

651
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,440
from abusing our privacy

652
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,600
by using anti circumvention
enforceable terms of service

653
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,500
and other anti-competitive laws

654
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,930
to safeguard their users' privacy.

655
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,550
But if we really wanna
defend user privacy,

656
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,390
we need a privacy law.

657
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,030
We shouldn't be letting companies

658
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,370
improvise this highly selective
privacy defense regime

659
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,640
from random cybersecurity
and copyright laws

660
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,110
had been lying around
since the Reagan era.

661
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,660
With an actual privacy law,

662
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,740
we wouldn't have to rely
on companies to tell us

663
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,410
what the good ComCom
and the bad ComCom was.

664
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,410
We could tell what was
good and what was bad,

665
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,803
good ComCom didn't violate
privacy law and bad ComCom did.

666
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,500
Now, we've just underwent a half century

667
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,290
of official tolerance for monopoly,

668
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,230
but we are at a turning point.

669
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,200
The president's latest executive order

670
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,720
says that America's new policy

671
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,510
is officially anti-monopoly
and sets out 72 directives

672
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,620
to the various administrative agencies

673
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,140
to make that a reality.

674
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,920
There are six antitrust
bills going through Congress.

675
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,470
There is also state
level antitrust action.

676
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,250
There's antitrust action in Canada,

677
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,960
the UK, and the European union

678
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,020
with laws like the digital markets act

679
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,600
and the digital services act.

680
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,650
This is quite a moment that we're having,

681
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,170
but the point of this fight,

682
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,600
isn't just about competition
for its own sake.

683
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,240
I mean, every time a company
Apple does something good,

684
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,880
like introducing anti-fracking technology,

685
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,630
the ad-tech industry starts whining

686
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,770
that this is anti-competitive,
and they're not wrong.

687
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,720
Apple does make it harder to
compete in the race to see

688
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,550
who is best at violating our human rights

689
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,600
most cheaply and prolifically,

690
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,060
but that's not a race we want.

691
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,660
We don't want competition

692
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,070
to find the best human rights violator.

693
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,890
We wanna ban human rights violations,

694
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,150
interoperability, and
privacy rules together,

695
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,910
do more than just enhancing
competition or choice.

696
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,840
They do something more nobler indeed,

697
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,520
they give us technological
self-determination.

698
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,480
The right to decide how
our technology works

699
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,270
either by changing it ourselves

700
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,120
or by finding someone we
trust to change it for us.

701
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,370
So you can stick with a big
company if it's got your back,

702
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,570
but you can switch away if
it doesn't have your back,

703
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,890
because companies do sometimes
have their user's backs.

704
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,690
If a platform knows that the users

705
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,840
aren't cowed by switching costs,

706
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,640
they're incentivized to
treat those users well.

707
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,300
I'm not here to say that companies

708
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,600
will always screw their users.

709
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,820
I mean, I know a lot of
you people watching this,

710
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,030
do good hard work on
behalf of those companies

711
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,500
to defend dumdums like me.

712
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,500
I'm not a hacker, but no
one is ever going to pay you

713
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:06,610
to defend me from your boss,
especially not your boss.

714
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,600
Interoperability and privacy law.

715
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,530
They're how we make it so
that you don't have to.

716
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,230
Now, that's the end of the talk.

717
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,840
And if you want more detail,

718
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,580
I urge you to read the paper once again,

719
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,680
it's called "Privacy Without Monopoly"

720
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,060
and you can read it,

721
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,350
you can see the URL down
there, eff.org/dc29.

722
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,760
I'd like to thank again, my
colleague Bennett Cyphers,

723
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,400
who did all the heavy
lifting on this paper,

724
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I hope you will give the paper a read.

725
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,430
And I'm really looking forward
to seeing you next year

726
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,320
for DEFCON30 in person.

727
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,700
Assuming we haven't all been killed

728
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,420
by the Zeta variant by then.

729
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,470
Please get vaccinated, wear your mask.

730
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,730
We will get through
this fellows and folks,

731
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,840
and gosh, fellows, that was
a terrible way to end a talk

732
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,180
that I managed to pull off

733
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,100
without any gaps all the way through.

734
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,950
We will get through this folks.

735
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,010
Please do what you can
to keep us all healthy

736
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,650
and thank you for the
hard work you're doing

737
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,320
and for your attention.

738
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,950
I really hope you enjoy
the rest of DEFCON.

739
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,950
Thank you very much.
