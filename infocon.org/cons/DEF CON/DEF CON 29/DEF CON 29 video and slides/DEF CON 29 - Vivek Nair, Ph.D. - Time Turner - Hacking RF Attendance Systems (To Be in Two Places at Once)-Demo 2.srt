1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,480
- All right, now for a brief demo.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,320
On my left is the
legitimate polling system.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,590
And as always, if I select
an answer on my remote,

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,250
it'll be broadcast and
received by the base station.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,340
On my right is an Arduino
running the custom firmware

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,990
and initialized to a random serial number.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,720
It's connected to my
laptop right now with a USB

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,030
so I can manually send it commands.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,810
And if I instruct it
to broadcast an answer

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,420
as if it were a remote,

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,790
right now, it'll look to the base station

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,220
as though another student
is submitting an answer

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,900
using their remote.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,640
Now, let's try this again,

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,530
but this time I'm going to set the Arduino

16
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,350
to the same serial number as my remote.

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,930
Now, if I click in with
the remote as normal

18
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,593
and then instruct the Arduino
to broadcast an answer,

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,860
it appears to the base station
as though the same student

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,780
is simply changing their response.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,470
In effect, these two devices

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,373
are acting as if they are the same remote.
