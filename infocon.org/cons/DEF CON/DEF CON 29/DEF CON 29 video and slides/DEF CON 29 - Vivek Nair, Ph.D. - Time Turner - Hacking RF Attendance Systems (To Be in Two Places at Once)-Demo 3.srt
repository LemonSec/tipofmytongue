00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,820
- Okay, same demo as
before, except this time,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,970
my Arduino set up to
emulate a base station.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,950
So when a student submits an answer,

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,630
it's overheard not just by
the legitimate base station,

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,400
but also by the Arduino,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,670
which can then nicely
display all of the students'

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,323
selections on my laptop.
