1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,770
- Well, it turns out that
the authentication problem

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,920
may be even worse than it seems.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,680
That's because in addition
to the student remote

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,930
the same company also
produces an instructor remote

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,800
that allows teachers to
start and stop polling,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,880
show and hide the poll results,

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,420
switch slides on a
PowerPoint presentation,

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,440
and even select the correct quiz answer.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,530
Now, if these devices look similar,

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,500
that's because they're actually
identical under the hood.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,490
So it's as easy to emulate
this instructor remote

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,930
as it was to emulate this student remote.

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,400
And once one can do that,
they can do everything

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,550
from changing the slides on
the instructor's presentation

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,860
to even selecting their own
quiz answers as correct,

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,340
which really emphasizes the need for a PUF

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,063
or some other hardware-based
authentication mechanism.
