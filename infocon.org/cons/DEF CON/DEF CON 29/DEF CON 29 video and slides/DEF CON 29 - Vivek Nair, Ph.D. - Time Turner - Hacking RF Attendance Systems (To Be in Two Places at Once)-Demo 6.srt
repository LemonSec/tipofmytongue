1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,440
- The idea is that with just
a little adhesive putty,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,650
the student can go in the previous night

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,920
and covertly attach this
device to some surface

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
in the lecture hall,

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,010
and he can be sure that the next morning,

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,330
this device will attend class for him

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,110
while he attends the other
class the normal way.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,530
Of course, if he can do this,

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,520
then he could just as
easily build two devices

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,810
and attach them both to
surfaces in the lecture halls.

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,860
And then these will both
attend class for him,

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,400
and he can catch up on
homework or sleep in.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,930
Now, I'm not gonna tell
you if this student

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,690
eventually just built these
for all of his classes,

15
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,833
but I'll let you come to your
own conclusion on that one.
