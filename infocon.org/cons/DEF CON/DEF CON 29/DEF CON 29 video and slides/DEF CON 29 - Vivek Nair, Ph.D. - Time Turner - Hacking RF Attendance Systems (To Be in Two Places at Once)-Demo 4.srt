00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,550
- All right, so now
we're getting somewhere,

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,340
but this is not exactly
a practical solution

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,140
and that's to remain tethered to a PC

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,020
and manually controlled.

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,360
The first step towards a
completely self-contained solution

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,770
is to attach a standalone input device,

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,950
which I've done here
by crudely soldering on

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,550
a 128-by-32 pixel OLED screen
with three input buttons.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,080
The really nice thing about using

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,630
an ultra low power platform like Arduino

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,750
is that this device, even
with a display attached,

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,510
has a peak current draw
of about 20 milliamps

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,070
as you can see here.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,880
So this tiny 500-milliamp
power lithium polymer battery

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,580
should last well over 24
hours on a single charge.

16
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,480
If I connect this up, we now
have something resembling

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,320
a practical self-contained device.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,420
Here's the same device

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,640
just with a little electrical tape added

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,053
to hold everything together.
