1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
(upbeat electronic music)

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,109
- Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,830
of BETWEEN TWO PRINTERS.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,840
My name's Katie, and
today we'll be talking

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,940
with this year's DEF CON
badge makers, MK Factor.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,580
Hello, Michael, thank you for being here.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,130
- Glad to be here.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,860
- To my knowledge, we're filming this

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,410
before the badge is completely done, yes?

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,250
- Yes, about three weeks before DEF CON.

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,550
- All right, so we can't be able

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,090
to answer all of the questions,

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,390
but we're gonna try to do our best.

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,260
So tell us a little bit about MK Factor.

15
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,650
- So MK Factor is our badge team

16
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,770
and I'm the M in MK Factor.

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,160
I do a lot of the circuit
board design and the code.

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,640
- So what about the K in MK Factor?

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,360
Oh, wait, that's me. (audience laughing)

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,743
I do graphic design and assembly.

21
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,770
In February this year,

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,690
DEF CON did something
they've never done before.

23
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,588
They have put out a call for badge makers.

24
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:02,300
So what made you decide to apply?

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,590
- So we've made a lot of badges
for different conferences

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,540
and we've joked in the past
about wouldn't it be cool

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,610
to do the DEF CON badge someday?

28
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,670
And this was our chance, so we took it.

29
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,683
- All right and,

30
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,090
that process was definitely
an emotional roller coaster.

31
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,860
- Yes, it was.

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,860
- Between the calls and
each stage of the process

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,764
was nerve wracking.

34
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:30,910
- Yeah, it took about a month for DEF CON

35
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,670
to decide which team they wanted

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,060
to do their badge,

37
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,440
and a special shout out to
Zevlag and Professor Plum

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,670
for giving us some
encouragement throughout this.

39
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,860
- We needed it.
- Yeah.

40
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,260
- Yeah.

41
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,260
So when we were awarded the
badge, how did you feel?

42
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,000
- Scared?
(both laughing)

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,660
It's a big thing.
- Yeah.

44
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,040
Kinda just sat there in shock,

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,820
but it was the end of March
and that gave us four months

46
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,232
to finish and so we had
to get our butts in gear.

47
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:04,092
- Yeah.

48
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:07,280
- We had a couple, not a couple,

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,590
quite a few snags while
producing this badge.

50
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,670
Do you wanna name a few?

51
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,702
- Yeah, so a lot of supply
chain issues this year,

52
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,980
for those who aren't aware,

53
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,220
there's a worldwide chip shortage,

54
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,820
which is all kinds of fun.

55
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,100
So our main microcontroller,

56
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,170
we changed three or four times.

57
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,530
We would pick one that was
available that fit our needs

58
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,310
and design a board around it,

59
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,770
send out for prototypes,

60
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,160
and before we even got 'em back,

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,590
someone would buy all those chips.

62
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,450
So in the end-
- Yes.

63
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,520
- We just decided to pick a chip

64
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,670
that we figured would work for us

65
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,363
and buy as many as we
needed without even testing.

66
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,240
- Yeah, we felt kinda
like anyone who's trying

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
to buy a house right now, super cricked.

68
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,670
All right, so also another
snag we had was key caps.

69
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,670
We had chosen which ones we
wanted and we found a supplier,

70
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,060
and when it came time to
order, they disappeared.

71
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,100
So we had a big decision to be made,

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,520
either change the key cap what we wanted,

73
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,520
or print our own and make what we wanted.

74
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,080
So as you can tell, we
chose to make our own.

75
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,300
This way, we were able to
do our own personal designs

76
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,130
and to be able to put DEF
CON right onto the key cap.

77
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,610
So we have about seven printers

78
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,190
going all the time, printing key caps.

79
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,910
It's great fun.
(Michael laughs)

80
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,010
All right, we also have
put together a little film

81
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,263
of the process of making this badge.

82
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,270
- Roll the video.

83
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,963
- Hey, welcome to the making
of the DEF CON 29 Badge.

84
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,320
All right. Let's get started.

85
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,490
Oh, so pretty,
(Michael laughs)

86
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,130
love all the colors together.

87
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,063
- Yeah, so this is all the
DEF CON badges minus the uber.

88
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:04,980
- That one, we're
keeping a secret for now.

89
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,020
- Yep, so this is going to
be about how we got here,

90
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,983
how we made all these,
the process, everything.

91
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,300
First, let's talk about
the badge you've got.

92
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,593
So, this is the human badge,

93
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,040
obviously four keys, right?

94
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,160
They are mechanical keyboard keys,

95
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,860
and they're Blues, because
they're clicky and awesome.

96
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,060
On the right side,

97
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,610
under the signal bars
here is a touch slider.

98
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,460
And the default for that is

99
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,260
controlling volume on your computer.

100
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,450
The other ones are set as some defaults

101
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,830
for controlling Discord,
but it's all changeable.

102
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,930
You can modify it to be whatever you want.

103
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,740
When you plug it into your computer,

104
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,330
it will show up as a keyboard

105
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,080
as well as a virtual COM port.

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,930
So you can connect to it
with any serial terminal

107
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,780
and change settings, change
the keys, all that good stuff.

108
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,780
- In the booklet, you'll
find some pre-made legends,

109
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,100
for you guys can use there to the size

110
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,230
of the actual key caps.

111
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,830
- Yup, and the key caps are in two parts.

112
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,003
So they do pop open.

113
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,993
So, there you can kinda
see that a little bit.

114
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,700
There are two, there's
a little cap on there

115
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,980
you can pop off

116
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,000
and then put a little
piece of paper in there.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,250
- Here are they, separated

118
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,933
and they just click back on.

119
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,343
- Yep.

120
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,980
So as well as being a programmable keypad,

121
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,143
there are some interactive things,

122
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,443
connect to your fellow
attendees over the USB cable.

123
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,100
So let's talk about that real quick.

124
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,100
So lanyard looks like this
for the people in person

125
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,170
and on this end pops out

126
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,960
and it is a USB-C cable

127
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,790
so that you can connect
it to your computer,

128
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,790
but also the badges have
USB-C and USB-A ports on them.

129
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,530
So you can connect between
badges, you can plug there,

130
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,010
plug this into someone else's badge,

131
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,960
and we've got some games and
other fun things you can do,

132
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,193
as well as some challenges built in there.

133
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:40,990
- All good fun.

134
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,110
- Right, so for those of
you who got virtual badges,

135
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,820
your badges came without
final code on them.

136
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,020
We did that on purpose
because there are challenges

137
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,807
and all kinds of stuff
associated with the badge,

138
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:54,390
we didn't you guys to
have a two week lead time

139
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,920
on everyone else, that's not very fair.

140
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,833
- Spoilers.

141
00:06:57,774 --> 00:07:00,360
- So, you guys have very basic code

142
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,790
where you can change the keys

143
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,730
and stuff like that, but not much else.

144
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,000
So to reprogram your badge,

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
normally when you turn it on

146
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,260
all the lights light up and everything.

147
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,150
If you hold this bottom right button,

148
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,220
when you turn it on, it will
go into a boot loader mode,

149
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,580
and when you connect it to your computer,

150
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,520
it will show up as a flash drive.

151
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,080
And then you can just drag and drop

152
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,883
the new firmware file onto
it and it'll reprogram it.

153
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,590
Right, so we kinda talked about
this a little bit already,

154
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,968
but we didn't have a lot of
time to design this badge,

155
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:37,520
about four months.

156
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,520
And right before we got, we
knew we were going to do this,

157
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,963
we had planned a trip to see
some family across country.

158
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,370
So-

159
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,050
- We drove cross country. (Katie laughs)

160
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,990
And this is Michael
sitting there figuring out

161
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,110
which microcontroller we want to do use.

162
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,460
- Yeah, sitting in my
mother-in-law's house

163
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,600
with a laptop and an extra
screen trying to design a badge.

164
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,790
- Going through schematics,

165
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,810
figuring out if it's gonna work,

166
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,310
and then I think we looked at
two different microcontrollers

167
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,215
while we were there
- Yeah.

168
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:16,300
- And both were bought out
before we could get them.

169
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,263
- Yep.
- It was great. Super great.

170
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,030
(Michael sighs)

171
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,263
- So these are some of
the early concept designs.

172
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,900
- Yeah, we, early on, wanted something

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,600
that would connect together.

174
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,730
And so we first originally thought,

175
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,020
oh, we'll make a, like a circle, right?

176
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,668
But that's done previously before.

177
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:45,228
And then we had the idea of Q'bert

178
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:49,180
and do a tessellating thing.

179
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,180
So that's how we ended
up with our original,

180
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,823
our design that we've chosen.

181
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,993
- So this was our first prototype.

182
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,720
And there's Katie soldering it together.

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,580
- And no burns,

184
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,880
so I think that's a win.
(Michael laughs)

185
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,563
Yeah, we were excited to see
the tessellating happening.

186
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,680
- So this one on the right
was our second prototype

187
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,700
and here a little sneak
preview of the uber sketches

188
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,350
and things we were working on with that.

189
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,960
All right, let's talk about key caps

190
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,951
on these printers.
(both laughing)

191
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,497
- Our army of printers. (Katie laughs)

192
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:35,090
- Yeah, how we got there.

193
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,180
So we mentioned a little bit before,

194
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,180
we had a vendor who flaked
on us about two months ago,

195
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,220
which didn't leave us with a lot of time

196
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,743
to come up with other options.

197
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,820
I reached out to a couple
dozen different companies

198
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,010
that could make key caps,

199
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,180
and the story was either
they couldn't do 'em in time,

200
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,130
or they couldn't do 'em in
anything that was translucent,

201
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,230
or they wanted crazy
amounts of money for them.

202
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,883
So in the end, we
decided to print our own.

203
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,720
So we bought one printer,

204
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,020
- To see if it could work.

205
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,040
- Yep, just to try it out.

206
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,803
And we figured out what
did and didn't work.

207
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,620
See lots of different
types of key cap designs,

208
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,210
we went through.

209
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,410
- The green stuff doesn't work

210
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,243
on cleaning them well

211
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:28,190
- Yeah, it doesn't do them well at all

212
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,263
- It stains them,

213
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,810
super cool.
- Yep.

214
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,510
- Especially if you want clear ones.

215
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,880
- Yeah. (Mike laughs)

216
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,863
So, in the end, it worked, we
bought seven printers total.

217
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,380
- And we named them all,
- Yes

218
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,740
- Because then we could have something

219
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,137
to yell at when they were not cooperating.

220
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:54,630
We named all of our,
like, all the printers.

221
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,160
And then we also named the vats,

222
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,704
they hold the resin in them.

223
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:01,220
So that way we know which vats were broken

224
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,965
and easier for communication.

225
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:07,470
So all of our vats, we
originally had seven.

226
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,800
So, of course, we went with seven dwarves

227
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,360
and then we ended up
getting two more printers

228
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,140
and that meant two more vats,

229
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,490
so we went with Prince
Charming and Snow White.

230
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,810
And then our printers' names are-

231
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,072
- We've got Seven and Kit, Steve,

232
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:31,072
Kaylee, Kevin, Dave and Jarvis.

233
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:36,763
- Yep, so if you want
to know more about that,

234
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:40,150
well, we explain why we
chose some of the names.

235
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,680
Some, I feel like are a
little explanatory so.

236
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,080
- Yeah, so another
thing with the key caps,

237
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,410
we got to customize them.

238
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,280
So every key cap has
DEF CON embedded in it,

239
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,980
right on the front of the key cap.

240
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,200
So that's something we
wouldn't have been able to do

241
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,093
with any other manufacturer.

242
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:05,106
One of the other big pluses
to this is about a month ago,

243
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,897
Dark Tangent came to us and said,

244
00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:08,630
"Hey, we're going to run out of badges

245
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,790
before DEF CON starts, what do we do?"

246
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,150
And the key caps being
one of the main pieces

247
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,650
meant that we were
producing them ourselves,

248
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,650
so making more wasn't a huge problem,

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,900
whereas if they were being
made by someone else,

250
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,841
we would have been up a creek.

251
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:28,731
- Yeah. So that's when
we bought the second two,

252
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:32,430
the six and seven printer
- Yep.

253
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,200
So Dave and Jarvis.
- Yep.

254
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,080
So this is what the key caps look like

255
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,583
right off the printer.

256
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,530
You can see there's one missing here.

257
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,390
So that one didn't print properly,

258
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,240
which is a pain in the butt,

259
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,400
'cause then you've got to clean
off the bottom of the vat.

260
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,827
- So many times.

261
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:53,630
- So what we do then is,

262
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,150
this is a removable metal plate here

263
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,370
that's on a magnetic sheet.

264
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,670
So we pull that off and put a new one on

265
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,970
and set it to print again.

266
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,880
And then this is our cleaning station.

267
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,186
- Oh, so fun.

268
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:13,186
So we got each vat, like,
bucket is filled with alcohol.

269
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,100
We have our first bucket,

270
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,890
which is the primary rinse

271
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,670
where it gets a lot of more resin into it.

272
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,650
- Yep.

273
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,010
- So let's it soak
there, helping it release

274
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,070
from the metal plate.

275
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,470
Then we got a magnetic
stirrer on the bottom

276
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,420
of our second bucket and
it's a lot more cleaner.

277
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,180
So that way it gives an extra wash

278
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,990
and then we will put it in a cup

279
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,810
and fill it with alcohol,

280
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,280
which is from our third bucket,

281
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,280
which has a filter to help
keep it clean the whole time,

282
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,574
and then we'll cure it.

283
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:55,850
That's the word
- Yep.

284
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,750
- I'm looking for.

285
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,360
- This is the curing station

286
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,010
and then put 'em out on a drying rack.

287
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,870
We got a fan here running to dry them off.

288
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,060
- We have fans, everywhere.

289
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,190
Ventilation is key

290
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,023
when you're dealing

291
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:09,260
with this much alcohol.
- Yeah.

292
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,513
- Big fan at the window,

293
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:13,270
the smell of the alcohol

294
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,650
and the resin in here is not great.

295
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,587
And we're even using the
plant-based eco resin,

296
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:21,190
that's not as smelly, it's still a lot

297
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,141
- Oh, it smells so bad.
(Mike laughs)

298
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:28,130
We originally were curing in water,

299
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,470
but that meant we had to
completely dry our key caps

300
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,920
from the second wash of the alcohol.

301
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,402
Otherwise it reacted funny
and would make a white,

302
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:41,470
it would make them turn
white, instead of clear.

303
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,303
- Yeah.

304
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:44,860
- And then we had the realization, well,

305
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,560
alcohol is clear like water.

306
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,150
So we, we figured out
how to reuse the water,

307
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,680
so that it wouldn't have all the particles

308
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,330
or reuse the alcohol,

309
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,640
so it didn't have any
of the extra particles

310
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,820
of cured resin and that's
worked brilliantly.

311
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,462
It sped up the process so much more.

312
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:05,295
- Yeah.

313
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,492
- So it's been fun, a lotta learning.

314
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:08,325
- Yeah.

315
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,452
So with all that isopropyl alcohol,

316
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:17,230
we use a lot of it to clean these parts

317
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,710
and it's expensive in large quantities.

318
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,674
So we created a device
(Katie laughs)

319
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:27,080
to clean the alcohol. (Mike laughs)

320
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,380
So...

321
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,140
- My inner Hawkeye is really proud.

322
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,790
- So what we do is we take this,

323
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,240
the dirty bucket of resin and alcohol mix.

324
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,530
It gets pretty cloudy
and nasty after a while,

325
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,790
and we put it in this pot

326
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,810
and then this bucket is full of water,

327
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,920
and we use our sous vide cooker

328
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,430
to bring it up to the proper temperature

329
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,340
at which the alcohol will
boil, come through here.

330
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,840
This one's full of water
and it's got a coil

331
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,840
of the coiled copper tube
and that cools the steam

332
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,510
and then it collects in this bucket,

333
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,610
and then we've got nice,
fresh, clean alcohol.

334
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,270
- You can see behind us,

335
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,430
we have fresh thing of it right now.

336
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,740
- Yep.

337
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,740
So we can reclaim about 75%
of the alcohol that we use,

338
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,340
which helps a ton.

339
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,180
- In cost and time, 'cause
running to the store

340
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,640
to get the alcohol, that takes time

341
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,050
and then you end up buying snacks,

342
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,410
so that also takes money

343
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,560
so (both laughing) this
saves those time and money.

344
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,710
- Yeah, so this is in the middle,

345
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,639
this is what's left after
most of the alcohol boils off,

346
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,937
the resin tends to congeal
into this nasty stuff-

347
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:43,770
- Yummy.

348
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,440
- Yeah, which we then scoop out

349
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,540
and then set it outside for it to dry,

350
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,160
and that also cures the resin

351
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,010
so that it can be thrown away safely.

352
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,840
Speaking of resin, here's
some mostly empty bottles.

353
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,970
So once we've dumped
everything out that we can,

354
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,110
we leave them upside down for a few days

355
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,750
so that everything collects in the bottom

356
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,460
and then we can pour it

357
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,143
all back into one bottle,
so we don't waste any.

358
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,840
- Yep. It's lots of fun just sitting there

359
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,170
holding the bottles over
each other. (Michael laughs)

360
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,352
So we're great.

361
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:22,080
But it's amazing how much
you'll actually get out

362
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,060
from doing that and so that
helps with cost as well.

363
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,790
- Yeah, especially with
how much resin we're using.

364
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,500
We're making 54,000 key caps,

365
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,439
and using-
- Too many.

366
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,943
- I think we bought 80 bottles of resin,

367
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:36,927
it's a lot-
- And not like

368
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:39,357
the little bottles.
- The big one liter bottles.

369
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:40,783
It's a crazy amount.

370
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,720
- But we're almost there.

371
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,130
- Yeah.

372
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,095
- Of course our kids have been helping.

373
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:49,270
They love to help him
play with the 3D printers

374
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,797
and help us assemble badges.

375
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:52,530
- It's like Christmas all the time.

376
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,226
We have packages showing up all the time.

377
00:17:55,226 --> 00:17:57,893
(both laughing)

378
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,470
- All right.
- So pretty.

379
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,400
- Assembly, (Katie laughs)
so these panels on the left,

380
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,900
these are actually the first panels we got

381
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,340
from our assembly house.

382
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,290
This is how they come to us,

383
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,070
and so we've gotta break 'em apart,

384
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,280
break off the rails on the sides,

385
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,320
break 'em apart and then break
off all these little tabs

386
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,310
in between that hold them together. So-

387
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,990
- We don't have any like flesh left

388
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,279
on our fingertips anymore

389
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,730
but it's alright.
- Yeah (Mike laughs)

390
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,500
So one of the things we ran into

391
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,850
with the first boards is, these
little spring contacts here,

392
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,541
there's three on each
board and they connect

393
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,520
to the touch slider on the top.

394
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,570
And if you notice

395
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,790
these ones up here are
a little bit shorter,

396
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,890
they were damaged in shipping.

397
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,140
So what happened is,

398
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,530
the panels sitting on top of each other,

399
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,700
squishing it against each other

400
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,730
and rubbing around during
shipping, squished those enough

401
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,930
to permanently compress them.

402
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,823
So they're too short to work anymore.

403
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,340
So we worked with our assembly house

404
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,730
and they came up with a really awesome way

405
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,200
to ship these boards to us
without them getting damaged.

406
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,074
- Thank you so much.

407
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:14,610
We truly greatly appreciate all you do

408
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,090
to keep them safe for travel.

409
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,780
We really, really appreciate it.

410
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,260
- Yeah, this connector up
here is a little wonky.

411
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,040
So another thing they did is
add some little epoxy glue dots

412
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,760
underneath these connectors
to keep them down

413
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,510
because we've got two
sides of the assembly.

414
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,320
So we do all this stuff on the top

415
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,900
and then they flip over the boards

416
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,450
and run all the bottom parts.

417
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,070
And so these ones were so heavy,

418
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,070
they were starting to fall out a little.

419
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,150
And I also want to give a shout out

420
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,450
to PCBX who did our assembly.

421
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,820
They've been amazing to work with.

422
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,460
They've been able to fix
things and change processes

423
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,570
to make things work better

424
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,460
and having done overseas assembly,

425
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,350
it's really, really nice to
have someone in the States

426
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,680
who I can actually talk to and
they respond within minutes

427
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,120
rather than half a day.

428
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,890
And there's no language barrier.

429
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,260
It's really, really nice to
have someone in the States

430
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,850
that's local and knows what they're doing.

431
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,240
- And he's very upfront
with what he wants,

432
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,710
and what he needed, and we
are really grateful to them.

433
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,543
- Yeah.

434
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,270
- Do you wanna do it? (Katie laughs)

435
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,190
- Yeah, and these edge
connectors, for another fun thing,

436
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,483
we found out too late.

437
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,780
So even though we followed

438
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,150
the manufacturer footprint exactly

439
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,980
what was happening is the surface tension

440
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,390
of the solder on these pads

441
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,200
and the ones underneath were pushing these

442
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,800
off the edge of the board just enough

443
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,907
to where this little lip
falls down off the front,

444
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:51,830
and so the connectors are
angled down just a little bit,

445
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,663
which, it doesn't really
matter, they work just fine.

446
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,222
It's just not perfect. (Mike laughs)

447
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,904
- We don't have OCD issues,
it's fine. (Katie laughs)

448
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:02,210
- This is one of those things
where if we had more time,

449
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,210
we would have run some test
boards and panels ahead of time,

450
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,610
nut with such a short schedule,
we didn't have that option.

451
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,020
So they're all like this, but they work

452
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:14,310
and it's just fine.

453
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,710
- I'm pretty happy.
- Yeah.

454
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,313
- They're done. (Katie laughs)
- Yeah.

455
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,400
So all the assembly is happening

456
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,030
in our little house. (Michael laughs)

457
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,113
- Welcome to my mess. (Katie laughs)

458
00:21:25,113 --> 00:21:28,360
- So this is a bucket of boards

459
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,030
that have the tops put on them

460
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,960
and they've been programmed.

461
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
They're waiting to get
all the key switches

462
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,860
and key caps on 'em.

463
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,980
- All our bubble wrap

464
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,110
- that we have from-
- Yeah.

465
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,610
- Protecting the boards.
- Yep.

466
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,240
- Shows how much he cares for the boards

467
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,670
as much as us.

468
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,503
- Yeah.

469
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,512
So here's our-

470
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:52,787
- late night programming sessions.

471
00:21:52,787 --> 00:21:55,829
Yeah, this was a very long night.

472
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:57,990
So yeah, you can see our
programming stations,

473
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,840
piles of boards ready to
have their tops put on 'em.

474
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,909
So one thing in here with
those little spring contacts,

475
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:07,130
because they're so fragile,

476
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,210
we gotta immediately, separate
the panels, program 'em,

477
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,000
get them over here, put the tops on 'em.

478
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,150
Then they can go in buckets

479
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,050
and go through the rest of the process.

480
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,778
- Been a lot safer.

481
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:18,710
- But until they've got
that top board on 'em,

482
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,753
it's really easy to break 'em.
- Yeah.

483
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:25,929
- Some more pictures,
me programming badges.

484
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,560
So these tests jigs have
actually worked really well. So-

485
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,010
- They've put up with some abuse. -

486
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,870
- Yeah, so we've got the normal, you know,

487
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,210
pogo pins here and then four brass pins

488
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,090
to locate the badges on there,

489
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,990
so we can just shove it down on there.

490
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,250
These over here are some little,

491
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,710
they go in the side
connectors to test those.

492
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,260
So as you push the board down,
those rotate down into place

493
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,710
and push those connectors in.

494
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:02,140
To program 'em, we're using
these little APNL dev boards,

495
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,078
and we kinda hijacked

496
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:07,950
the internal debug stuff.
(Katie coughs)

497
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,450
So normally it's connected
between the debug chip

498
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,400
and the main microcontroller
on that board,

499
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,560
but we needed to get that off the board.

500
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,360
So the board has this little connector

501
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,840
for connecting an
external fancier debugger

502
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,400
to this board, to the chip,

503
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,520
we basically cut the lines
between the chip on there

504
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,650
and the internal debug stuff,

505
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,370
and added a little switch

506
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,850
so I can switch it back and forth

507
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,030
and then connect that debug connector out

508
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,250
to our test jig to program our boards.

509
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,020
- Kinda Frankensteined it, it's fine.

510
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,260
- Not the way it's meant to be used,

511
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,360
but it works really well.

512
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,220
And these dev boards are pretty cheap

513
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,450
compared to production style programmers.

514
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,283
- And they do pretty good,

515
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:50,370
they've handled the workload so far,

516
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,533
which is really nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

517
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,650
Some of our family helping.

518
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,360
- So to get our first batch out,

519
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,548
we called the troops in,

520
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:03,758
helps that he's the eldest of eight,

521
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:06,903
so (Katie laughs) yay big families.

522
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,180
- Yeah, I spent a crazy weekend getting

523
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,610
all the first batch of virtual badges out.

524
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,384
- You're welcome.
- It was nuts.

525
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,900
(Katie laughs)

526
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,700
- Little more of the family.
- Yep.

527
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,523
- It was definitely not
quiet. (Katie laughs)

528
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,350
- All right, so we kinda talked

529
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,950
about the lanyards a little bit.

530
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,830
They're really awesome and they
came individually packaged.

531
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,510
- Which was awesome.
- Yeah,

532
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,540
we were not expecting that

533
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,579
So that's amazing
- Yeah

534
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:40,470
Then that saves us a ton of time.

535
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,303
- Yeah.

536
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:44,821
- They're super soft, I really like 'em.

537
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:45,654
- Yeah.

538
00:24:47,757 --> 00:24:50,330
- So this is a little
close-up of the lanyard there,

539
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,530
this was the test or sample
one that they sent us

540
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,410
before we ordered 'em.

541
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,344
And for those curious, I did open it up.

542
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,393
to see what's inside.

543
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,120
The wires are actually
braided down the lanyard

544
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,953
which is really nice.

545
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:08,590
So it's not a flat flex cable in there

546
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,140
that's gonna break,

547
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,443
these are more like
what's in headphone wires.

548
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,109
- Just be gentle.
- Yeah.

549
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:20,109
- Still durable, but no yanky.
(both laugh)

550
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:23,890
- This is what 10,000 coin
cell batteries looks like.

551
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,150
- It's kinda beautiful
innit? (Kate laughs)

552
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,150
- Yeah, the scale of this
project is ridiculous.

553
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,940
Here's 40,000 key switches.

554
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,820
It's just a crazy number.

555
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,090
This was before we
added onto the quantity.

556
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,370
So now we've got 54,000 of these.

557
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,470
- There are boxes everywhere.
(Kate laughs)

558
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,968
- Yep, so we alternate
between these two things.

559
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,870
- Constantly. (Mike laughs)

560
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,480
You may have seen me
yawn when not meaning to,

561
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,419
but that's where we're at at this point.

562
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,252
- Yeah, so much.
(Kate laughs)

563
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,180
So, as many badge makers know,

564
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,990
the never ending project.
- Yeah.

565
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,150
- and who else did not sing it?

566
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,290
Cause I sing it every
time I see. (both laugh)

567
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:14,547
- Yeah, this project we're
in this, the three months now

568
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:17,120
and it feels like it'll never end,

569
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,910
but by the time you guys see this,

570
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,743
it'll be done.

571
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:22,470
- And we'll feel more like this.

572
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,360
- Yeah, you see us at the
con like this, you know why.

573
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,510
- Don't ask why we're crying,
just be, think it's okay.

574
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,853
Give us candy and say,
we're pretty. (both laugh)

575
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,440
- It's been a heck of a
project, but it's been good

576
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,250
and we're excited to do it.

577
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,437
- Do it and to be done.
- Yeah.

578
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:46,580
We hope you enjoy and
thank you for letting us

579
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,377
be your badge makers this year.

580
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:49,210
- Yeah.

581
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,430
- Welcome back, that looked
like a lot of work, Michael.

582
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,780
- Definitely is.

583
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,610
- Well, I would like to thank MK Factor

584
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,800
for being here and taking time
out of their busy schedule

585
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,611
to talk with us.

586
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:03,800
- Thank you for having us.

587
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,710
- So join us next time
on BETWEEN TWO PRINTERS

588
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,700
where we will talk
about the different ways

589
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,550
of decompressing after
making a DEF CON badge.

590
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,670
See you next time.

591
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,641
- Bye-bye.

592
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:18,141
(upbeat electronic music)
