00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,989
- My name is Befekadu Mengesha

2
00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:04,106
I'm an on application engineer

3
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:05,276
at Keysight Technologies.

4
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:06,255
In this video,

5
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:10,692
I am going to demonstrate a
proof of concept for this part

6
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:12,190
of the project.

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,270
With this graphical user interface

8
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,020
ON ELSU ELAS.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,660
With an IP address of 10 40 88 70

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,493
as a TX.

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,155
Therefore we set the mode
as a TX and random access

12
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:30,188
bandwidth ID to 8

13
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:31,446
and then miss

14
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:35,022
the plain text message to
be sniffed by the receiver.

15
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:38,355
UE is saved to "Welcome to the DEF CON".

16
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,637
Similarly,

17
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:42,055
we have said

18
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:43,638
the UE

19
00:00:43,638 --> 00:00:44,471
be on

20
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,032
ELSU B

21
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:48,660
with an IP address of

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,493
10

23
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:50,326
14

24
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:51,159
88

25
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,423
1 5 7

26
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:54,105
of the RX.

27
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:57,521
Therefore we set the mode to RX

28
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:01,104
and the random access
preamble ID to eight.

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,660
On the Creative talk side

30
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,660
the PRT script activated the
5G and standard load cell

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,110
with the synchronization signal block

32
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,320
is broadcasted via the XM

33
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,763
platform with the periodicity
of 20 millisecond.

34
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,280
If the master information
blocks is decoded with success

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,780
on both

36
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,613
UE

37
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:28,260
for the sales

38
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,730
will get sync.

39
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,260
And in service

40
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,803
if the system information
block type one is decoded.

41
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,120
Since both UE are

42
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,660
in service

43
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,960
and in sync and idle,

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,660
we can connect the GUE

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,020
to the

46
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,710
layer three test to manager

47
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,420
and verify if the

48
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,540
CB's

49
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,373
decoded.

50
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,963
Then the set should get in service.

51
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,263
We can run the scenario
from the RX side first now,

52
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,823
and from the TX side.

53
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,840
It seems that the transmitted message is

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,230
with success on

55
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,660
from the TX side.

56
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,550
And let's verify if the receiver UE side

57
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,890
decoded the message

58
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,913
successfully.

59
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,610
So from the scenario logger

60
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,880
here we have decoded that

61
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:34,847
the message.

62
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:37,583
"Welcome to the DEF Conference"

63
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,580
From the TX side,

64
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,290
it can be verified that

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,400
the message too

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,100
is decoded with the

67
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,630
valid RA.

68
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,910
Also on the RX side,

69
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,363
we can check.

70
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,000
The message too is decoded

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,510
with the valued RA

72
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,920
as of

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,030
TX

74
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,203
UE

75
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:13,280
that this is a case
where we can also verify

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,203
the message through three is decoded.

77
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:19,190
We have success first from the

78
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,163
TX side.

79
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,160
So here we can confirm that the

80
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,280
UE Continuation Resolution ID

81
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:31,480
is decoded with success

82
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,740
on the TX side and let's
see also on the RX sides.

83
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,590
So the RX side in this history
is also decoded with success.

84
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,940
So since we have implemented

85
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,400
a CRC

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,233
decoding,

87
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,480
if the method is

88
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,640
decoded, we can

89
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,726
see the message on the RX side too,

90
00:03:56,726 --> 00:04:00,327
but you can see the message
is decoded successfully

91
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,427
"Welcome to the DEF CON".
