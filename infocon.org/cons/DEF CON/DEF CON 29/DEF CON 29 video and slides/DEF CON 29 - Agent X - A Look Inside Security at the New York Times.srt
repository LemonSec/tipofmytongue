1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,630
- Hi, I'm Jesse Krembs,

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,120
and today we'll be taking
a look inside security

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,640
at The New York Times.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,807
This talk is also unofficially titled,

5
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:22,630
"A media security primer for hackers",

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,263
but it's really for both
journalists and hackers.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,550
Most talks start off or end
with a thank you at the end,

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,260
right, rushes off stage,
thanking all their friends,

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,630
but really I'd like to start this talk off

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,100
by saying thank you to a bunch of people.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,970
First of all, my girlfriend
for her love and support

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,480
and for putting up with all
my craziness when I'm like,

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,340
hey, honey, I need you to
get out of the apartment

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,290
while I record my talk

15
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,453
because I don't want
anyone to see me doing it

16
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:51,193
because that would be weird.

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,000
I'd also like to thank
everyone at The New York Times

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,900
who has reviewed this talk with me

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,010
and helped me make improvements

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,480
and helped me dot all the
I's and cross all the T's

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,640
and make sure everything
looks really nice and sharp.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,483
We really do try to get
the story right every time.

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,730
It's been a crazy couple of years,

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,970
and in that time we've all
gotten to watch a lot of movies

25
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,160
and have to watch the Fred Rogers movie,

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,510
it was really great.

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,000
And there's a scene in that movie

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,360
where they take a couple of moments

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,680
just to think about all
the people in their lives

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,360
who have helped them
get to the stage in life

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,860
where they are right now.

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,500
And we don't do that enough.

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,570
So let's just take a few moments right now

34
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,660
to just sit quietly and
think about all the people

35
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,503
that have helped us get to
where we are in our lives today.

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,000
All right, all right, all right,

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
let's get this show on the road.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,710
So I'm really gonna quickly
start off with my journey,

39
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,040
I think this will help
reveal some of my biases

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,330
and some of the stuff in my life

41
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,390
that kind of formed how I got here

42
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,000
and why I think certain things
are needed and some aren't.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,950
I've been a long time DEF CON goon,

44
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,993
my first DEF CON was DEF CON 6,

45
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,190
and that was a really
pivotal moment in my life.

46
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,520
Working at DEF CON really has
given me a lot of confidence,

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,180
but it's also given me a
lot of life lessons in,

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,400
A, working with really tight timelines,

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,370
really chaotic environments,

50
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,350
really challenging people,

51
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,430
and really learning about how to deal with

52
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,423
just time-based pressures in a
technical and logistical way.

53
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,770
From my experience at DEF CON,

54
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,840
I ended up starting a nonprofit
called The Hacker Foundation

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
where I had my first interactions

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,683
with the media as a subject,

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,800
but also doing a little media support,

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,840
which is also very interesting.

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,760
And that was great.

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,830
And then for years I had regular jobs,

61
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,273
I was a bike messenger,

62
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:03,832
a caterer, stuff like I was
a webmaster for a brewery,

63
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:07,900
and I was a wireless engineer,

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,620
and then I was doing offensive security

65
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,930
for the phone company.

66
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,590
Those were all great jobs,

67
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,627
people I worked with were wonderful,

68
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:17,710
but I really felt like I needed to just

69
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,890
look a little bit more at stuff.

70
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,820
And I heard about this thing

71
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,750
called the Internet Freedom
Festival in Valencia, Spain,

72
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,590
and I decided I'd go do it
and see what it was like.

73
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,840
It was really different conference

74
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,186
from DEF CON in a lot of ways, a lot of,

75
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,810
it was very different
from a lot of hacker cons,

76
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,290
but similar in the way
that all festivals are.

77
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,230
And I got to meet a bunch of journalists

78
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,240
from around the world there,

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,790
and I was talking to, they had these.

80
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,900
Okay, so they had these little tiny beers

81
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,723
called cana in Spain for
one euro, it's really great.

82
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:51,660
It's a little small beer,

83
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,090
it's got just as much beer as you want.

84
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,330
So I'm having a beer with this journalist

85
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,430
and we're talking about
stuff and he's like,

86
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,820
oh, I have this source I want to talk to.

87
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,000
I want to talk to kind of,

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,060
I don't wanna be overwatched
by the government.

89
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,400
And so I'm like, okay, we'll
just call him on Signal,

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,810
that's a really good method.

91
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,750
And he says, oh, no, no, he
doesn't have a cell phone.

92
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,230
I'm like, oh, okay.

93
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,510
Well, you have to come on landline,

94
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,300
here's some stuff you can
do to minimize the risk,

95
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,443
you can't negate it,
but you can minimize it.

96
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,420
And he goes, oh, no, no, he
doesn't have that type of phone,

97
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,940
he has this type of phone.

98
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,940
And I'm like, oh, interesting.

99
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,600
So this is the importance
of getting more details.

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,180
So basically the source that
he was trying to talk to

101
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,060
was a villager who had a party line.

102
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,990
So if you called that number,

103
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,790
you called everyone in that village.

104
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:47,960
So, and I was like, this
is a really hard problem,

105
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,390
I don't have a solution for you now.

106
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,810
And I still actually don't have
a solution for this problem,

107
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,620
but it stuck with me,
it sticks with me today.

108
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,560
I think about this problem,
I think it's a really good,

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,393
an interesting problem.

110
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:01,240
And these are some of the
technical security challenges

111
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,940
that journalists are dealing with.

112
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,920
And so I left Valencia, Spain,

113
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,110
went back to my regular life as it were,

114
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,450
but I kept thinking about

115
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,820
what was this, this stuff.

116
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,790
And I started spending
more time in New York City,

117
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,653
and there I saw someone
very special there.

118
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:28,110
And then I saw a job open
at The New York Times,

119
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,940
I said, no, you won't get
the chance to do this again,

120
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,900
you should apply.

121
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,440
So I applied, I contacted someone I knew

122
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,580
with The New York Times and said,

123
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,500
hey, can you reach into
the pile and pull mine out

124
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,210
because I have a
non-traditional background,

125
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,100
my resume not even get seen by anyone.

126
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,590
So my resume got passed
around to some folks,

127
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,720
they looked at it, I did a phone screen,

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,060
I did an interview, I
did another interview,

129
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,123
I did a day's worth of
in-person team interviews,

130
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,793
and they liked me, they really liked me.

131
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,330
So I got a job offer and I took it,

132
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,210
and that's how I ended up
with The New York Times.

133
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,850
I applied for the job, get the job,

134
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,250
not that complicated, right?

135
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,470
And since day one, it's
been a very exciting,

136
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,123
fulfilling and rewarding job.

137
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,130
And that's the quick version of

138
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,510
how I ended up with The New
York Times working full-time

139
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,510
in media journalism.

140
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,010
I think it's important
though to think about

141
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,703
what gets you up every day,

142
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,120
the getting the job is not
the end of the journey,

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,690
it's the beginning of the journey

144
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,100
or it's beginning another
phase of the journey.

145
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,520
So one of the things I
really like about my job is

146
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,760
that I think this is sort of good,

147
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,310
I think news-making organizations,

148
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,500
The Fourth Estate is a
key part of a country

149
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,710
and it's really important

150
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,030
to be an engaged citizen in that country,

151
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,170
so I basically do that all the time now,

152
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,810
which is really nice.

153
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,230
The job isn't just about
protecting shareholder value,

154
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,963
we are a publicly traded company,

155
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,110
but it's not just about making money,

156
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,570
it really is a very
mission-oriented job and company,

157
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,630
which is great, I really enjoy that.

158
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,020
The problems are hard, they're
hard in both technical ways,

159
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,973
but also in logistical
and very human ways.

160
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,320
If you have a really whizzbang,

161
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,590
super-awesome technical solution,

162
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,470
but you can't explain it
to somebody over the phone,

163
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,450
or they don't have the equipment,

164
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,110
or they don't even know
how to use the technology,

165
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,500
it doesn't matter, right,
it won't solve the problem.

166
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,593
So coming up with
solutions that are really,

167
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,110
work in a variety of environments

168
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,370
and a variety of stressors
is really, really a delight.

169
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,333
So that's great.

170
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,400
The people at The New
York Times are characters,

171
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,160
there is tons of great characters,

172
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,599
they make movies about these people,

173
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,900
but then you end up
meeting them in the hall

174
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,840
and having coffee with
them and being like,

175
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,403
huh, interesting.

176
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,173
They're a fun bunch,

177
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,060
and they're driven and they're passionate

178
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,080
and they're persistent,

179
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,193
which is I think a lot of
qualities that hackers enjoy.

180
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,290
And the work is evergreen, right?

181
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,210
The work we do is, I always
feel like every day I go in,

182
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,660
we're always getting new challenges

183
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,170
and new things are always popping up,

184
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,133
the news happens all the time.

185
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,760
I also think that there is a
kind of cousin relationship

186
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,220
between journalists and hackers.

187
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,420
We're both very interested

188
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,580
in having information free to the public,

189
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,580
so the public can make
well-informed decisions.

190
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,000
Hackers really tend to be very
interested in acquiring info

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,610
and showing it off to their friends

192
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,500
because look, what I can get.

193
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,050
Journalists tend to be a
little bit more downstream,

194
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,660
they tend to be more like,

195
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,800
look at this information I
got (laughs) from some hacker,

196
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,323
this is great, let me
show it off to the world.

197
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,120
They also tend to be very rigorous

198
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,190
in their analysis of that information,

199
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,343
which I think is much needed.

200
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,860
So let's just really quickly talk

201
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,480
about New York Times by the numbers.

202
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,350
There are no typical news organizations,

203
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,900
The New York Times is an
atypical news organization

204
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,720
in many ways, it's 169 years old,

205
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,600
maybe 170 is their birthday next year.

206
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,060
Yeah.

207
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,620
As you can imagine, a company that old

208
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,730
has a lot of technical debt,

209
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,720
but it also has a lot of history,

210
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,553
and that history is good.

211
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:40,070
One of the great things
about working at The Times,

212
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,170
in the before times was
that we ran in the office

213
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,500
and many floors below the one

214
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,490
that I work on is the archive.

215
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,700
So I went down to the archive

216
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,560
and got to plough through
the paper card catalog index

217
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,423
for Felix Krembs, who is,

218
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,510
okay, I believe a great,
great cousin of mine

219
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,110
or an uncle maybe.

220
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,650
Anyway, he was a big time
broadway actor at one point,

221
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,140
and so I got to find his
name in the card catalog,

222
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,260
then go into the actual
like archive stacks

223
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,630
and pull out the digital photos of him

224
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,310
that were provided by
his agent to The Times,

225
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,370
which is and hold them and
showed them off to my family,

226
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,950
which was great.

227
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,070
Really a wonderful experience.

228
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,620
We have a lot of great
people who work at The Times,

229
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,330
we have 4,500 employees,
this includes reporters,

230
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,700
this includes people that print the paper,

231
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,010
this includes admins and tech staff,

232
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,980
this includes developers.

233
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,243
We have 1,700 reporters worldwide,

234
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,750
which is a huge amount of people to have.

235
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,810
200 of them are overseas.

236
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,073
Those 200 are really some of
the best reporters we have

237
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:50,150
because they're the only person

238
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,500
you can sometimes send to a place

239
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,370
because they're the only person

240
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,550
logistically available to do the work.

241
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,800
So they have to be well-prepared

242
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,010
and on top of the situation

243
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,520
and really understand
what's going on there.

244
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,610
They're really at the tip of pen,

245
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,450
it's very exciting to work
with our foreign journalists

246
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,850
or our overseas journalists.

247
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,380
We have 500 developers,

248
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,480
no other company makes
The New York Times app

249
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,963
and website like The New York Times.

250
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:19,860
It's new territory for
everybody all the time,

251
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,400
so we're constantly learning
and being challenged

252
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,800
and developing new things
with our developers.

253
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,690
We have 31 foreign bureaus
and 16 national bureaus,

254
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,380
so we have offices globally and nationally

255
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,750
and a variety of other facilities.

256
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,690
We are a factory that prints newspapers,

257
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,660
which is pretty cool.

258
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,320
And then now we also have a
very diversified workforce

259
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,743
who lives and works all over
the world and the country.

260
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,950
So that's a whole new challenge

261
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,147
is just that geographical spread, right?

262
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,070
We just have to keep everybody safe,

263
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,343
and (mumbles) as it were.

264
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,340
There's 7.8 million subscribers,

265
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,200
that's a lot of subscriber data,

266
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,163
that includes all kinds of PII.

267
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,240
We have 100 million plus registered users,

268
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,110
which represents a huge amount of data,

269
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,560
which we also have to
keep safe, of course.

270
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,690
And then if you actually think about that,

271
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,150
classic InfoSec training, CIA training,

272
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,780
confidentiality, integrity
and availability,

273
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,883
not the other CIA.

274
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,312
So we have to get the
paper out all the time,

275
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:31,410
we have to get the news
out on the newspaper

276
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,920
and on the website.

277
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,660
So, and that's average weekly audience

278
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,113
of 7.6 million people, that's
a lot of people to reach.

279
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,870
We move a lot of data
just in general, right?

280
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,700
We print, we produce 150 plus

281
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,800
pieces of journalism every day.

282
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,900
And it's not just print,
it's not just photos,

283
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,530
it's podcasts and TV shows
and live streams of events

284
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,800
and stuff like that.

285
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,240
And finally, there's a plus sign

286
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,700
after all the stuff on this slide, right?

287
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,430
That's because we're growing,

288
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,340
and growth brings its own challenges.

289
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,540
I used to work for a dying industry,

290
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,460
and that has its own challenges too,

291
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,630
but growth has a lot of challenges.

292
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,590
It feels fun, but it's also very scary.

293
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,030
And so I think that's a whole other

294
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,290
interesting kind of pseudo number.

295
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,190
So that's The New York Times
by the numbers in a nutshell.

296
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,049
This isn't just me,
I'm not the only person

297
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,270
at the working InfoSec at The Times

298
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,750
or even work in security.

299
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,200
The InfoSec team at The New
York Times is composed of

300
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,970
the security operations team.

301
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,870
I work on that team,
we are the front lines,

302
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,570
we answer and advise on
all kinds of questions

303
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,150
and issues every day, every hour.

304
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,470
I'm on call at this very
instant recording this talk.

305
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,070
We have an intelligence
team who does the forward

306
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,120
and backward looking
intelligence gathering

307
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,320
to help us figure out what
threats we need to align to,

308
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,930
and where to best use our resources.

309
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,950
We have an education team,

310
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,520
education is a huge part of what we do

311
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,093
because of the independence
of so much of our staff.

312
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,840
Having well-educated, well-prepared staff

313
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,320
is really very, very key.

314
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,073
Like I said, we have our own apps,

315
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:20,804
so then we have our own AppSec team,

316
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,630
which is really another key, key thing.

317
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,200
We have a secure architecture
team because we have,

318
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,200
imagine this, a giant technical,
a giant cloud presence.

319
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,860
So, of course, we have
a secure architecture.

320
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,710
Incidents happen, if they didn't happen,

321
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,690
none of us would have jobs.

322
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,183
So having an incident response
team who can guide both,

323
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,970
who can help the InfoSec
team do their job better

324
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,420
when we're responding to incidents,

325
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,150
but also guide the other people
involved in that incident

326
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,320
through the process.

327
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,153
It's wonderful.

328
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,933
I live in New York City,

329
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:00,710
and New York City has
been hit with all kinds of

330
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,013
business continuity
events within my lifetime,

331
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:06,723
and not just like in the last 20 years.

332
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,910
So that's another thing that we,

333
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,820
is also with the InfoSec sphere.

334
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,110
And then finally, of
course, we're a business,

335
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,020
so we have to manage our
risk and our compliance needs

336
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,700
just like every other business out there.

337
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,070
We're not the only security
operations at The Times,

338
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,770
we also have a physical security team,

339
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,313
nationally and internationally.

340
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,040
And all three of these teams:

341
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,597
InfoSec, national and
international, all meet together

342
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:38,260
and the threat response team
where we trade intelligence

343
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,440
and we work on ways, we overlap

344
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,770
because increasingly there
is a great deal of overlap

345
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,263
in what we all do together.

346
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,570
That's just the security apparatus, right?

347
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,890
That's the people that have
security somewhere in the title,

348
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,590
but we also have really
wonderful sys admins out there

349
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,630
who really hold the standard

350
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,630
and do a really, really good job

351
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,370
of making sure that
our systems are secure,

352
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,430
so we don't have to bug them.

353
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,610
That's so nice when you have really top

354
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,760
motivated sys admins making it happen.

355
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,210
So we don't have to be like,
hey, it's back to Tuesday,

356
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,043
you've got to patch that.

357
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:19,500
They're already like, to patch
that, I'm like even better.

358
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,360
We have a great end-user
support team out there

359
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,963
who just listens to our users.

360
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,317
So when the user says this thing,

361
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:29,000
(laughs) and they're like,
oh, that's a security event,

362
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,150
you need to talk to
these people right now.

363
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,230
And then we have folks in the newsroom:

364
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,660
editors, support staff and journalists

365
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,940
who help us coordinate,
inform us of events,

366
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,070
inform us of threats that they've gotten

367
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,470
both in the physical, but also
in the technological sphere,

368
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,830
tell us about all kinds of stuff

369
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,720
they're hearing on the street,

370
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
which is also really wonderful.

371
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,070
And then also the past has helped us.

372
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,050
We've learned a lot from the past

373
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,257
and from the people that have
been at The Times before us

374
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:04,257
who have helped build the
organization and the team.

375
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,820
So it's just not just now
that got us to where we are.

376
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,200
The present is made by the past

377
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,100
and the past has contributed mightily.

378
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,853
So here's a quick guide for
journalist security for hackers,

379
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,870
but also conversely if
you're a journalist,

380
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,003
this is also for you.

381
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,900
This is a really great graph

382
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,850
that kind of shows the threat continuum

383
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,303
for journalists out there.

384
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:39,710
And on one side we have murder

385
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,460
and on one side we have litigation.

386
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,620
Death is a very real concern
for a lot of journalists,

387
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,030
this is very high-risk
job in a lot of ways.

388
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,530
It shouldn't be, but it is.

389
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,990
And it's not typically one
would consider a high-risk job,

390
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,900
but in 2020, 66 journalists
lost their lives

391
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,510
in the course of reporting.

392
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,370
Just today I was reading in
the paper about a reporter

393
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,160
who lost their life in a conflict area.

394
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,906
And the week before a
journalist also lost their life

395
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,503
covering a parade.

396
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,990
And targeted killings by
repressive governments,

397
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,600
they're too often willing
to kill journalists

398
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,660
to keep citizens in the
dark about their actions,

399
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,590
it does happen.

400
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,700
So we always have to factor that in

401
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,770
when we're thinking about
the physical security

402
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,780
aspects of journalism.

403
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,170
This also kind of plays into the InfoSec,

404
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,490
which is not traditionally
something we would do,

405
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,470
but increasingly repressive governments

406
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,750
and non-state actors use technology

407
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,750
to assist them in precursor
activities to murder.

408
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,910
Going down the matrix really
quickly, we have harassment.

409
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,333
I have a slide for this, we'll
talk about this in a bit.

410
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,390
So the security team at The New York Times

411
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,200
doesn't protect journalism,
we protect journalists.

412
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,630
And journalists' job is
to protect journalism,

413
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,100
and that means producing
high-quality journalistic works

414
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,550
and not so censory.

415
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,610
It means that they should,

416
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,040
our job is to keep them safe enough,

417
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,930
so that they don't feel that
they can't cover a story

418
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,980
because it's too hot, it's too sensitive.

419
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,280
And this ties to the next thing, right?

420
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,270
If they think that people are after them

421
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,140
from hacking, that's an issue.

422
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,150
So we help protect against that as well.

423
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,670
Political pressure, that's
basically way above my pay grade,

424
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,010
but it's definitely
something that does stop

425
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,810
or does concern some
journalists at some times.

426
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,780
Denying access is another way

427
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,543
that journalists work
is threatened, right?

428
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,030
Either in the withholding

429
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,833
or manipulation of press
credentials or to deportation,

430
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,070
PNG, persona non grata,

431
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,220
someone out of a country,
so they can't come back

432
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,380
is something that does happen

433
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,940
and has happened in the two years

434
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,640
that I've worked with The New
York Times, two journalists.

435
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,103
Ad pressure is a factor,

436
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,050
boycotting The New York Times

437
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,950
or another news organization through ad,

438
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,700
through people that would
advertise with The Times

439
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,680
is definitely an influence
that has effected organization,

440
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,963
media organizations worldwide.

441
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,193
Censorship.

442
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,030
Right now there's some government

443
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,462
censoring The New York Times

444
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:39,660
(laughs) somewhere in the world,

445
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,653
either overtly or covertly.

446
00:20:43,772 --> 00:20:47,140
We at The Times try to
provide news to everyone

447
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,093
as much as possible all the time.

448
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,670
We, for example, I was
talking with a colleague today

449
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,440
about our Onion, The
New York Times' version

450
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,170
of the Onion Service.

451
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,410
We do have an Onion Service online,

452
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,450
and that's specifically as part of our

453
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,293
censorship busting operations.

454
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,160
Reputational attacks.

455
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,610
There are attacks against
the practice of journalism,

456
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,350
against the organization,

457
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,240
and of course, against
the reporter themselves

458
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,930
trying to de-legitimize them.

459
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,880
And that's a more long-term

460
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,640
kind of highbrow argument,

461
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,090
but I think it's also a
definite concern of journalists.

462
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,580
And then finally at the
very end of the spectrum

463
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,560
is litigation and lawfare
where we like to think

464
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,940
that very civil people
use very civil words

465
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,430
in a very civil environment

466
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,710
to try to win civil arguments.

467
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,340
It doesn't always occur,

468
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,390
but we'd like to think that that happens.

469
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,470
So there are kind of three
bins that are inherent,

470
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,040
and one of them, the last one

471
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,360
kind of doesn't fall on the matrix

472
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,860
because it kind of pervades
all of them naturally.

473
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,040
There's the physical security stuff,

474
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,340
which is an increasing
concern year after year

475
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,780
in journalism.

476
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,690
Increasingly year after
year is also the need

477
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,453
for increased information
in cybersecurity.

478
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:14,267
As technology plays a bigger
and bigger role in reporting,

479
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,280
and our lives both as
a day-to-day activity

480
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,970
but also in the nature
of how reporting is done.

481
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,770
Understanding how technology works,

482
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,100
how big data can be

483
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,957
understood and analyzed is really key.

484
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,823
Finally, there's a psychosocial
security concern here.

485
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,620
It's taken I don't know how long

486
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,760
has journalism existed
for, right, for ages.

487
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,310
It's taken a long time
for people to realize

488
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,950
that the day-to-day stresses

489
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,090
of being a journalist takes a serious

490
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,583
and possibly negative
toll on the practitioners.

491
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,690
And so when we're working with journalists

492
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,630
and we're talking about
security practices,

493
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,293
we're really trying to,

494
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,400
to train them for an ultra
marathon, not a sprint.

495
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,160
The best, most fun
journalists to hang out with

496
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,380
are the ones who have been
around the block a lot.

497
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,880
They have great stories,
they're really well seasoned,

498
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,180
and they have some really
good security practices

499
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,223
based upon some hard-won lessons.

500
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,010
So any media information
security organization

501
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,150
would definitely take a
look at all of these things

502
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,900
that are highlighted
here in bold as something

503
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,500
that they would pay attention
to on a regular basis.

504
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,950
So I mentioned harassment
at the beginning.

505
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,540
I kind of glossed over it,
but let's look at harassment,

506
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,740
we're gonna throw a
bunch of numbers at you,

507
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,973
but I think it's, I want
to get this point through.

508
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,380
So Lucy at the CPJ helped put
these numbers together for me

509
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,500
because this is not something

510
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,600
that I look at the numbers of every day,

511
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,600
but in 2019 90% of respondents
to one of their studies,

512
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,180
two journalists experienced safety issues

513
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,400
or threats in the USA,

514
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,610
which is we like to consider
one of the more safe countries

515
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,363
to be a journalist.

516
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,470
And then large numbers of journalists

517
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,360
have been harassed in various ways.

518
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,640
63% of all journalists
have been harassed online.

519
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,340
I think we in the InfoSec community

520
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,600
are familiar with the fact that
people get harassed online,

521
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,530
journalists get it all the time,

522
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,273
and they get in very real ways.

523
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,950
Following up that number very shortly,

524
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,253
very shortly behind it, 58%
have been harassed in-person.

525
00:24:38,712 --> 00:24:39,900
I have had my run-ins in life,

526
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,853
but I haven't been systematically
harassed in-person, right?

527
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,530
I can think of one or
two incidents, right?

528
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,670
But in this case, it
happens to a lot of people

529
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,940
who work in journalism.

530
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,433
Finally, this bottom number 26%

531
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,490
have been physically attacked, right?

532
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,400
So one in four, a little
bit more than one in four

533
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,563
had been attacked in the
course of doing their work.

534
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,590
That's a pretty big percentage for a job

535
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,700
that isn't really about getting
in physical altercations,

536
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,050
they're not wrestlers here.

537
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,350
And the other thing to
think about is that this is,

538
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,453
there is some disparity here, right?

539
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,793
Women get this way more
than, way worse than men.

540
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,220
Two-thirds of women respondents say

541
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,510
that they've been threatened

542
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,060
or harassed online at least once

543
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,230
according to the International
Women's Media Foundation.

544
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:41,230
And one in 10 of their people
that they've surveyed has said

545
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,880
that they had experienced a
death threat in the last year,

546
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,970
not just harassment, but
straight up death threat.

547
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,290
And I see these threats and they're real,

548
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,630
they're not, people
aren't joking (mumbles)

549
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,930
So harassment is a real issue,

550
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,380
that's something we deal
with on a regular basis.

551
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,820
And it goes hand-in-hand
with social media presence.

552
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,190
Having a strong social media
presence for a journalist

553
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,233
is a huge career asset.

554
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,330
If you look at big names
at any media organization,

555
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,530
they usually have big
followings on social media,

556
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,123
on Twitter or on Instagram or whatnot.

557
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,510
Some of the organizations
don't realize this,

558
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,540
but curating and maintaining your presence

559
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,813
on social media is work.

560
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:28,310
It's one of the reasons I don't do it

561
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,260
is because I don't wanna do the work,

562
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,397
I don't wanna have a big
social media presence

563
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:32,943
because I do other things.

564
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,630
And with that presence
will come harassment.

565
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,610
Most platforms are woefully
unprepared to provide

566
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,270
any real support regarding
online harassment,

567
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,483
both to journalists and
to just regular people.

568
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,670
I think there's plenty of evidence of that

569
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,630
if you look through the MindSphere

570
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:55,263
of the InfoSec community online.

571
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,710
So one of the places that I
always see a lot of people get

572
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,340
kind of spur of the moment
harassment is from hot takes

573
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,050
or spur of the moment comments.

574
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,050
So I always advise
journalists to be thoughtful

575
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,783
and considerate about
everything they post online,

576
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,140
and that they separate their personal

577
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,460
and their private and the public persona,

578
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,050
so they get some separation

579
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,623
because they deserve it frankly.

580
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,153
But, yeah, hot takes tend to
get people in some trouble,

581
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,880
but they should have the right
to have hot takes. (laughs)

582
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,473
People just need to start
being nicer to each other.

583
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:41,083
So really quickly people often ask me,

584
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:47,520
where does the responsibility
for security journalists lie?

585
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,970
And it really lies with
the journalists themselves.

586
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,610
The buck stops with them

587
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,927
because there's a ton
of competing interests.

588
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,710
And my interests are not necessarily

589
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,380
the same as the journalists,
same as an editor.

590
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,917
The editors' isn't the
same as the journalists

591
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,290
and the journalists' isn't the same

592
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,706
as all those other things.

593
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:08,556
Everybody has different needs
and wants and desires here.

594
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,170
So finally at the end of the day,

595
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,363
it's really the journalists' decision.

596
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,460
If they're gonna cover a story

597
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,660
and how they're gonna cover that story.

598
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,010
The job of the InfoSec
team or any security team

599
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,230
working with media is to
prepare them with the best tools

600
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,513
and knowledge available,

601
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,600
and give them the freedom and respect

602
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,270
to take care of themselves,

603
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,320
and also to do the best they
can in covering that story.

604
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,640
That's it.

605
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,600
But it's often the
journalists' job to make sure

606
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,793
it goes down correctly.

607
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,990
So let's really quickly talk
about training and advisement,

608
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,860
that's something that we
spend a lot of time doing,

609
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,883
a lot of time we do at The Times.

610
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,703
Training is lessons,

611
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,560
pre-prepared lessons

612
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,250
where we really get people
brought up to speed on

613
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,790
proper techniques and tools.

614
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,390
And advisement is when
they come to us and say,

615
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,627
hey, Jesse, I got this
question and we think about it,

616
00:29:15,627 --> 00:29:17,430
and we give them the best advice we can

617
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,713
about what they can do.

618
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,120
This is often what will happen

619
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,080
if you as a security
professional end up working with

620
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,160
any news organization or media person,

621
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,860
they will ask for advice about something.

622
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,143
So make your advice actionable.

623
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,440
Journalists have a lot
of competing interests,

624
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,520
and their time is very valuable,

625
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,520
and they basically have to
deal with a ton of stuff.

626
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,870
So making practices that are doable

627
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,163
and not theoretical is really
the best thing I can suggest,

628
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,380
but they are curious and persistent folks,

629
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,790
so expect them to ask
you challenging questions

630
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,390
about the practice or
advisement that you give them.

631
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,373
All right.

632
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,480
So here are five basic
practices for journalists.

633
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,150
As a journalist you should be doing these,

634
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,260
as a information security
professional and hacker

635
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,310
and journalists who are
asking you for advice,

636
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,220
this is the five pieces of advice

637
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,673
maybe you should give them,
it's a great starting point.

638
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,670
Use strong diverse passwords
on all your accounts.

639
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,810
Please, please, please.

640
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,410
You're gonna have a lot of
accounts as a journalist.

641
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,830
And so you're gonna need to
use strong diverse passwords.

642
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,150
This will, of course, mean

643
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,780
you need to use a password manager.

644
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,830
Any password manager out
there is probably better

645
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,303
than no password manager,

646
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,100
and a real online password
manager that's backed up

647
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,280
that's securely operated and securely run

648
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,373
is really the best solution.

649
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,910
Notebooks, things you remember,

650
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,330
iterations of things you remember

651
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,623
are really, really not, do not work.

652
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:13,830
Use second factor authentication
on everything you can,

653
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,080
as much as you can.

654
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,390
Skip over doing it with SMS though.

655
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,033
Use authenticator apps
and use hardware tokens.

656
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,083
Use authenticator apps that
backup to your password manager,

657
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,253
so that if your phone is
lost, stolen or confiscated,

658
00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:34,280
you can get back in the game real quick,

659
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,430
and you don't have to
re-enroll everything.

660
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,640
Use hardware tokens whenever possible.

661
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,123
Have two and have the codes, of course.

662
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,560
One of the key things to do
is to take that second token

663
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,293
and keep it in a safe place,

664
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,440
and not carry two with you at all times,

665
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,223
just have the one on you at all times.

666
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,320
Use a VPN, use it on
every untrusted network

667
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,153
that you run across,

668
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,470
that you're operating a
computer or a phone on.

669
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:08,040
Any untrusted network
is not your home network

670
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,020
and not your work network,

671
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,230
so pretty much all the
weird networks you jump on,

672
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,370
all the press pool networks,

673
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,010
the Olympics are at a
convention or something,

674
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,360
especially this convention.

675
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,910
Companies should have a VPN
for, again, to its own assets.

676
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,660
Journalists should
collect third-party VPNs

677
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,743
as they see fit.

678
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,520
There's a bunch of great ones out there,

679
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,560
there's plenty of market research

680
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,090
about which ones are the best.

681
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,810
Just choose one that's a high-quality

682
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,493
reputable VPN provider.

683
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,850
Keep track of your assets, where
you store your information,

684
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,000
divide your public and private assets.

685
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,470
Your work computer shouldn't
be your personal computer

686
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,563
if at all possible.

687
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,150
I know this sounds annoying,

688
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:57,150
but it's a really good thing
to do for a number of reasons.

689
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,630
If you're a freelance, I
know this is really tricky,

690
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,370
but definitely think about keeping

691
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,927
as much of your public
and private life separate

692
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:10,320
from a data compartmentalization

693
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,670
or information
compartmentalization standpoint.

694
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,250
Update early, update often.

695
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,260
I don't know anyone who suffered greatly

696
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,880
from updating to the
latest version of some OS

697
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,670
or patching their systems.

698
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,280
I do know people who have suffered greatly

699
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,383
from not doing that.

700
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,200
Use secure messaging platforms,

701
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,110
use Signal for as much
messaging as you can.

702
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,130
You can even use it to
securely store your notes,

703
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,280
you can just message
yourself notes, right?

704
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,593
Signal is a great tool, we really like it.

705
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,630
The other secure messaging
platforms out there

706
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,030
have a lot of different interests

707
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,873
that don't always seem to align
with their user interests.

708
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,870
But you're gonna have
to go with the sources,

709
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,290
so whenever possible
try to shift to Signal,

710
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,520
but if you have to use one
of those other third-party

711
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,480
messaging platforms,
secure messaging platforms,

712
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,730
do find the online
guides that are out there

713
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,563
about running those more securely,

714
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,580
so that you can minimize
your attack surface

715
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,573
and your exposure.

716
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,520
So it's not just reporters
who are part of the newsroom,

717
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,010
there's also editors out there.

718
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,000
So here's the five basic
practice for editors.

719
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,480
You really need to communicate

720
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,160
known security risks to your journalists.

721
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,450
If you know it's a security risk,

722
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,070
your journalists who is maybe
been around for a long time,

723
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,240
or maybe hasn't may not know
them for whatever reasons,

724
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,400
let them know, tell them
these are the things

725
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,730
that I am concerned about for your safety

726
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,433
or your information security
safety regarding this story.

727
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,080
When a journalist comes to
you with security concerns,

728
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,750
you need to listen to them

729
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,520
and factor them into the reporting.

730
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,150
You also need to connect that
reporter with support systems,

731
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,373
be them in-house or external
to help them stay safe.

732
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,880
It's really very, very, very
useful when an editor says,

733
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,930
hey, I've got a team, they're
gonna cover the story.

734
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,780
Can you talk to them?

735
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,830
Have a regular and clear
cadence of communication

736
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,730
with your reporters when
they are in the field.

737
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,230
This is really key.

738
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,070
Always start off the conversation

739
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,250
with the same basic question set, PSI.

740
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,780
What's the position, right?

741
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,023
Where are they in the story,
physically in the world,

742
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:31,240
and where are they in the story?

743
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,073
What's the situation?

744
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:34,140
What's the environment
around them looking like?

745
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,500
What's the situation looking like?

746
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,497
And what are they planning to do next?

747
00:35:37,497 --> 00:35:42,497
If you can have those three
pieces of information handy,

748
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,850
when something goes wrong,

749
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,190
or you think something
might be going wrong,

750
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,590
then your security team will be able to

751
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,480
find even better support.

752
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,550
And finally, you have to do

753
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,930
all the things in the previous slide.

754
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,630
You need to be the example of how to do

755
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,593
secure journalism securely.

756
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,780
So the fun never ends,
it never gets easier

757
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,673
as you move up the old
hierarchy in the newsroom tree.

758
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,240
So that's the basics for journalists

759
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,230
and editors in the newsroom.

760
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,940
Let's talk a little bit
about some of the stuff

761
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,550
that we in the InfoSec team
deal with on a regular basis,

762
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,070
and more of what we do.

763
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,720
So here's the more of what we do.

764
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,810
We help journalists and editors gather

765
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,873
and secure source material all the time,

766
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,900
we make sure that we don't
cross any legal red lines,

767
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,900
we never instruct sources
on how to get information.

768
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,970
It's not our job, we're not doing that.

769
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,050
We're really looking for sources to,

770
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,080
they had something they wanna give us,

771
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,700
they collect it and they delivered to us.

772
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,100
We operate a tips line

773
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,850
and we operate our own SecureDrop servers

774
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,630
from the Freedom of the Press Foundation,

775
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:57,280
so people can get us that information.

776
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,683
Also we will develop solutions, if needed.

777
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,410
We are always concerned about the intent

778
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,230
and operation of nation-state actors,

779
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,030
both on how they are
interacting with our journalists

780
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,280
and what capabilities they have,

781
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,780
and whether or not they've
exercised those capabilities

782
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,580
against us or other news organizations.

783
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,700
As a telecommunications guy,

784
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm super into telecommunication security,

785
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,100
so all the types of communications,

786
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,020
both in how it can be
used for surveillance,

787
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,830
how it can be used for interception,

788
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,220
so we're constantly looking at that

789
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,710
and trying to improve our own
telecommunication's security

790
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:49,030
as best we can within the
operating environment we are in.

791
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,580
We operate a factory
that makes newspapers,

792
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,600
so we have all the
industrial control systems

793
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,130
you might imagine that exist
in any factory out there,

794
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,230
which is really great.

795
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,960
It's also really challenging
because it's a lot,

796
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,530
it's very different from
a lot of the other stuff

797
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,780
we've talked about today.

798
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,600
I said it before, I'll say it again,

799
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,480
we have our own

800
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:17,330
apps that we build, so
having secure applications

801
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,610
that are both externally facing,

802
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,480
like the one in your
phone from New York Times

803
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,920
is the Crossword, but also internal apps

804
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,620
that we use to build, run
and operate the newspaper

805
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,190
or the newsroom is really key as well.

806
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,980
And so we look at the
security of those things

807
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,163
as another area of concern or focus.

808
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,900
Of course, we're concerned

809
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,140
about our cloud architecture
and infrastructure.

810
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,680
We've moved out of data
centers everywhere,

811
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,390
we're a very cloud-centric company now.

812
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,400
I think any news organization
storing data centers

813
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,483
is possibly making a mistake.

814
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,810
So having secure cloud architecture

815
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,653
that is both redundant,

816
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,740
available, but also absolutely secure

817
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,366
and admirable is really, really key.

818
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:07,880
And finally I'm gonna kind of lump into

819
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,220
enterprise security here,

820
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,460
but this is just a grey business
of the grey lady, right?

821
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,770
This is, we're just like
every other company out there.

822
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,930
So we have legacy systems
we need to keep in track of,

823
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,570
we have kind of the not-so exciting

824
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,390
information security
things like your HR systems

825
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,040
or your accounts payable
systems, which are very exciting

826
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,163
because they involve real
people's lives and getting paid,

827
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,920
but that's a huge area for us to also pay

828
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,610
a great deal of attention too.

829
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,190
And that's really the nutshell of,

830
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,010
you look at the newsroom
very specifically,

831
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,223
and then the rest of the company at large.

832
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,770
So let's look at some hard
problems that we faced

833
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,850
that we can't really solve,

834
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,840
these are not things that
we're like one of many

835
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,840
who would desire these outcomes,

836
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,297
but these are really kind of
interesting hard problems.

837
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,060
And if you're looking for
a challenge out there,

838
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,260
please take a look at
my list of hard problems

839
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,500
and solve them for me,

840
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,840
and just produce the golden goose

841
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,593
because that would be awesome.

842
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,780
One of the things we run into all the time

843
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,640
on social media platforms
is a lack of clarity

844
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,760
and consistency in language

845
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,513
and presentation security controls.

846
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,240
Social media platforms
really seem to like to change

847
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,490
their security controls all the time,

848
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,790
change how they're referring to things,

849
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,750
even at the most basic manner.

850
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,490
So that when we say, hey, this
is what you do to do this,

851
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,290
and one of our people goes,

852
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,860
I don't see that button and we look at it

853
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,560
and we go, it was there yesterday.

854
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,710
If there was a system or a scheme where

855
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,580
the policy you would like as an individual

856
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:50,190
for your security controls
and privacy controls

857
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,170
could be read from a
file as opposed to like

858
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,450
clicked on a bunch of random

859
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,200
like boxes on five different
tabs, that would be great.

860
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,040
So if you have any influence
or control over this,

861
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,940
that would be wonderful.

862
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,700
I'd really like someone
to produce the holy grail

863
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,690
of telecommunications devices.

864
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,573
I need something about this big,

865
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,330
it does like multiple hundreds

866
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,203
of megs of bandwidth
reliably, runs on batteries,

867
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,800
so that when we send
journalists to natural disasters

868
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,020
or conflict areas

869
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,560
or just out into the
hinterlands of the world,

870
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,213
they have a way to return us
high-quality rich journalism.

871
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,870
We're not just a print org,

872
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,330
and more it's not just some
words we need to scream out,

873
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,380
we're not just dictating phone,

874
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,960
dictating stories over teletypes now.

875
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,540
We are trying to move up the scale

876
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,840
of the kind of media we're producing.

877
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,578
So that would be great if you can do that.

878
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:53,778
I'm not asking for much.

879
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,820
As we all know, when you
get a large gathering

880
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,800
of people together, a festival
or an event or a rally,

881
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,240
we often see modern telecommunications,

882
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,790
wireless telecommunications
kind of grind to a halt

883
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,450
or slow way down,

884
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,910
and then what happens is journalists

885
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,120
basically have to go to the event,

886
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,100
cover it as best they can,

887
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,530
and then get back to some
sort of usually a landline,

888
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,860
but sometimes just
outside of that cell area

889
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,443
to file their story and
provide some context for it.

890
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:31,120
So really what we're looking
for is something like

891
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,570
wireless mesh network,
something like Gotenna

892
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,980
or Meshtastic that can send
print ready photos or videos

893
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,823
as well as long bits of text,

894
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,300
that would be an amazing little tool

895
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,023
to help us get that working.

896
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,710
We'd love some tools that
allow for a lightweight mobile

897
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,240
opt-in mobile device management.

898
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,710
So we work with freelancers,

899
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:58,470
and their phones are their
phones, they're not our phones,

900
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,100
we're not gonna top down just like

901
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
start putting our policy on their phone.

902
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,830
So something that is, but we
could come up with some like

903
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,760
quick enrollment thing where we're like

904
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,310
under these circumstances,
what do you want us to do?

905
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,860
Da-da-da-da.

906
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,393
So that if they get detained
for whatever reason,

907
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:20,310
we can, A, know that they're detained

908
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:21,777
because we can track them physically

909
00:43:21,777 --> 00:43:24,103
and we're allowed to through their device,

910
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:27,973
or we can lock their phone for them.

911
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,260
In that same vein, remote
journalist check-in tools,

912
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,170
these generally don't work at scale

913
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,430
and we have a lot of journalists,

914
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,780
so we do a lot of check-ins.

915
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,950
So if there's a tool out there

916
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,500
that would allow basically
a way for journalists

917
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,490
to self-enroll for security check-in

918
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:49,060
and then check-in and they
would be able to report back,

919
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,040
and if the check-in didn't
work or they hit the red button

920
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,890
because the meeting is not going well,

921
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,690
and they really do need some backup,

922
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:00,920
that would be wonderful.

923
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,300
Tor network speeds, I love it

924
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,300
when a source comes to us and says, hey,

925
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,167
I've got six gigs of
data I wanna drop on you,

926
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:09,000
and we're like, yes, that's wonderful.

927
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,710
And then they say, over an OnionShare,

928
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,593
and I'm like, eh, uh-huh,

929
00:44:11,593 --> 00:44:14,110
because I know downloading
six gigs of data

930
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,323
over the Tor network is
really, really, really painful.

931
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,890
So anything you can do to help speed up

932
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:23,590
the Tor network speeds would be great.

933
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:26,820
Operating proper relays and
exit nodes is wonderful,

934
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,850
supporting them financially,

935
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:30,870
so they can hire more folks
to work on the project towards

936
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,660
currently working on increasing
their network speeds.

937
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,130
I'm really excited about that project

938
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,380
at many different levels.

939
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,120
Speaking of that six
gigs of data we just got,

940
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,953
it'd be really great

941
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:44,770
if we had a really wonderful set of tools

942
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,593
for source media sanitization.

943
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,740
We are looking at tools right now,

944
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,880
but it doesn't seem like
anyone makes a really great

945
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,290
robust method for
sanitizing masses of data

946
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,730
at scale in a newsroom,

947
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,150
especially with a lot of the controls

948
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,330
and features we would like
to see as a news organization

949
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,630
and not a financial organization

950
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,080
or an insurance organization.

951
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,580
Finally, we have all this data right,

952
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,430
better tools for searching

953
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,570
and analyzing large mixed files sets.

954
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,066
So you just get a lot of random
stuff in folders sometimes,

955
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:19,976
and you're like, okay,

956
00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:23,567
so there's folders of PDFs, interesting.

957
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,990
You can't just grep that,
maybe it's mixed set, right?

958
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,750
Maybe it could be a lot of different data.

959
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,640
So having a way to handle
that would be wonderful.

960
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,410
Finally, an external message handling tool

961
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,600
for secure messaging platforms.

962
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,100
When we start getting 10X
messages in our tip line

963
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,990
because of a campaign from a group

964
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,570
that would really like to be heard,

965
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,840
it makes it very difficult for us

966
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,183
to weed through all of that information.

967
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,090
So something that we could operate

968
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,800
that would allow us to
manage all those messages

969
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,420
in a secure way and do
some filtering and binning,

970
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,340
so we can really go, okay,
this is all from this,

971
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,200
but here's a unique tip
and here's a not unique tip

972
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,620
would be great, especially for apps like

973
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,323
WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram.

974
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,490
Again, not an easy thing,
but definitely worth doing,

975
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,610
especially we want these tools to be tools

976
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:23,113
for simple good.

977
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,420
Those are the hard problems.

978
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,090
Oh, and finally Bellingcat
has their own list of

979
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:31,010
OSINT projects that they're working on,

980
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,120
that are stalled GitHub stuffs.

981
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,030
Definitely check out Bellingcat's work

982
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,840
and their need for building tools

983
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,453
for open source investigators.

984
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:42,790
So maybe you wanna get involved,

985
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,490
maybe hopefully I've inspired you.

986
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:48,610
Please think about attending
the Internet Freedom Festival,

987
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,720
there possibly will be
some similar meetups

988
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,770
like that in the states in
the next couple of months,

989
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,170
so definitely stay on
the lookout for those.

990
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,860
Attend the journalist
convention if you feel like,

991
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,060
that's another great place to

992
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,403
like kind of get a flavor
for what's going on.

993
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,630
If you're looking for work,

994
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,600
check out the Digital Rights Job Board,

995
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,960
a lot of posts are put up there.

996
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,120
I post all The New York
Times jobs to that board

997
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,300
as they come up and there
are openings right now

998
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,050
at The Times in the security group.

999
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,990
We have major, I mean we're
not the only, we're not the...

1000
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,460
There are other newspapers out there,

1001
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,543
there are other news orgs, surprise.

1002
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,870
So definitely check out
The Wall Street Journal,

1003
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:30,930
Bloomberg, The Washington Post, CNN, BBC,

1004
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,583
Reuters, AP, Gannett.

1005
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:37,960
And also if you don't
wanna switch your job,

1006
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,450
but you just wanna try and
help your local newspaper,

1007
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,640
it's a really good idea.

1008
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,040
Local news is really,
really, really important,

1009
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,790
and it's really, really,
really on the ropes right now.

1010
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,810
So definitely think about checking in

1011
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:52,900
at your local newspaper,

1012
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,000
even if it's an alt weekly

1013
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,100
and ask if they want any help

1014
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,350
because they might, they
probably do need the help.

1015
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:02,400
And even if it's just advisement,

1016
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,900
it could lead to something you could not,

1017
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,350
but it could definitely help.

1018
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,106
If you are a researcher, if
you're like working NGOs,

1019
00:48:11,106 --> 00:48:13,100
you like doing advocacy,

1020
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,670
definitely check out some of
the NGOs working in this space.

1021
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,020
There's the committee
to protect journalists

1022
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,390
who help me get some of my stats.

1023
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,690
There's Reporters Sans Frontieres,

1024
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,980
they're a wonderful organization.

1025
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,810
The International Federation
of Journalists is out there

1026
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,483
working on behalf of
journalists internationally.

1027
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,870
The International Women's Media Foundation

1028
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,760
is another great place to look in that.

1029
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,030
The Freedom of the Press Foundation,

1030
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,410
a lot of folks I bet you in this very room

1031
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,023
are from that organization.

1032
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:45,280
So please think about
working for one of them

1033
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,113
or working with them.

1034
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:48,370
And there's a bunch
more, I didn't even name

1035
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,000
also working on these same issues.

1036
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,570
So hopefully you've found
this talk enlightening.

1037
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,284
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me,

1038
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:01,593
you can hit me up on
Twitter, my DMs are open.

1039
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,810
And I'm not a great
Twitter person by the way,

1040
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,030
but I will look up an eye out for you.

1041
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,810
So feel free to ask me
any questions you like.

1042
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,603
Thank you so much, and have a good day.
