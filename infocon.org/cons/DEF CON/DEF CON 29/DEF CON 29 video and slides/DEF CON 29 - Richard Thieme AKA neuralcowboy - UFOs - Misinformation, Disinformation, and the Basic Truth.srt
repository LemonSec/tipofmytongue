1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,990
- Hello again, this is Richard Thieme,

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,410
showing up 25 years after I showed up

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,030
to speak here at DEFCON for the first time

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,480
to address the topic UFOS:

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Misinformation, Disinformation,
and the Basic Truth.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,040
A lot has been happening
since I made a talk

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,380
about this subject eight years
ago, which is on YouTube,

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,620
and I'll refer to that subsequently,

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,800
but I want to say that reality,
as Philip K. Dick said,

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,410
will not go away just because
we refuse to believe in it.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,460
And what is happening right now is real.

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,330
In fact, it's been real for a long time.

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,810
So given all the hullabaloo about UAPs

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,350
as we now call them and
UFOs, what is happening?

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,260
Well for one thing, those
videos are happening.

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,180
And I'm not gonna show them to you again,

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,300
because you've seen them.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,390
They're widely available on the internet.

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,350
You've seen the tic-tacs
and you've seen the videos

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,970
from the 2004 Nimitz incident.

21
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,780
And you've probably seen that object

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,890
going in and out of the water

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,840
on its way from US territorial
waters toward Cuba.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,050
Those are all very interesting
and all over the web.

25
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,970
So those videos and what
they're getting people to say

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,900
and think about are happening.

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,690
And officials commented on
them positively in public,

28
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,650
which is a near first,
so that's happening too.

29
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,200
They're not making jokes
about little green men

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,203
or conspiracy theories, eh?

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,060
In addition, Luis Elizondo and
his narrative is happening,

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,250
and he's telling the world
that he left the UAP Task Force

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,440
so he could bring his
knowledge, his concerns,

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,700
into public debate.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,530
Now, this is where I would be
showing you my second slide,

36
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,930
which is a picture of Luis Elizondo.

37
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,170
And no matter what we did
and how many hours we spent,

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,170
we could not get slides to
insert themselves in this video

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,250
using the software we had to use.

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,260
So the slides that accompany
this will be available

41
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,400
on the DEFCON server as
well as at my website,

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,240
which is thiemeworks.com,

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,957
T-H-I-E-M-E-W-O-R-K-S.com.

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,593
And you can go there and see them.

45
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,710
Now I'll also send them to you by email

46
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,000
in PDF, PowerPoint or

47
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,170
Keynote if you like.

48
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,720
Now, what is Luis Elizondo saying?

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,880
Well, he said to me a couple of years ago

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,000
in a conversation that the
conversation about UAPs

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,370
used to be at the water cooler, low level,

52
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,550
and now it is happening
at the highest levels

53
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,383
of the Pentagon.

54
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,073
Neat.

55
00:02:57,073 --> 00:03:00,360
I can add that a former member
of the joint chiefs of staff

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,350
confirmed that UFOs are real

57
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,670
and have been observed and
documented for a long time.

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,070
Okay, so what's happening
is UFOs are real.

59
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,240
But those of us who have investigated this

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,240
seriously and robustly and
diligently and skeptically

61
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:22,550
have known that that's been
true for the last 70 years.

62
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,270
But this time, the authoritative
voice, if you will,

63
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,810
60 Minutes, The New York Times,
CNN, The Washington Post,

64
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,290
The New Yorker, several
senators, the head of NASA,

65
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,350
they all constitute the quote
unquote authoritative voice,

66
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,930
and instead of dismissing
or ridiculing the rest of us

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,410
for reporting what we know,

68
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,810
they confirmed that they are real.

69
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,810
So this CBS with 60
Minutes saying those things

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,940
is not Walter Cronkite's CBS decades ago,

71
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,930
half a century ago, when he debunked UFOs

72
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,820
as not worthy of investigation.

73
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,230
And that did happen to be
a time when the CIA and CBS

74
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,783
and many other major media
had secret contracts.

75
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,760
So what's happening is
that authoritative voice

76
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,210
is confirming that UFOs are real

77
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,863
and are a security threat.

78
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,260
In our book, "UFOs and
Government: A Historical Inquiry"

79
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,740
to which I'll refer again,

80
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,270
because it's the gold standard

81
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,580
for historical research into the subject,

82
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,050
and we document that
from the 40s to the 80s,

83
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,850
using their own words,

84
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,580
the government considered
UFOs a security threat

85
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,490
and investigated what they
might be on that basis.

86
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,810
So what else has been observed
according to Elizondo?

87
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,970
Well, that there have been
many more documented sightings

88
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,910
than the videos you have seen,

89
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,110
and than the 100 and some odd incidents

90
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,600
to which they refer.

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Many, many more documented
sightings over the past 70 years.

92
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,160
And he also affirmed that they enter

93
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,470
and leave the atmosphere
and travel with equal ease

94
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,393
whether in space or in
the air or underwater,

95
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,360
and that the propulsion system,

96
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
which we really shouldn't
call a propulsion system,

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,140
because it doesn't seem to propel,

98
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,820
it's a means of translation, as it were,

99
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,028
from one vector of space-time to another,

100
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:33,460
and the velocities they
achieve and their aerodynamics

101
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,560
are still pretty much beyond

102
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,010
our understanding and capabilities.

103
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,410
Although I believe, and that's
a belief, not a knowledge,

104
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,120
that we are doing and have
been doing everything we can

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,140
to learn how to do that.

106
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,370
Well often when you observe UFOs,

107
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,810
there's what we could call a warp snap.

108
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,540
They blur, they don't simply go fast,

109
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,520
they blur and go out of sight

110
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,440
or out of our space-time entirely

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,970
or into a different dimensional reality.

112
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,800
Or they could be going so fast
from one point to another,

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,510
without impacts of gravity,

114
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,280
that they can not be detected in motion

115
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,340
by the eye or sensors.

116
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,680
But our sensors are doing a
good job at detecting them

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,460
in other ways.

118
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,720
The only alternative explanation in 1948

119
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,160
was that they were extraterrestrial

120
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,420
if they weren't Russian
or they weren't ours.

121
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,260
Now we can add multi-dimensional
and time-travel,

122
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,240
which if I have time, I'll refer to

123
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,260
so you know what I mean.

124
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,070
So don't think of how things
fly in the atmosphere.

125
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,740
They don't fly, they don't
action-reaction propel

126
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,420
one way and move another.

127
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,570
They move in inexplicable
ways, and often pilots report

128
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,370
they seem to simply vanish.

129
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,010
They are right in front of them in the air

130
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,120
and simply disappear.

131
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,800
So if they're not ours and
they're not Russian or Chinese,

132
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,930
or from this planet, the
only other explanation,

133
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,690
however you frame it,
is they're off world.

134
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,480
Now you can call this report,

135
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,840
that last category other, if you like,

136
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,020
but we know what they mean, right?

137
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,360
Wink, wink.

138
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,803
Other, indeed.

139
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,950
So where are we?

140
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,280
We're back to the Twining memo.

141
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,490
And we are back to what we were
saying about this in public

142
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,180
in the early 1950s.

143
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,840
I'm gonna pause this and get a map

144
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,860
that is on one of the slides

145
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,423
and show it to you so
you can see what I mean.

146
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,580
Okay, I'm back.

147
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,580
And here is a map that was
in Look Magazine in 1952,

148
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,470
when there was a lot of activity going on

149
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,640
capturing everyone's attention.

150
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,770
What you're seeing is a
map of the United States

151
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,770
and those circles and names
are all of the military bases

152
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,403
where UFOs were reported
by the government.

153
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,640
Got it?

154
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,820
You can find this map in
more detail on the web

155
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,610
if you look up the article
Look Magazine 1952 UFOs

156
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,150
and see the entire article.

157
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,150
It's at a Jan Aldrich's
Project 1947 website.

158
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,760
So that's what was happening.

159
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,320
And the Twining memo to which
I referred was happening.

160
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,110
The Twining memo, if
you do not remember that

161
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,420
from your UFO studies,
was written in 1947,

162
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,930
and it was from Lieutenant
General Nathan Twining

163
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,490
to Brigadier General George Schulgen

164
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,010
about flying disks.

165
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,900
And he said, "The phenomenon
reported is something real.

166
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,160
It is not visionary or fictitious.

167
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,050
The reported operating characteristics,

168
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,450
such as extreme rates of climb,

169
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,380
maneuverability and action,

170
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,960
which must be considered evasive

171
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,310
when sighted by friendly
aircraft and radar,

172
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,430
this is all confirmed
by multiple witnesses."

173
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,670
That was 1947.

174
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,540
So that's happening too.

175
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,540
That what we said and knew
in 1947 is being said again

176
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,530
as if it is new,

177
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,383
because it is the authoritative
voice making the statement.

178
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,010
Now, one of our colleagues
and researchers,

179
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,360
Barry Greenwood, co-author
of "Clear Intent,"

180
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,750
which is the term the CIA used

181
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,150
to characterize UFOs prodding the defenses

182
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,210
at military sites on the northern tier,

183
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,790
he shared my surprise
that the glum responses

184
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,200
to the government report,

185
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,670
because there's some real gold there.

186
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,690
The report notes that
they're physical objects.

187
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,490
Back in the 1950s, if you
tried to look up flying saucer,

188
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,600
which was a phrase that didn't exist yet,

189
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,680
in the Reader's Guide to
Periodical Literature,

190
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,980
which documented all popular articles,

191
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,480
you didn't find flying saucer, UFO.

192
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,750
You found hoaxes and delusions.

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,800
Well, things have changed,

194
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,220
because the report
disclosed for the first time

195
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,350
that those unusual flight characteristics

196
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,420
to which Twining referred
all those years ago

197
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,230
have been documented by multiple sensors,

198
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,270
including radar,
infrared, electro-optical,

199
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,930
our weapons-seekers,
and of course, visual.

200
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,210
And the report confirmed that
they constitute a flight risk.

201
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,670
The report mentioned 11 near misses.

202
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,120
Although one of our
colleagues, Richard Haines,

203
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,100
has been gathering
accounts of such encounters

204
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,190
from commercial pilots
and military pilots,

205
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,150
and has amassed in his
catalog of some years ago,

206
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,563
more than 3,000 reports from them.

207
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,170
So the reports said far from
getting out of the business

208
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,910
of studying UFOs, which
they claim to have done

209
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,900
after the conduct committee report

210
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,140
and the end of Project
Blue Book theoretically,

211
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,040
the government has been
keenly interested in UFOs,

212
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,520
particularly when they're
poking around military bases.

213
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,380
And very soon after the
report was released,

214
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,280
Kathleen Hicks, Deputy
Secretary of Defense

215
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,230
issued a memo for senior
Pentagon leadership commanders

216
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,660
of combat and commands and defense agency

217
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,200
and DOD field activity directors

218
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,810
to institute synchronized collection,

219
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,140
reporting and analysis of UAP

220
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,970
to secure test and training rages,

221
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,420
and essentially to create
a new infrastructure

222
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,400
for this activity.

223
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,670
So that's some of what's happening now.

224
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,060
But isn't it interesting that

225
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,870
all these things are being reported,

226
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,120
including these latest videos

227
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,100
without any context at all?

228
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,410
No historical context.

229
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,710
But there is, as I am
saying, a historical context

230
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,490
and the researchers to whom
I have referred and others

231
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,450
have tirelessly documented for decades

232
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,210
a great deal of what that
historical context is,

233
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,510
and we use data that's
in the public domain.

234
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,560
Open source intelligence is
frequently much more helpful

235
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,390
than trying to ferret out
compartmented limited information.

236
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,200
So let's look at what is really happening.

237
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,960
Now, this is where I
would show you the slide

238
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,907
of the cover of our book,

239
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:35,510
"UFOs and Government:
A Historical Inquiry."

240
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,700
The main authors are
professor Michael Swords,

241
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,160
a professor of history,
and the former head

242
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,560
of the chemistry department
at AMD, a chip maker,

243
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,820
Robert Powell, who now heads up SCU,

244
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,990
which is a scientific organization

245
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,420
dedicated to really good
analysis of these current cases.

246
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,520
Well, our book had nearly 1,000 footnotes

247
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,730
and they all pointed
to government documents

248
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,000
and other primary sources

249
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,420
so we could tell the
story of those decades

250
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,100
in the government's own words.

251
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,550
I highly recommend it, of course,

252
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,320
as required reading to begin
to understand the context

253
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,960
of what is being released now
without any context at all

254
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,990
because it was long ago.

255
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,127
For example, J. Edgar Hoover said in 1947,

256
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:27,830
"The flying saucer situation
is not all imaginary.

257
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,750
Something is flying around."

258
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,893
And I've already quoted
from the Twining memos.

259
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,940
Well, there's a ton more.

260
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,460
I'm looking over here
to see what time it is.

261
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,290
And yup, okay, we're good.

262
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,180
There's a ton more of all that to adduce,

263
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,440
but let's go beyond the fact of UFOs,

264
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,580
the fact that they exist,

265
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,780
the fact that they've been documented

266
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,540
to just name some of the
documented impacts of UFOs.

267
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,950
Here are some of the
well-documented effects

268
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,710
of which we know within
a variety of contexts.

269
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,590
The emanation of
microwave energy from UAPs

270
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,661
has been adduced,

271
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:14,550
and UAPs have shown themselves capable of

272
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:18,990
stimulating colored
halos around themselves,

273
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,040
largely from the noble
gases in the atmosphere.

274
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,820
In other words, they ionize nitrogen,

275
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,890
and that causes the colors that are seen

276
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,560
in relationship to the speed they go,

277
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,540
which is determined by
the power that they use,

278
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,370
however they manufacture it.

279
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,170
So when they hover,
they're red or red-orange,

280
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,940
but as they accelerate,
they go through other colors

281
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,360
until they wind up going
through yellow-green

282
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,550
and all the way to white and blue-white,

283
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,470
and at the fastest speeds,

284
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,620
they are a very, very intense blue-white.

285
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,250
All of that relates very mathematically,

286
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,940
very directly to the
ionization of elements

287
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,563
in the atmosphere around them.

288
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,610
They have been documented to produce

289
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,010
a dazzling white plasma on their surfaces,

290
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,530
which is somewhat similar
to ball lightning.

291
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,550
They induce chemical
changes in their presence,

292
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,030
and they're detected as odors.

293
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,150
They have turned off numerous times

294
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,030
automobile headlights or engines

295
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:24,030
by increasing the resistance
of tungsten filaments.

296
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,010
In other words, we can do some science

297
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,850
with the effects that they produce.

298
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,200
They have stopped internal
combustion engines

299
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,730
by increasing the resistance
of the distributor points

300
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,010
and suppressing the current
in their primary windings.

301
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,060
They have precipitated
numerous times on planes

302
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,690
and on the ground wild
gyrations of compasses

303
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,570
and magnetic speedometers,

304
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,610
and rattling metallic roadsides,

305
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,497
which shake just like in the movie,

306
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:55,600
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind."

307
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,620
They have heated up automobile batteries

308
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,230
by directly absorbing energy in the acid.

309
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,200
And they have interfered
with radio and television

310
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
reception and transmission

311
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,770
by inducing extraneous
voltages in the coil

312
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,080
and the tuned circuit,

313
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,530
or restricting the emission of electrons

314
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,160
from tungsten cascodes.

315
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,270
They have disrupted
transmission of electrical power

316
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,600
by an induced operation
of isolation relays.

317
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,880
They have desiccated
small ponds and dry grass

318
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,470
and bushes in the ground

319
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,320
by resonant absorption of water molecules.

320
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,710
They have charred or calcined

321
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,990
grassroots, insects, wooden
objects at landing sites.

322
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,493
In other words, they leave burnt circles.

323
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,770
They have heated by
terminus highways in depth

324
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,530
and igniting volatized gases.

325
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,740
They've heated the human body
internally as microwaves do.

326
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,510
They've caused people
to feel electric shocks

327
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:58,510
and they have induced temporary
paralysis in witnesses.

328
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,840
Numerous reports all over
the world through time

329
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,220
of moving toward a landed
UFO or a hovering UFO,

330
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,230
and suddenly being unable to move,

331
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,223
being conscious, volitional,
but unable to move.

332
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,270
In addition, medical
experiments have shown

333
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,150
that when pulsed at low audio frequency,

334
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,770
the energy they emit was capable

335
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,320
of stimulating the auditory nerve directly

336
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
so that people have a sensation

337
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,730
of hearing a humming or buzzing sound.

338
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,920
Okay, that's the end of that list.

339
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,760
Those are the effects and
some of the causes of them,

340
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,100
of which we have known for a long time.

341
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,890
That is part of the context.

342
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,920
And then there were incidents long ago,

343
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,890
again, back to 1952.

344
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,657
I'm gonna read this one directly.

345
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,730
"At a distance of a 130 miles

346
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,670
to the northeast of Washington, DC,

347
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,730
three different army radar units

348
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,820
detected an object at 18,000 feet.

349
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,260
The signal was strong.

350
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,800
It remained stationary
on radar for 30 minutes

351
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,450
and then began to move.

352
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,840
By the time it reached the
edge of the radar scopes,

353
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,720
it was traveling over
1,000 miles per hour.

354
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,990
The report went all
the way to the Pentagon

355
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,440
and the order came back
that if another one came in,

356
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,010
fire on it.

357
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,090
After that first night,

358
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,610
we loaded our 99 millimeter
anti-aircraft guns,

359
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,840
a rather unusual thing to
do in a populated area,"

360
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,237
Washington DC, right?

361
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:30,500
"And we also scrambled F-94 jet fighters

362
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,693
from McGuire Air Force Base.

363
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,400
This was the time when
Major General John Sanford,

364
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,930
who was Chief of Air
Force Intelligence said,

365
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,620
'Credible people have
seen incredible things.'"

366
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,600
Well, my slides and a few other details

367
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,520
that you might want to
investigate on your own

368
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,520
are the RB-47 case and the Minot URL,

369
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,480
the Minot case as
illuminated by Tom Tulane,

370
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,500
another colleague, online.

371
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,190
The RB-47 bomber was
paced for hours by a UFO.

372
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,340
Aircraft and ground radar
and visual observation

373
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,500
confirmed the event.

374
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,170
You might find the details
and how an explorer

375
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,020
like Brad Sparks pursued the reality

376
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,580
behind the reported effects.

377
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,120
He wrote an article for the
wonderful "UFO Encyclopedia,"

378
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,680
the latest edition of
which by Jerome Clark

379
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,223
is just golden.

380
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,040
And you could see Brad Sparks' article

381
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,140
in the "UFO Encyclopedia,"

382
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,580
or you can go online
to www.minotb52ufo.com.

383
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,380
M-I-N-O-T-B-5-2-U-F-O.com

384
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,600
and see how Tom Tulane
has provided details

385
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,990
of the Minot intrusion at
the Minot Air Force Base,

386
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,040
including detailed interviews with pilots,

387
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,203
what they saw, what they said.

388
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,650
This is a good place to start,

389
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,380
or you can look at the
Loring Air Force Base case

390
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,703
from October of 1975.

391
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,440
FOIA listed 24 documents describing

392
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,720
a B-52 bomber crew on the ground,

393
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,130
observing an object 300 feet away

394
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,870
and five feet above the ground

395
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,030
at that military installation.

396
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,350
Or you can look at the document
we received from the DIA

397
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,550
by a FOIA request of the
incident of Tehran, Iran

398
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,930
in September of 1976,

399
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,920
which details a dog fight
between fighters and a UFO.

400
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,860
An Iranian general later spoke publicly

401
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,350
at a press conference,
confirming the event,

402
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,840
and the reports from the DIA says the case

403
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,990
is of the highest credibility.

404
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,350
I'm referring you all these cases because

405
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,070
that's where you have to go

406
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,350
if you want to know the
context and the depth

407
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,010
and the details of how this phenomenon

408
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,490
has manifested itself over so many years.

409
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,410
Cases, cases, cases.

410
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,930
Read them.

411
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,087
Mike Swords, our lead professor said,

412
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:09,220
"I believe no one can be
a good student of UFOlogy

413
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,120
unless one reads lots of cases.

414
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,380
Cases are all we've got.

415
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,140
Read them, read them, read them.

416
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,740
Some reasonable sense, not
all analytical, then follows."

417
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,217
And what he's suggesting
is as you peruse dozens,

418
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,020
then hundreds, then thousands of cases

419
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,220
from all over the world,
you begin to get a feel,

420
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,030
like reading a tape in
the stock market of old,

421
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:43,000
or following the dots
of any dynamic reality,

422
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,710
you get a feel for what is going on

423
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,860
on the basis of not just similarities,

424
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,830
but identical reports, of
affects and experiences

425
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,790
from all over the world.

426
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,230
You don't need 10,000 hours
of case reading to do that,

427
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,880
but you do need a lot of hours,

428
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,050
because there are so many cases,

429
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,820
and you begin to evaluate which ones

430
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,330
you don't even want to read.

431
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,780
You prefer two witnesses or more,

432
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,820
not single witness cases.

433
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,010
You don't worry about
lights in the sky, period,

434
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,880
as if that's all UFOs are.

435
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,730
Read the cases, read them,
read them, read them.

436
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,800
Now, one of the things that
happens during these encounters

437
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,540
is there's something
that we call strangeness,

438
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,267
because we don't know
what else to call it.

439
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,400
But people do report missing time,

440
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,040
which can be caused by a number of things

441
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,800
or finding yourself
becoming conscious and alert

442
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,540
far from where you had been
when the encounter began.

443
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,890
Or you were traveling a busy road,

444
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,650
there was sounds of traffic,

445
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,000
or there were outdoor nature
sounds, birds and insects,

446
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,710
and suddenly there's silence.

447
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,003
It's like being in a bell jar.

448
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,660
We don't know what's happening.

449
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,640
Is it a warping of space-time somehow?

450
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Or is it the impact of the
phenomena on human consciousness?

451
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,690
Because ultimately the
impact of all of this

452
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,420
on human consciousness,

453
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,800
individual as well as societal,

454
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,500
is where we have to go,

455
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,130
because that's how it comes home to us.

456
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,120
That's how it's important.

457
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,730
Are there patterns?

458
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,530
Well, you look for them,
but if there are patterns,

459
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,130
they seem designed to confuse us.

460
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,870
You can't say that's
clearly the intention,

461
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,570
or certainly the intention,

462
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,403
but they seem to act like
deception operations,

463
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,720
because we can't identify an easy pattern.

464
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,313
Except I think there's one
that is incontrovertible.

465
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,300
All of the intermittent reinforcement

466
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,540
of UFO encounters over the past years

467
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,410
has resulted in all of
us knowing about UFOs.

468
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,820
In other words, they were hoaxes
and delusions 70 years ago.

469
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,043
Now they're UAPs.

470
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:03,900
We all know how to draw a UFO.

471
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,670
Not all the UFOs look the same,

472
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,190
but you know what I mean.

473
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,360
You know what a classic UFO looks like.

474
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,940
A prolonged exposure to
intermittent reinforcement

475
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,176
from manifestations in remote places,

476
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:22,176
unusual places often and
impossible to predict places

477
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,110
has sensitized us to the fact

478
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,500
of their existence and presence

479
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,110
and has alerted us to the
possibility and expectation

480
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,970
of meaningful contact.

481
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,573
We don't call the men from Mars anymore.

482
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,750
So it's important to look at the cases.

483
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,430
It's important to grasp
what you can from them.

484
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,750
But it's important to understand that

485
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,600
if you haven't done some of the homework

486
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,780
and looked at the cases we have amassed,

487
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,130
go to Project 1947 website
that Jan Aldrich has done.

488
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,627
Look at the Project Blue Book website.

489
00:24:57,627 --> 00:25:01,600
Look at all the work that we have done,

490
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,500
over 50 years of gathering documents.

491
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,880
Barry Greenwood, to whom I referred,

492
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,100
I think the last time he counted

493
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,880
he had 250,000 clippings on UFOs.

494
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,870
It does help in this
domain as in many others

495
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,110
to be obsessive and compulsive,

496
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,210
because that produces results.

497
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,350
It's a feature, it's not a bug.

498
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,570
Well, are we the only ones concerned?

499
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,463
No, I don't think so.

500
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,120
China created the government-sponsored

501
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,710
China UFO Research Organization, or KIRO,

502
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,380
under their Academy of Social Sciences

503
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,470
to study UFOs or UAPs.

504
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,000
There is a People
Liberation Army Task Force

505
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,920
dedicated to unknown objects

506
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,820
that increasingly relies on AI technology

507
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,720
to analyze its data.

508
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,000
Of course we're not the
only one interested.

509
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,220
If there's a security implication,

510
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,977
and if whoever susses out
the sources of propulsion

511
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,890
and maneuverability gets
to it first, they own us.

512
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,590
They own the planet.

513
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,500
As indeed, whatever's
behind this phenomena

514
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,400
has made clear as Wernher von
Braun said many years ago.

515
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,560
Now we're up against something

516
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,430
that has far superior technology

517
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,420
to what we've thought.

518
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,220
Well, China in effect by creating
their own investigations,

519
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,250
as we know Russia has done
for a long time and others

520
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,000
as well, they're really kind of saying

521
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,580
what Jenny Randles tells us

522
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,660
Alan Heinick, the
astronomer associated with

523
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,460
Project Blue Book in the Air Force

524
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,140
consultant said when
he was at the Pentagon

525
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,327
and a general took him aside and said,

526
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:46,910
"Alan, do you really think we would ignore

527
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,020
something like this?"

528
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,740
Well, no, no.

529
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,700
We don't think they have ignored it.

530
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,570
And that's why we know this report

531
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,887
is just the tip of the iceberg.

532
00:26:56,887 --> 00:27:00,763
It's refers to 100 and
some odd events recently.

533
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,730
But knowing all that,

534
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,320
knowing them has had a powerful impact

535
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,750
on people over the years.

536
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,750
And it does impact how you
think it's right or best

537
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,980
to report out things that
originally were unthinkable.

538
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,570
Well now with the
authoritative voice speaking,

539
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,080
so the rest of us who have
been speaking for years

540
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,550
can be heard, it's not unthinkable.

541
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,190
It's more than thinkable.

542
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,313
It's knowing.

543
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,760
And some of the effects of knowing

544
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,570
something that can be so
impactful, so traumatic,

545
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,520
it can be a major
restructuring of how we think.

546
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,390
It can mean a majoring restructuring

547
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,750
of society hierarchically.

548
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,010
So that the pieces that we put together

549
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,230
into how we believe we ought to operate

550
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,973
will fundamentally change knowing we,

551
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,610
let's say it, are not alone,

552
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,030
and are not the top of the food chain.

553
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:03,003
Belief systems will stretch
to accommodate new data.

554
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,330
You know, the Roman Catholic Church said,

555
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,383
no problem if aliens are
real, we'll just baptize them.

556
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,493
That's a belief system stretching
to accommodate new data.

557
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,860
Or sometimes people double
down on their original beliefs.

558
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,900
You know that.

559
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,360
That the more something
is shown to be incorrect,

560
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,950
the more people assert it to be true.

561
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,923
The political situation
is testimony to that.

562
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,620
And when I've been giving speeches on this

563
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,570
or on intelligence matters,

564
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,070
or things that are a challenge for people,

565
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,480
I often hear someone say,

566
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,240
I don't want to know that.

567
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,580
I don't want to live in your world.

568
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,560
Well, that's a choice people make,

569
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,760
to hunker down in their bubble, play golf,

570
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,700
do whatever they do to distract themselves

571
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,423
from what's a little more
important than making par.

572
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,470
And I don't want to know that.

573
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,150
Well, I've heard that enough to know

574
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,950
that I do want to know it,

575
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,740
I'm a need-to-know machine
I'm a curiosity machine,

576
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,790
and curiosity is generally
considered to be a good,

577
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,330
and a sign of intelligence,

578
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,180
although when I was doing
a talk at Los Alamos

579
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,970
and I was asking questions
about their supercomputers,

580
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,340
the respondent who didn't say much said,

581
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,160
you know, curiosity is considered
a good thing elsewhere.

582
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,283
In here, it's not.

583
00:29:25,242 --> 00:29:27,120
In other words, shut up.

584
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, how is this impacting people?

585
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,370
Just ask Bill Nelson who's
now the head of NASA.

586
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,060
He said when he was serving in the Senate,

587
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,070
he saw classified UAP data.

588
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,120
Now keep in mind that
the report we've seen

589
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,990
is seven pages, and we are
told that there were 70 pages

590
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,330
and the rest was all classified.

591
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,900
So we don't know what was in there

592
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,900
other than that there were
more details and more reports.

593
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,680
Well, Nelson said when
he heard the reports,

594
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,610
quote, "The hair stood up
on the back of my neck."

595
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,430
He said he also spoke
with some of the pilots

596
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,567
involved in the incidents and he said,

597
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:10,187
"They know they saw something."

598
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,470
Well, the point of that
is when the head of NASA

599
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,690
and a Senator hears a classified briefing

600
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,170
and reports that the hair stood
up on the back of his neck,

601
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,500
it makes the hair stand up
on the back of our necks,

602
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,030
because it adds to the implications

603
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,730
of what we're discussing,

604
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,810
the unknowns of what he did hear,

605
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,436
and what we do know on top of

606
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:37,380
what we have been able to fathom.

607
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,520
So why would he say that?

608
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,870
What else is not being said?

609
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,700
How many classified pages of the report

610
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,613
were not put out into the public?

611
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,540
Well, we have hints right from
the senators who heard it.

612
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,373
Mark Warner,

613
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:55,518
the Chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee said

614
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:59,890
he was first briefed on
UAPs nearly three years ago,

615
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,850
long before 60 Minutes
did their little piece.

616
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,170
And since then he said the
frequencies of these incidents

617
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,360
only appears to be increasing.

618
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,530
Today's inconclusive report
is the beginning of efforts

619
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,100
to understand and
illuminate what is causing

620
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,710
these risks to aviation in
many areas around the country

621
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,810
and the world.

622
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,220
Marco Rubio, senator and Vice Chair

623
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,920
of the Intelligence Committee said

624
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,290
for years the men and women
we trust to defend our country

625
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,200
reported encounters with
unidentified aircraft

626
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,520
that had superior capabilities.

627
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,020
And for years, their
concerns were often ignored

628
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,853
and ridiculed.

629
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:42,550
This report is an important first step

630
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:46,163
to catalog these incidents,
but it is just a first step.

631
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,240
We have endured ridicule from
these authoritative voices

632
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,340
for decades.

633
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,057
I've said before, illusion,
misdirection, ridicule.

634
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,940
These are the three legs of the
stool of covering deception.

635
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,050
And they are used effectively by agencies

636
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,270
which have resources that are so extensive

637
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,563
that the normal human cannot imagine.

638
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,643
Ridicule.

639
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,560
Lawyers have whole seminars
in how to ridicule a witness

640
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,690
to completely undermine their credibility

641
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,070
so that nothing they subsequently say,

642
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,200
even though it's the truth, matters.

643
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,860
Those of us who have pursued
information about this

644
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,860
for all these years know
the effects of ridicule.

645
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,100
Well, what is the way forward?

646
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,300
What are we going to do?

647
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,563
Whether or not the military
pursues UFOs in earnest,

648
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,820
there has to be a civilian program.

649
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,580
The military from the first has focused

650
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,163
on the threat to security,

651
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,650
but a civilian program can do science.

652
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,950
Civilians, not just military, do science.

653
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,890
And what UFOs really are,
what they constitute,

654
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,460
remains a scientific problem.

655
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,170
It's not just a question of intelligence

656
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,240
or counter-intelligence.

657
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,240
We need a study well-designed
to develop a strategy,

658
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,400
to test our hypotheses about what they are

659
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,100
and distinguish among the different UAPs.

660
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,510
This comes from Mark Rodeghier,

661
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,910
who is the head of the CUFOS,

662
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,120
or the Center for UFO Studies.

663
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,020
Mark is a very bright guy,

664
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,310
and he has worked in that area for decades

665
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,180
and has shared the frustrations

666
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,430
of not seeing the science supported

667
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,680
that would enable us to do this.

668
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,180
I mentioned SCU, you can look it up.

669
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,470
Robert Powell, my colleague and coauthor

670
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,810
of "UFOs and Government."

671
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,570
They have done analyses
of recent incidents,

672
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,200
including the ones
we're talking about here

673
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,530
that are scientific, that
use teams of scientists,

674
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,830
and that only report out
in up to 200 page reports

675
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,520
of what they can verify
as scientifically feasible

676
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,060
and well documented.

677
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,570
They approach it as a scientific problem.

678
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,080
And this is in contrast
to how so many of the

679
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,080
cottage industry of UFOites
have pursued the problem,

680
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,730
which is by hearsay,
their own misinformation,

681
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,260
because they don't know
what they don't know,

682
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,810
or what they do know,

683
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,800
and their disinformation
sometimes sponsored

684
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,150
and intentionally designed.

685
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,270
So it has to be a
scientific problem for us

686
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,823
to address in scientific ways.

687
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,653
UFOs constitute an existential threat.

688
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,503
It could be a threat
to security in general.

689
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,910
The technology is something
we don't know how to do.

690
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,060
And you know the analogy
is you go back 200 years

691
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,040
and describe cities aglow
with electric light,

692
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,003
and you'll sound like an idiot.

693
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,230
The history of science is replete

694
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,110
with the resistance humans
mount against the truth

695
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,490
when it threatens their belief systems.

696
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,490
And a superior technology
like this invites disbelief

697
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,190
and rebuffing it by saying,
oh, that can't be true.

698
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,400
But any time I find myself
saying that can't be true,

699
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,170
I find it really pays to
explore a little more.

700
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,901
Don't forget that Richard Feynman said

701
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:48,520
"The keystone of advances in science

702
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,700
is a fact that is also anomalous,

703
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,980
because it contradicts the belief system

704
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,660
in which it doesn't fit."

705
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,100
It has to be both.

706
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,710
It has to be a fact.

707
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,380
It can't be a non-fact and
it has to be an anomaly.

708
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,330
It has to be something that doesn't fit,

709
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,320
because then it prompts the question,

710
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,060
well, if this is real, if this is true,

711
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,030
if this is a fact, where does it lead us?

712
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,180
What else must be true?

713
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,830
If these reports all these
years have been true,

714
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,750
what does it tell us about
covering deception operations?

715
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,500
What does it tell us about
how different government units

716
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,640
operate as we document in our book?

717
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,280
There's no one government.

718
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,300
There's multiple government sectors,

719
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,620
and they're often at odds with each other,

720
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,140
just as in the intelligence agencies,

721
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,430
the couple of dozen of them,

722
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,060
people are often pursuing a goal,

723
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,880
but also highly or very much at odds

724
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,940
with one another as well.

725
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,140
Now the security question is real,

726
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,910
because if one of our
terrestrial adversaries

727
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,983
figures it out first, we're toast, right?

728
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,480
We're toast.

729
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,510
Every major military advance
from stirrups, to bullets,

730
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,510
the guns, on and on has given
insurmountable advantage

731
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,770
to the one who got to it first.

732
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,330
It's an existential threat too

733
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,870
because it's a challenge
to our societal beliefs.

734
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,140
It's a challenge to our cultures.

735
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,190
And it's a challenge to our religions.

736
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,870
Our religions are extraordinarily
resilient as we know.

737
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,860
We continue to affirm religions formulated

738
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,870
in the scientific worldview
of 2,000 years ago

739
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:36,220
and successfully compartmentalize
what we choose to ignore

740
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,913
and what we choose to try
to continue to affirm.

741
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,290
But there does come a tilt.

742
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,630
There does come a turning point,

743
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:51,630
which is why church attendance
is so far down in America

744
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:57,020
where people listen to nonsense

745
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,460
and just can't stand it any longer.

746
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,850
I'm not saying that
religions are nonsensical.

747
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,750
I'm saying they become
the excuse to say things

748
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,070
which in the rest of your life
you know you don't believe,

749
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,540
and you don't act on those things you say

750
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,900
you act on your true beliefs.

751
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,680
Well, a challenge to those beliefs

752
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,590
and the challenge to those beliefs

753
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,200
all the way up to the
level of cultural linchpins

754
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,540
is a serious existential threat.

755
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,320
And then of course, there's the unknown.

756
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,000
How, how do we deal with the vast unknown

757
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,200
and realizing how tiny we are?

758
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,570
Our galactic cluster, billions of galaxies

759
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,940
with billions of planets in them.

760
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,693
We know the universe is teeming with life.

761
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,650
Easy to dismiss.

762
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,680
Oh, where are they then?

763
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,390
As if they should all be clamoring
for our attention, right?

764
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,130
Like I want my ant farm to pay attention

765
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,483
when I walk into the room.

766
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,283
It's not happening that
way for good reason.

767
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,180
We're not the top of the food chain,

768
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,690
and if we're the apple of God's eye,

769
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,420
we're discovering that
there are millions of apples

770
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,750
on those very big trees,

771
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,460
and if there's a God that
loves all his apples,

772
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,310
we're just one apple.

773
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,310
It's always a challenge
when we have siblings

774
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,980
and we find out our parents
love them too, right?

775
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,430
Or as much as they love us.

776
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,223
So what did make the hair on
the back of his neck stand up?

777
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,670
We want to know.

778
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,400
For him, it was a challenge and a shock.

779
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,600
I went through that myself years ago

780
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,810
when I first got into this domain

781
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,060
and began hearing credible reports

782
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,720
from fighter pilots,
people in intelligence,

783
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,260
people in the military,
and just plain people

784
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,110
who wanted to talk about
what they'd experienced,

785
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,750
but which the authoritative
voice had prevented

786
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,740
from speaking aloud lest
they be told they were drunk

787
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,760
or crazy or ridiculed in other ways.

788
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,830
The time for that kind of
nonsensical ridicule is over.

789
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,930
This domain has had
debunkers, not skeptics.

790
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,603
Those of us who pursued the truth of this

791
00:40:18,603 --> 00:40:20,980
have been skeptical in the extreme.

792
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,560
It's valuable in a
scientific consciousness.

793
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,500
Debunkers are people who,
like committed atheists

794
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,440
say no, no, no

795
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,280
the way committed believers
say yes, yes, yes.

796
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,190
They're just as committed to
no as a believer is to yes,

797
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,560
and just as foolishly
wedded to their commitment,

798
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,970
which is based on emotional grounds,

799
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,380
not on the rational grounds they put forth

800
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,940
as the reasons they
believe what they believe.

801
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,680
Where are the debunkers now,

802
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,290
when it's not us,
investigators on our own,

803
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,440
who are advocating for the
reality of the phenomena,

804
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,440
but the authoritative
voices at all levels?

805
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,610
Well, they're pretty quiet, aren't they?

806
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,101
Where are the city people like Shostak,

807
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:10,101
who's been debunking us with
superior smirking for years?

808
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,360
He's flailing about in the weeds

809
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,490
because he would have an
awful lot more to attack

810
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,660
than the strong men and
women said he has invented

811
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,380
in the pretense that their approach

812
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,893
to discovering extraterrestrial
life makes any sense at all.

813
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:33,500
Well, I guess I'm gonna wind it up here

814
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,320
by making a pitch for intelligence,

815
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,530
clarity, passion, commitment,

816
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,253
and a radical willingness to open yourself

817
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:46,630
to wherever the facts
and the truth may lead.

818
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,280
And today that's a difficult thing.

819
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,280
The last slide has a
picture of my latest book.

820
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,807
I got to pitch it, right?

821
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:55,250
"Mobius: A Memoir."

822
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,670
25 years of my experience

823
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,300
working with security and
intelligence professionals

824
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,690
has finally poured in
to a single narrative,

825
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,110
and it's a novel, because as I often say,

826
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,690
a deputy director at the
National Security Agency said,

827
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,800
you can't talk about what
we talk about with you.

828
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,890
You have to write fiction.

829
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,830
Fiction is the only way
you can now tell the truth.

830
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,220
He was right.

831
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,717
Well, 37 published short stories
and now two novels later,

832
00:42:24,717 --> 00:42:29,717
"Mobius: A Memoir" is
the most truth I can tell

833
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,570
in a narrative that's coherent, artful,

834
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,990
and includes that quarter century

835
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,030
of deep listening to my colleagues.

836
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,730
I encourage you to take a look at it,

837
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,090
and it will soon if it's not there now

838
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:50,960
be at the Internet Archive
as a borrowable download

839
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,730
in digital form one at
a time as the rules go,

840
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,980
but you can of course buy it in Kindle

841
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,380
or print at a very reasonable price.

842
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,360
Check out my website for it.

843
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,340
I'm gonna repeat that, https://,

844
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,440
which we don't have to say anymore.

845
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Thiemeworks, T-H-I-E-M-E-W-O-R-K-S.com

846
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,150
Once more, it has been
a terrific privilege

847
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:25,690
and a pleasure to be part of DEFCON

848
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,010
25 years after I first spoke here,

849
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:32,900
because this has been my home conference,

850
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,150
a place where I'd never
had to explain who I was

851
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,120
because we all get it.

852
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,400
We get who each other is straight up

853
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,323
and that's why we come back.

854
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,380
So thank you for the invitation.

855
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,450
Thank you for listening,

856
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:54,420
and thank you for being
committed to exploring the system

857
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,450
in all its complexity and intricacy

858
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,700
so that you can take it apart

859
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,193
and put it back together again
in a way that works better.

860
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,193
Thank you.
