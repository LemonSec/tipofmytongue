00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,803
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,380
And welcome to Punkspider and IOStation,

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,683
making a mess all over the internet.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,960
I am Jason Hopper,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,910
and I'm the Director
of Research at QOMPLX,

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,083
and I'm here with-

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,150
- I'm Alejandro Caceres.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,280
I'm the Director of Computer
Network Exploitation at QOMPLX.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,910
- Years ago, Alex invented or developed

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,710
a system called PunkSPIDER,

11
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,930
and I developed something
called IOStation.

12
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,940
They're both pretty cool tools,

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,860
and we've been dusting them off lately

14
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,460
and starting to find some really good ways

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,860
that we can work together.

16
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,210
And this talk is just kind
of about how they started,

17
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,700
you know, how they're going

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,513
and where they're gonna be soon.

19
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,830
- Yeah, so start off with
a little history lesson

20
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,880
on what the fuck is PunkSPIDER, right?

21
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,830
So PunkSPIDER was a distributed
math web application

22
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,460
fuzzing project run over a Hadoop cluster

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,860
and storage in a distributed backend.

24
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,640
Don't worry if you didn't
fully understand that

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,860
we'll be going through
what the fuck that means

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,623
in a few later slides.

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,060
It was based on some older technology.

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,620
You vaguely might remember
it as that showed anything

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,600
with some SQL injection or
some other vulnerabilities

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,020
about like websites or some shit,

31
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,550
that's usually how people remember it.

32
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,720
So if you remember something like that,

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,553
that was QOMPLX.

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,700
It was presented at ShmooCon on 2013,

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,210
and also at the psych guest appearance

36
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,713
at the DEFCON 2014 as well, so.

37
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,310
Still a long time ago
during this old release,

38
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,510
everything was MapReduced, right?

39
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,660
If you remember that time
of where big technology

40
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,860
was the big buzz word,

41
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,393
instead of fucking like
blockchain or whatever,

42
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,310
then you remember times
of big data, right?

43
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,210
And the real game changer there was that

44
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,220
we could now crunch data
in a distributed manner

45
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,670
that was not incredibly difficult, right?

46
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,860
So MapReduce was not the
most absolutely efficient way

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,670
to do distributed computing,

48
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,640
but it was absolutely one of the easiest

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,520
and one of the most well-documented ones.

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,550
Like you can follow simple tutorials

51
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,910
and get a pretty decent
cluster up and running.

52
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,870
So it was actually really cool,

53
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,170
and everything back then was MapReduce.

54
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,930
So now I'm gonna show you
my sick UI skills coming up.

55
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,753
Nobody get intimidated, you know.

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
This is the old PunkSPIDER,

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,070
as you can see, there is a lot of,

58
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,930
you know, just text,

59
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,870
but main thing I wanted to show you

60
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,760
is you would type in a URL.

61
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,270
You could also make that kind
of like wildcard URL, right?

62
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,650
So like Darknet, Gitstar, for example.

63
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,090
By the way, don't actually go to the site.

64
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,530
It used to be a stamp site,

65
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,890
might've been taken down
whatever two stamp ago.

66
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,960
And for those of you that
already have, you know, sorry,

67
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,680
but what do you see, right?

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,690
So you see that what's returned,

69
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,660
which is at the bottom bit there,

70
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,140
is a last date scan.

71
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,110
Of course, we wanna keep a records updated

72
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,080
and a number of web
application vulnerabilities

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,793
that were fuzzing and scanning for.

74
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,080
So obviously this is Blind
SQL injection, SQL injection,

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,640
cross-site scripting, path
traversal, blah, blah, blah,

76
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,070
other very serious vulnerabilities
in websites, right?

77
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,070
So what we'd love people
to do is in a very,

78
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,960
it's just an extremely open passion.

79
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,310
We had an open API,
open UI, and everything,

80
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,810
is you could search any
websites that you wanted

81
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,270
and get either aggregates statistics

82
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,430
on the vulnerability
state of, for example,

83
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,943
if we were to do like star.edu,

84
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:42,220
or just kind of do your own research,

85
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,390
do your own vulnerability research.

86
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,850
I believe by, you know,

87
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,190
by the time this project
sort of was shelved

88
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,880
for a little bit,

89
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,230
we had something like 3.4
million vulnerabilities

90
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,230
or something like that.

91
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,490
So it was pretty cool.

92
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,910
So now we're out with the old, right?

93
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,493
That was old chip, old technology,

94
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,340
great technology,

95
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,270
good stuff that inspired

96
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,060
a lot of the technology that's today,

97
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,810
but it was still old, right?

98
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,370
So now we're back,

99
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,600
we're full on developing

100
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,270
and it's the biggest change to the project

101
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,210
is that Hyperion Gray was bought

102
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,890
by a company called QOMPLX.

103
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,870
And QOMPLX has been really amazing

104
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,540
about giving us the time, resources,

105
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,130
money, backing,

106
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,660
legitimacy,

107
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,620
everything possible for us
to succeed in this project.

108
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,950
Meaning that really, this
thing is flying right now.

109
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,730
And I'll get into some of the numbers

110
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,180
and we'll get into some of the specifics

111
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,330
of what we're checking for
in PunkSPIDER right now.

112
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,940
But this thing is really flying.

113
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,870
It's got dedicated engineering time.

114
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,320
It's not going back down, put it that way,

115
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,550
and it's only gonna get better and better.

116
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,660
But anyway, that's
enough about PunkSPIDER,

117
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,630
Hopper here is gonna give you

118
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,350
some bit of backstory about IOStation.

119
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,350
- Yeah, so IOStation used
to be called Omnisense.

120
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,490
I apologize if I accidentally
say that in a sentence later,

121
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,650
but Sysadmins have similarly
never liked this program

122
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,250
or the system either.

123
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,130
It started pretty innocently, and sorry,

124
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,057
what it is is just a giant
collection of tools that generate

125
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:25,720
and aggregate data and make
that available to a user.

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,940
And it really did start
out quite innocently.

127
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,830
I was just coming into
the cybersecurity space

128
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,780
and I started learning
about just how crazy

129
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,360
the DNS system is.

130
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Like what you can do with it,

131
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,910
the way that it's exploited

132
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,620
and it's such a seemingly simple system,

133
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,090
but I couldn't believe
the, like the depth.

134
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,990
And I was, you know,

135
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,950
learning about DNS amplification
attacks and decided,

136
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,350
because the way that I learned things best

137
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,450
is by recreating the wheel,

138
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,260
that I would just write a
DNS server from scratch,

139
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,980
and I turned it into an
amplification sinkhole

140
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,750
and then started just getting
real interested in that.

141
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,610
So I was writing a blog post

142
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,100
and I wanted to say, there are, you know,

143
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,630
this many open recursive
DNS servers on the internet.

144
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,930
Recursive DNS server, of course,

145
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,810
being one that will answer
a query for any domain,

146
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,060
it'll go out and find
the answer up the tree.

147
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,893
And so I started,

148
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:11,870
I couldn't find that answer,

149
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,850
how many there were on the internet?

150
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,920
So I started writing a little
Python script to do the scan,

151
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,753
to find them.

152
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:19,160
And then, you know, I realized that,

153
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,740
although that sounds simple
and conceptually it's simple,

154
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,380
there really is a lot of
subtleties to actually

155
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,260
being able to do even
a simple scan at scale.

156
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,320
And, you know, and then,
and then, and then,

157
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,290
it's some giant deep rabbit hole.

158
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,623
And before I knew it,

159
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,200
you know, I had this big system.

160
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,330
It's made up of many different parts,

161
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,510
but the primary parts are port scanning.

162
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,570
It's scanning over 25 ports.

163
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,730
There's a lot of like custom
extractions that it's doing.

164
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,830
In addition to the obvious
stuff like banner grabbing

165
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,033
and service detection
and things like that.

166
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,923
On the Darkweb,

167
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,750
we're again doing port scanning,

168
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,030
we're trying to tease out any information

169
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,400
on additional onion sites
that might be hosted

170
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,233
on the same VM

171
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,270
or definitely any way that we can link it

172
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,010
to a surface IP address or
domain or something like that

173
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,870
to do any attribution
for sites that, you know,

174
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,273
should be taken down with
from law enforcement.

175
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,580
We're also, of course, crawling
all these websites as well.

176
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,540
So we're doing, you know,
Darkweb mentions for, you know,

177
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,220
corporate entities and names
of other things of interest.

178
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,800
And, you know, coming from
the pure cybersecurity space

179
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,633
when we joined QOMPLX.

180
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,760
QOMPLX is a cybersecurity company,

181
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,880
but they really focus in assessing risk

182
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,430
and transforming risk.

183
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,150
And so there's a bit of a mind shift

184
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,310
that had to happen on my part

185
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,270
where some things that are really good

186
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,330
for pure cybersecurity actually
don't inform risk that well,

187
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,360
and there are a lot of other tools

188
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,450
that you can use in its place.

189
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,090
So I've sort of been
working on the system,

190
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,660
but with that very much in mind.

191
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,930
So a lot of the new kind
of directions that I'm,

192
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,763
or the new tooling

193
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,020
or the new things that I'm interested in

194
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,190
really are kind of going
down that namespace,

195
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,940
and that can be simple things
or seemingly simple things

196
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,660
like even just identifying
what a corporation has.

197
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,570
Like what are their assets?

198
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,680
Where are they?

199
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,810
Some corporations, honestly,

200
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,310
can't even answer that question for you.

201
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,140
And so doing this in a kind
of broad autonomous fashion

202
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,610
is really interesting.

203
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,450
How that informs other
sort of risk metrics

204
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,120
and then looking at
kind of proxy measures,

205
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,050
like what jobs are they hiring?

206
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,810
What technologies do they
have in those job ads?

207
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,260
Like how does that
potentially inform, you know,

208
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,440
what they're doing in-house?

209
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,040
We also have some passive sensors,

210
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,130
so I'll call them, you know,

211
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,900
we're monitoring the global
certificate transparency logs.

212
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,530
So pretty well, any SSL
certificate that's generated,

213
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,710
we record a copy of in near real-time.

214
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,660
And then we also have another
significant component,

215
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,870
which is our listening network.

216
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,730
So they're basically these
low interaction honeypots

217
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,060
that are distributed globally

218
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,270
and all across the IPv4 spectrum.

219
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,500
And they're out there sort
of just, you know, listening.

220
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,310
They then can identify the early onset

221
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,510
of any sort of broad malicious activity

222
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,500
or benign activity for that matter.

223
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,420
And we can use that as a
way to profile the threat

224
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,630
in like a socklog, for example, you know,

225
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,410
socks have a lot to deal with.

226
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,990
They don't need to be chasing
down leads that ended up

227
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,220
just being like Google crawlers

228
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,203
or the university of, you
know, whatever doing research.

229
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,370
Similarly, we can use this
to inform a risk score

230
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,290
by looking at for any given corporation.

231
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,000
If we know what our assets are,

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,610
have any of them been involved in say,

233
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,800
being part of a botnet?

234
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,070
And if so, for how long?

235
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,940
Like, you know, getting popped,

236
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,830
you know, once last year is one thing.

237
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,150
Getting popped and then
remaining part of botnet

238
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,100
or whatever for six months
is kind of something else,

239
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,070
that sort of speaks to their detection

240
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,860
and remediation policies.

241
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,020
Of course, I still have the
amplification attack sinkhole.

242
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,720
It's not the most
particularly valuable sensor,

243
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,038
but you know, it's an oldie and a goodie.

244
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:38,010
And then you know, honestly,

245
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,690
I started learning that if you

246
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,170
just start registering with places

247
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,630
and then looking under some rocks,

248
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,280
there's some really good data
that you can get for free.

249
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,260
I mean, Aaron and who is, sorry,

250
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,860
Aaron and Ayana, you know,
can provide lots of data.

251
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,450
So I collect WHOIS data on IP addresses,

252
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,700
which gives you ASN information,
organization details,

253
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,220
and point of contacts.

254
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,380
I do get domain who is,

255
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,660
but that's such a low value signal.

256
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,330
It's almost not worth mentioning.

257
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,180
One of the ways that Alex and
I are collaborating right now

258
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,080
actually is on doing some malware analysis

259
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,900
that we capture in our network.

260
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,800
So that would be, you know,
just doing fingerprints,

261
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,860
looking for what sort of network
behavior might be going on,

262
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,690
and trying to integrate that
with some of the other tools

263
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,220
to get a more broad picture
of what's really going on

264
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,060
in the internet.

265
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,050
And then I also record all information

266
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,840
from the DNS root zone
files for, you know,

267
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,170
like a thousand top level domains,

268
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,890
basically, anything
that's not a country code.

269
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,530
And that can be really interesting

270
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,860
just to identify suspicious
domains as they pop up.

271
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,590
They might be used as like a C2 server

272
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,500
or fishing or something like that.

273
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,820
But then it also can be used

274
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,163
in actually identifying
assets of a company.

275
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,010
The other thing I forgot
to mention is, you know,

276
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,270
in terms of proxy metrics
for the corporations,

277
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,410
you can also do things like
look at their SEC filings

278
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,810
and try to evaluate, you know,

279
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,210
for a company of this
size in this industry,

280
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,780
is their funding in
cybersecurity sufficient?

281
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,330
And lastly, you know,

282
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,420
no cybersecurity tool is complete

283
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,521
if you're not pulling in some GeoIP data.

284
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:02,120
(laughs)

285
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,760
So this has been a big
undertaking for a lot of years.

286
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
And so I started of small,

287
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,020
but I needed to rent
some servers and things.

288
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,260
And I figured I was more
interested in spending money

289
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,710
on something that I can hold in my hand

290
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,730
and have forever for a long time.

291
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,180
So instead of buying a
lot of cloud services,

292
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,380
I actually convinced my wife to allow me

293
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,350
to build a small
datacenter in the basement

294
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,070
when we were redoing the basement anyway.

295
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,720
And so the middle picture here

296
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,810
is sort of the first version of that,

297
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,330
where I've got a whole
bunch of old desktops

298
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,730
and I bought a few used Dell R710,

299
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,963
which bang for your buck
are awesome little machines.

300
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:39,120
They're real little workhorses.

301
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,070
And I had to become an
inner service provider,

302
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,903
which meant, you know,

303
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:42,810
registering with the government

304
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,870
and applying for a license.

305
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,850
I've got a BITS license,

306
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,440
which is basic internet
telecom services license,

307
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,300
which means I can actually
sell internet to my neighbors,

308
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,320
which is funny.

309
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,700
Although, you know,

310
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,560
there's not really much
good reason to do so.

311
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,163
It's not exactly cost-effective,

312
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,650
but I have used some cloud services.

313
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,270
So I've done a lot of scanning
for years using Linode.

314
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,480
And Linode has always been
really, really supportive.

315
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,410
They, you know, have asked me to abide

316
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,870
by a number of very reasonable guidelines

317
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,460
and otherwise they provide
me a lot of cover for

318
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,440
the very large number of abuse complaints

319
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,970
that I bring their way,

320
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,850
which is really awesome.

321
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,100
So, you know, if by chance
anyone from Linode is out there,

322
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,710
the trust and safety team in particular,

323
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,770
who I feel like I'm on
a first name basis with,

324
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,756
thank you very much.

325
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:28,820
(laughs)

326
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,643
- And you know, one thing
I'd like to say about this

327
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:36,643
is that I had the lovely
opportunity of seeing this project

328
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,116
from kind of beginning to end.

329
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:43,129
Not like there, I don't live
with Jason and his wife.

330
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:43,962
(laughs)

331
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:47,477
But I got to, you know, hear about like,

332
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:50,300
"Hey, I'm thinking of
building a datacenter,"

333
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,010
all the way, you know,
to that middle picture,

334
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,210
which by the way, just to point out,

335
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,670
Jason is a woodworker,
metalworker, astronomer,

336
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,503
blah, blah, blah.

337
00:12:58,503 --> 00:13:00,190
He does fucking everything

338
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,690
and he's good at it too.

339
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,770
So he built his own little
server rack right there.

340
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,290
And you saw that once he surpassed that

341
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,830
he bought a big fucking server rack.

342
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,400
So that's just fucking Jason.

343
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,675
He's crazy.
- It's true.

344
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,200
- I just want to point
out how insane it is

345
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,430
that, you know, he literally built

346
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,240
an internet service
provider in his basement

347
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,950
and he's like, "Yeah, no big deal."

348
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,783
- Just a Saturday.

349
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:23,260
- So anything, that's all.

350
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,093
- No, it's true.

351
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:25,190
I was quite proud of
that little server rack.

352
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,730
You know, I use pocket
holes and everything,

353
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,660
you know, it was fun.

354
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,910
But you know, Alex, we've been
talking a big game here, man.

355
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,230
What do you say we put our
websites where our mouth is?

356
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,403
I don't know, that's a terrible joke.

357
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:38,236
(laughs)

358
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:39,440
- Sure, no, I like it.

359
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,470
Let's put our websites where our mouth is.

360
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,410
- All right, so-
(laughs)

361
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,830
So you know, a little preface on this one.

362
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,510
So we do have a user interface
that has been revamped

363
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,130
since the one that Alex has shown.

364
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,210
However, it is not released yet,

365
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,440
and we are releasing a UI
in the fall of this year.

366
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,280
This is just our sort of
internal alpha use version only.

367
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,730
Functionally, I'm sure
it bears some semblance

368
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,210
to what we will end up releasing,

369
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,043
but the one in the fall

370
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:12,070
is going to be much, much
nicer than this even.

371
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,483
So, you know, this is PunkSPIDER.

372
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,680
No good search engine is complete

373
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,100
without a giant search bar.

374
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,110
So up at the top here,

375
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,390
I'm just gonna pick like a random domain,

376
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,880
something that I don't know,

377
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,190
may or may not be a little bit popular

378
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,490
and do a little search.

379
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,880
And you can see that this
kind of tumbler.com website

380
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,050
had no vulnerabilities,

381
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,530
but you know, there
actually is this one called

382
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,080
kickstarter.com,

383
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,470
which just so happens to have,

384
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,740
I see here a cross-site
scripting vulnerability.

385
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,680
So we display that,

386
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,270
we show the parameter that
we're using to abuse this.

387
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,340
And then we've got these
handy-dandy buttons,

388
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,770
which you can click to
test the vulnerability,

389
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,700
which will actually open up
this webpage with payload

390
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,860
and show you that it
actually is, it is working.

391
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,740
And then you can also copy a cURL command,

392
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,573
which is kind of handy.

393
00:14:57,573 --> 00:15:00,470
If you want to, you know,
change the text or do whatever.

394
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,020
We also have this like fairly complex way

395
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,440
of scoring these websites.

396
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,750
So our thinking is that any
one of the vulnerabilities

397
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,600
that we're testing for

398
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,530
are just insane to have
on a website modern times.

399
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,360
You know, there's no excuse for it,

400
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,680
which means that if you have

401
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,010
even one cross-site
scripting vulnerability,

402
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,240
your security posture basically
is a giant dumpster fire.

403
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,490
So we, I think very appropriately

404
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,300
rank these websites on the scale

405
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,203
of one to five dumpster fires.

406
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,483
And that's what this,

407
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:31,680
you can kind of see it is here.

408
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,090
So another kind of cool thing is

409
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,360
a way that we've already
started to kind of work together

410
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
between the two projects
is port scan data.

411
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,580
So this is kind of an easy
lift all things considered,

412
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,920
but you can click on ports

413
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,753
and see that, you know,

414
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,370
this one, for example, is running,

415
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,210
it looks like a mail server
and an open SSH server.

416
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,460
And so we're starting to kind of bring

417
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,470
these datasets together

418
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,980
and start answering
some communal questions.

419
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,390
But at the end of the day,

420
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,150
what we want this to be
is just a giant database

421
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,110
that users can search.

422
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,370
You can look at your own domains.

423
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,740
You can check the domains
that you visit or frequent.

424
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,380
We want this to be a really
awesome security tool

425
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,710
for the masses.

426
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,720
And there are a few limits

427
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,400
that we've had to walk a fine line on.

428
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,810
Of course, we don't
want people coming here

429
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,210
to just rip off the
database and go do whatever,

430
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,010
but we'll kind of circle back to that,

431
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,350
but yeah, did you have
anything to add, Alex?

432
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,225
- No, no, that was an excellent overview

433
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:21,820
of our user interface.

434
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,630
You'll see the little
country codes, of course,

435
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,679
which as Jason mentioned,

436
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,500
are essential to any security tool.

437
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,740
- Absolutely.
(laughs)

438
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,237
So, you know, Alex, it's funny,

439
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:33,550
before this talk,

440
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,680
I was actually on this
website called archive.org,

441
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,470
which I know is really, really popular.

442
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,420
And this new browser extension I've got,

443
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,250
has this like this eight on it,

444
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,580
and it's trying to tell me something.

445
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,610
Do you know anything about that?

446
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,686
- I don't.

447
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:46,542
(laughs)
- You don't.

448
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,550
- Oh, I'm just kidding. (laughs)

449
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,280
- I clearly knew them, but.

450
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,110
Yeah, so what we really wanted to do here

451
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,210
is PunkSPIDER has a few goals,

452
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,610
and we're gonna talk about
them a little bit later.

453
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,270
But one really big goal that we have

454
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,070
is that we wanna engage not only with

455
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,100
the security community.

456
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,570
I know we're speaking at DEFCON,

457
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,980
and you're probably with
the security community.

458
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,050
But I think it's really important that

459
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,080
we release our stuff out there

460
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,260
so that it's ingestible
by normal humans, right?

461
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,283
So if you look at the browser plugin,

462
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,660
it's really simple.

463
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,090
You may have already guessed this.

464
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,623
There are several
vulnerabilities on archive.org.

465
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,760
It has one dumpster fire rating,

466
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,450
which I believe is appropriate

467
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,210
for the number of vulnerabilities found

468
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,640
and types of vulnerabilities found.

469
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,830
And probably the most important
part of this plugin frankly,

470
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,560
is just that big red spider, right?

471
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,707
So that red button just tells you,

472
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:47,380
"Hey, this one site is dangerous."

473
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,900
So anybody that knows
something about web security

474
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,930
doesn't know anything about web security,

475
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,320
et cetera, whatever.

476
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,670
Anybody can really use this.

477
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,290
One other really cool
feature of this plugin

478
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,300
is the trip report.

479
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,040
So at the very bottom right of the plugin,

480
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,340
you can see it says trip report,

481
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,930
and if you click on that.

482
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,100
We've only gone to some sites
with cross-site scripting

483
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,933
right now.

484
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:13,370
So, you know, the results
are kind of obvious

485
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,107
in terms of what they do,

486
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,970
but all we're doing is
we're taking basic types

487
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,620
of extremely serious web
application vulnerabilities

488
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,720
and giving you a rolled up kind of view

489
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,653
in my last browsing session.

490
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,590
How many websites did I visit
that were vulnerable, right?

491
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,020
So that's something that
you might wanna know.

492
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,510
You might wanna say like, "Oh, shit!

493
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,200
Okay, you know, I've
been browsing for a week

494
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,080
and I have like 1% vulnerable.

495
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,470
I wanna go back and see who that was

496
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,120
and determine if I want to give them

497
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,150
more information, right?"

498
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,440
Like extremely important
for you to know that.

499
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,650
So that's what we wanted to do
with this browser extension.

500
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,570
It's also got this
little like reset button

501
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,403
that you can press,

502
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,940
that reset your stats.

503
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,410
And one particularly important thing,

504
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,940
Jason, if you could just go
to like any random website,

505
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,140
I don't like Google
'cause it's pretty good,

506
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,580
and open up the extension for me.

507
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,413
- Yep.

508
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,193
- You can see that it's grayed out, right?

509
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:19,710
That means that PunkSPIDER

510
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,973
doesn't currently have any data on it,

511
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,887
or is it, I'm sorry, Jason.

512
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:25,720
(faintly speaking)

513
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,890
- Yeah, I went to Google,
so it's been scanned.

514
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,723
Yeah, I know it's green.

515
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:29,980
It's it's been scanned.

516
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,240
- Oh, fuck me, it's green, okay.

517
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,280
So Google has been scanned.

518
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,790
So it's gonna tell you
if you're clean as well.

519
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:40,430
Another state of this
particular plugin is gray,

520
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,600
which means that we haven't scanned it.

521
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,830
If it is gray,

522
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,860
then you have the option
to submit it for scan.

523
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,990
The scan is really, really, really fast.

524
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,590
Like I've never seen it take more than

525
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,423
like three or four minutes.

526
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,360
So that's currently the plugin.

527
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,820
I wanted to show that with a
major website like archive.org,

528
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,349
because most of you have
probably heard of it

529
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,530
and it's a very off use website,

530
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,380
but we can move on to the next.

531
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,213
- Yeah.

532
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:07,190
So just to illustrate
the vulnerability here,

533
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,600
I'll hit reset,

534
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,150
and you can see it executing the payload,

535
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,500
printing out the message
that we've programmed.

536
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,383
- Yeah.

537
00:20:14,383 --> 00:20:15,810
Which is totally elite.

538
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,833
- Yep, total elite.

539
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,710
- All right, cool.

540
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,302
Let's move on to the next one.

541
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,135
- LendingTree.

542
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:21,968
All right, go for it.

543
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,930
- All right, so these
fucking LendingTree people.

544
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,003
Okay, so LendingTree, right?

545
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,741
What can I say about them?

546
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:32,560
Okay, I contacted them on Twitter

547
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,370
about what I described to them
as a horrible vulnerability

548
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,843
that is very obvious in your website,

549
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,513
and I did not receive an answer.

550
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,660
I could give you a whole rant

551
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,170
on my views on the fucking
responsible disclosure,

552
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,313
but I'm gonna save it.

553
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,130
And just say that as you can obviously see

554
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,920
from Jason loading the page

555
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,950
is that, you know, this payload
is executed seven times.

556
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,973
There's absolutely no
filtering going on here,

557
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,920
and you can also see that
it's just in a basic bitch,

558
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,670
basic ask query parameter there, right?

559
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,360
And that payload is not very complicated.

560
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,170
That's like the cross-site
scripting payload basically,

561
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,713
with like one thing at it.

562
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,560
So there's really no excuse.

563
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,293
We contacted LendingTree.

564
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,760
Let's see, a journalist
contacted LendingTree,

565
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,890
I contacted, no, I did yeah.

566
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,960
So two people contacted LendingTree,

567
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,100
this was over a month ago

568
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,600
and we still have received
absolutely no response.

569
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,080
That to me, it's just egregious.

570
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,900
We are not checking for
really super complex

571
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,210
second order blind SQL injections

572
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,740
to get a fucking out of band shell.

573
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,160
We're giving really basic
bitch perimeter injection here

574
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,980
and just getting it right back.

575
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,170
So any simple website scanner,

576
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,590
whether it be opensource paid, whatever,

577
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,790
should really be able to catch this.

578
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,380
Hell, you should be able
to catch this shit manually

579
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,680
if you're building this website.

580
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,540
So it's really a kind of inexcusable one,

581
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,570
and because it's a popular website,

582
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,910
I felt like I'd go
ahead and call them out.

583
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,850
Also, well, yeah, I won't
pick on them anymore,

584
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,683
but-
- Yeah.

585
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:22,900
- That's all I have to
say about LendingTree.

586
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,733
- It's funny too.

587
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:24,990
You know, people complain about,

588
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,220
you know, you get a pen test team,

589
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,200
that's not all that good.

590
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,917
And all they do is run automated tools

591
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,000
but they're cheaper or whatever.

592
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,880
Like when we're talking
about cross-site scripting

593
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
and a lot of these vulnerabilities,

594
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,380
like those would still
expose these problems.

595
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,930
So these companies are
not even doing that.

596
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,270
- Yeah, yeah.

597
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,470
And I mean, if you include,

598
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,930
even including like time
of like an engineer,

599
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,740
like that's like 10 minutes, you know.

600
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,220
Like it's not a significant
cost either, like so anyway.

601
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,069
Moving on.

602
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:54,902
My pleasure.

603
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:55,767
- All right, we're gonna
move through the next ones.

604
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:58,180
I think a little bit faster
here, but that's okay.

605
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,310
This is a good one.

606
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,143
- All right.

607
00:23:00,143 --> 00:23:00,976
Not a problem, bud.

608
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:02,610
This is tapas.io.

609
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,970
It is a mango website,

610
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,300
not about delicious, delicious tacos,

611
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,480
but that's okay, right?

612
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,650
So as you might've guessed here,

613
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,840
if you click on the plugin

614
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,850
or where to check Tom spider, whatever,

615
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,530
you can see that it's red,

616
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,363
it has a vulnerability,

617
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,850
and then it's cross-site
scripting vulnerability.

618
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,310
I know that you didn't
see an alert box pop up,

619
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,760
but let's go through
this website real quick

620
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,480
and we'll see what it has to say, right?

621
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,820
So pretty basic login page, username,

622
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,106
password, login, remember me, et cetera.

623
00:23:34,106 --> 00:23:34,939
Okay.

624
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:35,772
That's fine, right?

625
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:37,730
So Jason, if you could just
scroll all the way down

626
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,193
to page four, please.
- Sure.

627
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,193
Oh, holy cow.

628
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:44,270
There's like this whole other login form

629
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,210
almost completely by the footer.

630
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,043
What's that?

631
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,230
- Yeah.

632
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,370
So this is the real login
form for the web page.

633
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,473
Thanks for the lead in, bud.

634
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:58,180
But this is the real login
page for the website, right?

635
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,200
So what all I've done is,

636
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,620
because most cross-site scripting

637
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,610
also has HTML injection
vulnerability in it.

638
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,250
We just push it down with
a bunch of BR tags, right?

639
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,540
So like line break tags.

640
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,210
I pushed the real logging all the way down

641
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,210
and created a fake login up at the top.

642
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,530
So what does that allow me to do?

643
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,010
That means that I can grab that link

644
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,650
that's in the little bar right there,

645
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,996
send it to everybody that I know

646
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,530
and it gives us tapas.io.

647
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,360
Whether that be from a Twitter
search or LinkedIn search,

648
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,560
whatever search,

649
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,713
and it's something that they
inherently trust, right?

650
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,090
So now I can just sit back there,

651
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,620
obvious user names and passwords.

652
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,390
I know there's still like some crosswords

653
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,220
and restrictions that we
need to kind of get around.

654
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,680
This isn't a web app hacking talk,

655
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,230
so I won't open up through those.

656
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,120
But this is very easy to
just start filling usernames

657
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,130
and passwords is my point.

658
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,510
And that sucks.

659
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,697
So to anybody that says that
reflected cross-site scripting

660
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:57,893
is not that serious.

661
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,170
You're wrong.

662
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,328
- This is why they're wrong.

663
00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:04,150
(laughs)

664
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:04,983
Yeah.

665
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,670
So, you know, our tests aren't looking

666
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,890
just for cross-site scripting,

667
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,000
although there are many of those.

668
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,110
We're also doing SQL injection,

669
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,980
as Alex has said before.

670
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,180
So this is an example of this.

671
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,240
So primeinvestor.in, you know,

672
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,270
presumably something to do with finances.

673
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,500
They've got a login page.

674
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,290
They might have pretty sensitive
information behind this,

675
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,170
and they're not sanitizing their inputs.

676
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,810
So we were able to have the
web server execute SQL query

677
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,840
just by putting it into like a text form

678
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,310
or something like that.

679
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,030
It's also kind of
interesting that it can also,

680
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,910
even the error can give
you back more information.

681
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,890
Like this is clearly a WordPress site,

682
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,860
but this is crazy.

683
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,893
I mean, you know,

684
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,810
all they're doing is not
sanitizing their input.

685
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,450
I mean, most frameworks nowadays

686
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,860
won't let you avoid it.

687
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,130
I mean, this has gotta be like,

688
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,780
you almost have to go
to your way to have this

689
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,870
still be a problem.

690
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,920
And it's a huge problem
because this is being executed

691
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,890
with the same permissions
as the web server itself.

692
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,310
And so the web server must
have read-write permissions

693
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,510
on all the tables related to
users and things like that.

694
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,210
A website that has this kind of problem.

695
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,470
It wouldn't surprise me in
the bit in the slightest,

696
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,820
if they had plain text passwords

697
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,700
being stored in the database.

698
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,247
So potentially, they could
just dump this whole thing.

699
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:13,330
At the very least, they're
probably not insulting them

700
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,163
or whatever,

701
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:15,900
and you could just, you know,
unhash them or something.

702
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,390
But this is a massive problem, really.

703
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,870
I mean, this is, yeah.

704
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,703
I think you have,

705
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,470
do you have more to say on that, Alex?

706
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,203
- I do.

707
00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:27,410
You know, we think of sites like this,

708
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,410
like primeinvestor.in as
not a huge deal, right?

709
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,020
I mean, whatever.

710
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,230
You found some SQL injection.

711
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,263
Good job, right?

712
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,210
The problem with that
is that we can no longer

713
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,890
rely on that argument, right?

714
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,800
So we are in the age of data breaches.

715
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,800
We're to a point where data
breaches are so prevalent that,

716
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:54,320
you know, you have tens of
trillions of records sometimes

717
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,820
and leak aggregators.

718
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,820
Meaning that every breach
whether it affects you directly,

719
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,590
or whether it's a website
that you actually care,

720
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,670
whether the username

721
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,720
and password that you use on that website

722
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,853
was sensitive or not,

723
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,710
like it can still affect you, right?

724
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,980
So once I set up nothing to do with you

725
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,440
are now seriously affecting
the security of corporations

726
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,360
and people in general, right?

727
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,960
So like I said,

728
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,340
we're in the age of the data breach

729
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,153
and stuff like this is really inexcusable.

730
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,440
To give you an idea,

731
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,740
all of the websites that we're showing

732
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,280
are in Alexis top 5,000.

733
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,590
Like you may not have heard
of some of these websites,

734
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,100
but they are the top
websites on the internet.

735
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,653
So to have something like this is,

736
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:46,020
it's really just
irresponsible, quite frankly.

737
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,620
It's completely irresponsible,

738
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,480
and it's causing major problems across

739
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,380
the internet these days.

740
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,130
Like even the fucking
colonial pipeline hack

741
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,530
was the credential stuffing attack

742
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,570
against their VPN, right?

743
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,720
So I mean,

744
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,700
that can be completely
unrelated websites got breached,

745
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,970
and then a VPN got breached.

746
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,420
Like we can't have websites
like this out there

747
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,190
that are just giving
usernames and passwords.

748
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,770
And we also know now from
all these aggregators,

749
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,630
that are being built

750
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,990
and all the password
research that's going on,

751
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,460
that one, people are fucking
terrible at passwords.

752
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,030
Like, you know, we get
the secret five one,

753
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,260
and that's all of a sudden
the fucking secure password.

754
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,280
But the other thing is

755
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,820
that people reuse their
passwords everywhere.

756
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,160
So even if it's a site

757
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,710
that you don't necessarily care about,

758
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,740
if you reuse that password
in one single place,

759
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,300
somebody could easily find it,

760
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,350
and that's all I have to say about that.

761
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,793
- Yeah.

762
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,160
I think the next example is
actually pretty cool one.

763
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,470
So this is a traversal attack,

764
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,790
which means that we can put in the URL,

765
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,640
the path to a different file

766
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,450
or something that the web server

767
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,650
should definitely not
be allowed to access,

768
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,350
or certainly shouldn't be showing to

769
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,960
a random website viewer.

770
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,400
But we're doing this with
the passwords file in Linux,

771
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,610
and what that does is it gives us a list

772
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,050
of all the different users and groups,

773
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,960
including all the system
users that this server has.

774
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
And this is a massive
problem because basically

775
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,440
this means that we can view
files on the server easily.

776
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,150
So we could go through this list,

777
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,570
find a username that we think is a person

778
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,980
or like an actual user.

779
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,530
And then try to, for example,

780
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,430
view their private key,

781
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,120
their SSH private key.

782
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,953
If we had that,

783
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:31,300
then we could also take a
few guesses that maybe some,

784
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,990
if it's on a VM or it's just,

785
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,400
you know, hosting this website even,

786
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,030
you know, maybe it's using
some common frameworks

787
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,010
like WordPress or something.

788
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,010
So WordPress has some
default installed folder.

789
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,730
So maybe we can then go

790
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,040
and try to look at the config file

791
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,430
and get the database password.

792
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,220
So now we could potentially
login to the server

793
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,800
and access the database freely,

794
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,830
or the database of another
server being hosted

795
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,010
on the same VM.

796
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,700
I mean, this server's vulnerable,

797
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,533
which means really,

798
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:59,040
it's putting all of its neighbors at risk.

799
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,270
And it's just, again, it's just so silly,

800
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,453
like, you know, fix the permissions.

801
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:05,990
- Yeah.

802
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,823
- Yeah.

803
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:09,150
Lastly, this one is just sort of a bit of,

804
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,440
you know, beating a dead horse here.

805
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,450
But Kickstarter has a cross-site
scripting vulnerability.

806
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,750
So I just hit refresh here,

807
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,037
you know, punks buttered back.

808
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:16,870
(laughs)

809
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,080
Nothing shows this off better.

810
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,860
But Kickstarter is a bigger organization.

811
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,130
They can afford, you know,

812
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,530
like one intern to just go through

813
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,990
and check for obvious
scripting vulnerabilities

814
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,823
and stuff like that.

815
00:30:27,823 --> 00:30:29,260
I mean, there's really no reason for this.

816
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,070
You give this company money,

817
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,820
you have login credentials,

818
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,510
you have user data.

819
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,130
I mean, I don't even know
what else they probably have

820
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,963
on the backend,

821
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:39,350
but you know, you're putting
people at risk with this.

822
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,183
- Yeah.

823
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,923
- Cool.

824
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,590
So all right, let's
head back to the slides.

825
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:45,581
All right.

826
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:48,740
So, you know, how is
this being used, Alex?

827
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,720
- Wonderful question, Jason.

828
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,290
So I feel like we're new
tankers or something.

829
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,123
(laughs)

830
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:58,200
But anyway, so you're
probably wondering, of course,

831
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,220
so we're releasing a fuck ton
of vulnerabilities, right?

832
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,920
And we're just giving them out for free.

833
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,790
So how do you access them, right?

834
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,150
A few ways you can use this.

835
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,370
One, is the browser extension,

836
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,500
which we've showing you.

837
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,105
Of course, very, very useful.

838
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:16,580
Please download that and
use it if you like it.

839
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,887
There's a free and open REST API.

840
00:31:17,887 --> 00:31:20,810
You can search by
vulnerability, domain name,

841
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,650
wild cards are all allowed.

842
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,730
You have even character wild
cards and things like that.

843
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,870
So full wild card search,

844
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,050
there's no limitation there.

845
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,470
There's a CLI tool that
you can use as well,

846
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,390
built by the wonderdul
Mr. Hopper over here.

847
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,990
So you can get stuff like that as well.

848
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,823
Soon the come,

849
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:41,960
search engine interface,

850
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,540
already an alpha.

851
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,260
Jason already showed you some of that.

852
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,830
It's certified vulnerability, domain name,

853
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,160
wildcard scan, all in play.

854
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,280
We don't limit any of that kind of stuff.

855
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,397
Recon-ng module.

856
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:53,880
Tim Tome, you know him.

857
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,250
Wonderful man, wonderful software.

858
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,150
H8mail module, if you use that.

859
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,983
Metasploit module,

860
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,900
just because everything
needs to Metasploit module

861
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,950
and really anything that you all feel

862
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,500
that you would like to see with this data,

863
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,100
just shoot us ideas.

864
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,590
We can build it or you
can submit something,

865
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,350
it's an open source, you
know, thing, whatever,

866
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,050
but let us know how we can
support you to support.

867
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:20,980
Yeah.

868
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,830
- Help us help you.

869
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,500
- Let us know how can
we help you, basically,

870
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,090
and we will help you out, so.
- Yeah.

871
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,240
- Moving on from there.

872
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,810
How do we do this, right?

873
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,460
We get this question a good amount.

874
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,753
How do you scan that many websites?

875
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,470
You had to create your own scanner.

876
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,580
You had your own fucking
internet service provider,

877
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,200
et cetera, et cetera.

878
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,037
The real answer is it
was just a ton of work

879
00:32:43,037 --> 00:32:44,760
and a lot of benchmarking, right?

880
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,380
The original PunkSPIDER was
built on old technology.

881
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,610
So there's a bunch of
benchmarking I had to do

882
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,247
in terms of what's important.

883
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:53,080
What's important here?

884
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,917
Computing power, memory, bandwidth, IO,

885
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,750
all kinds of different things.

886
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,350
So there was all kinds of
tests that we needed to run

887
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,960
to make sure that everything
was running as smoothly

888
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,911
and as quickly as possible.

889
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:06,440
We had some creative
engineering in there, right?

890
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,980
So we've repurposed a lot of technology

891
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,230
that's really built for,

892
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,970
you know, search engine technology,

893
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,100
data analytics technology,

894
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,933
all of that stuff

895
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:19,120
is being used in the
backend of PunkSPIDER.

896
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,280
It's just we're completely repurposing it

897
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,910
for the purposes of offensive security.

898
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,320
Last thing that we did is we
embraced the cloud, right?

899
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,153
Ride the snake,

900
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:28,770
meaning we're addicted.

901
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,740
We're all of a sudden addicted to heroin.

902
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,300
I mean, AWS.

903
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,133
- Same thing.

904
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,900
- What's that?

905
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,883
- Same thing.

906
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:36,716
- Same thing, yeah.

907
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:39,770
Very, very similar things
to make addicted too.

908
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,200
Both can costly thousands
of dollars a month.

909
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,363
AWS is probably more dangerous,

910
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:47,610
but we really embraced it

911
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,130
and we just realized like,

912
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,720
you know, the world is kind of
moving in in that direction,

913
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,320
and so we may as well take
advantage of that, right?

914
00:33:56,521 --> 00:33:57,621
So next slide, insert.

915
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:00,200
All right, all I wanna show you

916
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,510
is that we do have metrics

917
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,570
and monitoring on the
backend of the system.

918
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,790
Like I said, it is a very well-funded,

919
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,253
well-engineered system at this point.

920
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,190
All I'm showing you here at the top left,

921
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,267
you'll see the word Ferret.

922
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:16,290
Ferret is our custom built scanner,

923
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,150
and all I really wanted to show you here

924
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,140
is that there's a bunch
of different scan nodes,

925
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,410
and each of those scan nodes is handling

926
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,370
thousands of different websites.

927
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:29,240
So this would get reshuffled
and things like that,

928
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,660
as more data either comes in

929
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,250
or this cluster is scaled more,

930
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,083
which is, to me,

931
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,293
it looks like it needs to be
skilled a little bit more,

932
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,900
but it's a good view into the fact

933
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,090
that we are doing truly, truly
mass distributed scanning.

934
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,243
So we can move onto the next.

935
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,773
Yeah.

936
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:51,020
So actually you could skip this slide.

937
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,340
- Okay.

938
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,173
- All right.

939
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:54,006
Thank you, sir.

940
00:34:54,006 --> 00:34:55,900
So how does this work, right?

941
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,770
I wanted to give you a basic
architecture of PunkSPIDER.

942
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,010
We have a Kafka Queue.

943
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,800
Kafka is a simple queuing system.

944
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
So something comes in

945
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,160
and something comes out

946
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,350
to a system that's ingesting that, right?

947
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,140
The reason that we need a queuing
system in order to do this

948
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,660
is that we are submitting so many URLs

949
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,590
that we need a piece of
technology that is distributed

950
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,810
and allows us to handle the level of data

951
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,790
that we're talking about

952
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,390
because we're submitting something like

953
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,860
tens of billions of domains,

954
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,580
which means hundreds of billions,

955
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,880
if not trillions of actual webpages.

956
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,280
So queuing technology is
really important here,

957
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,290
and it's used very much
with throughout PunkSPIDER.

958
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,184
Next slide, please, sir.

959
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:37,017
(laughs)
- The ferrets.

960
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:38,600
- Infinite Ferrets, right?

961
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,240
So because that Kafka queue,

962
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,340
again, distributed,

963
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,090
just gives you a website.

964
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,050
We need something to
then scan that website.

965
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,470
As I mentioned, that application
is called Ferret, right?

966
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,880
So that's our web app fuzzer.

967
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,140
It works really quickly,

968
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,850
works in a distributed manner

969
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,880
that kind of Kubernetes autoscaling.

970
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,160
So we need a lot of
Ferrets to really be able

971
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,680
to scan all of these websites

972
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,640
and get all of the data that we want,

973
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,420
and then present that back to you,

974
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,463
which is done in the next slide.

975
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:13,270
And we see that we index these results

976
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,530
into two different things.

977
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,560
One is RDS for stats,

978
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,500
and the other thing is cloud search

979
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,500
to obviously build the search
engine frontend for everybody.

980
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,910
So all of this is kind
of a simplified view

981
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,660
into the entire thing.

982
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,883
This feeds back into the
queuing system, actually.

983
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,370
And yeah, this goes back
into the queuing system

984
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,470
and can even create
more URLs for us to scan

985
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,303
and things like that.

986
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:44,130
So that's basically how
it works on the backend.

987
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,460
What I really wanted to point out

988
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,250
is that everything is fucking distributed.

989
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,410
Everything is distributed.

990
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,030
That's why I have pictures
of lots of ferrets,

991
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,400
pictures of lots of copycats,

992
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,334
pictures of lots of results, right?

993
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:56,160
Everything is distributed,

994
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,377
so we can scale sky is the limit.

995
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,209
- Cool.

996
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:03,690
- Let me grab more data from IOStation,

997
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,150
which Jason's gonna tell you about.

998
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,983
- Yeah.

999
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:09,640
So, you know, running a
datacenter has been a lot of work.

1000
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,473
It's interesting.

1001
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:12,590
It's one of those things
where you have to decide

1002
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,740
where you want to put
your time and effort.

1003
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,470
I've built this system on
Postgres, which is awesome.

1004
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,190
If there's a really specific reason,

1005
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,023
I'll use something else,

1006
00:37:21,023 --> 00:37:22,230
but I use Postgres a lot.

1007
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,760
Rabbit MQ, I used for years.

1008
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,900
However, I had an issue
where it would just

1009
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,580
like disconnect consumers all the time.

1010
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,740
So all of the sensors will
be passing messages to it

1011
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,550
and then the consumers
would get disconnected.

1012
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,100
And then the queues would get so big

1013
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,960
that they would stop delivering messages,

1014
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,850
which makes no sense.

1015
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,683
And then even worse,

1016
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:41,070
they'd continue to get big

1017
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,800
and eventually explode the nodes.

1018
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,510
So I eventually replaced it with Kafka,

1019
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,740
which, you know, isn't perfect,

1020
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,380
but I've definitely had
much better results overall.

1021
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,660
And the rest of it is
kind of Bash and Python,

1022
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,350
because I've been developing
this myself to this point,

1023
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,840
and so kind of simplicity is key.

1024
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,340
You know, we're moving as
much complexity as you can

1025
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,021
in a lot of ways.

1026
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:02,380
It will make your life a little easier,

1027
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,840
when it's just, you know,

1028
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,480
one person operation that is.

1029
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,560
So Alex showed his UI.

1030
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,920
So I thought I'd toss mine up here too.

1031
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,300
It's pretty simple.

1032
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,910
You know, you type in an
IP address, search it.

1033
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,470
It shows on the map where it's resolving.

1034
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,500
We've got GIP and Whois data?

1035
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,810
And then for the port scan data,

1036
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,720
it shows each port in a different card.

1037
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,740
And I think I mentioned before,

1038
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,360
you know, it's scanning over 25 ports,

1039
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,150
there's a lot of custom extractions

1040
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,820
that are going on in this.

1041
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,010
And then, of course, the normal stuff,

1042
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,680
like, you know, service
identification and banners,

1043
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,513
and stuff like that.

1044
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:34,380
And it's too much to
show in one screenshot,

1045
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,400
but below is where all the
listening service data is.

1046
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,570
And then there's SSL certs
and things like that.

1047
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,270
This website has never been public

1048
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,920
nor probably will it ever be.

1049
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,650
But you know, can't let someone
show their old UI alone.

1050
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,620
It's not appropriate.

1051
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,420
So just a really quick
little case study, I guess,

1052
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,170
of something the thing that has been

1053
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,390
coming across IOStation.

1054
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,890
So there's this thing
called the Mozi botnet.

1055
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,960
Back in 2019, I started observing it.

1056
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,250
It's known to other people,

1057
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,660
it's a really big bottleneck right now.

1058
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,910
And basically, it's trying to
command injection on servers.

1059
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,050
So these are the two URLs
that I see most of the time,

1060
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,700
and you can see one of them
is next file = net gear.cfg.

1061
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,540
And then it pulls,

1062
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,660
it would get pulls this thing from an IP

1063
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,610
and port mozi.m is the file name,

1064
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,570
and then it runs it.

1065
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,680
And then similarly, the other
one does the same thing,

1066
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,010
but Mozi.a, it executes
it slightly differently.

1067
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,800
But basically this looks
like it's trying to do this

1068
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,710
on netgear equipment at a minimum.

1069
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,170
And we know from PunkSPIDER
that there are tons of websites

1070
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,040
that are vulnerable to
injection like this, so.

1071
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,320
So I started digging a little bit deeper

1072
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,030
and I used to listening, sorry,

1073
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,690
I use this data to identify

1074
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,520
where the attacks were coming from

1075
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,350
and where the malware was being hosted.

1076
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,328
And interestingly,

1077
00:39:42,328 --> 00:39:44,042
they were always different IP addresses,

1078
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:45,930
whatever service, or sorry,

1079
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,650
whatever computer was saying,

1080
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,000
go download and run those malware

1081
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,860
was never the same IP addresses
where it was being hosted.

1082
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,530
And they were mainly hosted
in China, like predominantly,

1083
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,760
you know, definitely some in India.

1084
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,890
And of course it's a botnet,

1085
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,640
so it's spread across the world.

1086
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,450
But there was a huge amount
of it coming from China,

1087
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,283
which was interesting

1088
00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:05,760
because then when I looked at what sensors

1089
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,280
is the botnet was hitting mostly?

1090
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,780
It was really heavily hitting
India, Japan, Australia,

1091
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,820
and then to a slightly lesser degree,

1092
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,150
Canada and Germany,

1093
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,460
but there were no hits in China,

1094
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,300
which was kind of funny.

1095
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,790
And I'm not trying to suggest
that this is some sort of

1096
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,770
like, you know, clever state
sponsored piece of malware

1097
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,050
or anything like that.

1098
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,883
I just thought it was funny

1099
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,100
that none of my Chinese servers
actually saw any of this

1100
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,010
and it almost looks like
kind of a geopolitical map,

1101
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,080
you know, a little bit.

1102
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,253
So yeah, China's
suspiciously missing there.

1103
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,150
You know, I did dig in to look at

1104
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,030
what devices were actually
being part of this botnet,

1105
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,420
and it definitely look a
lot of D-Link, Netgear,

1106
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,890
and Huawei gear.

1107
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,470
I saw IPCameras, DVRs.

1108
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,832
There were some GPON devices,

1109
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:48,690
which was a little interesting.

1110
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,440
I didn't really see
anything that indicated

1111
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,410
it was part of any sort of
like corporate structure

1112
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,243
or anything.

1113
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:56,050
But the software being used
are a lot of web servers,

1114
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,030
but they're all like kind
of small lightweight ones

1115
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,260
that you see being used in
sort of embedded devices

1116
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,093
and things like that,

1117
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:02,250
like home routers.

1118
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:07,250
And I did notice that the
lighttpd version that I saw,

1119
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,320
a lot of actually 1.4.39
had just a ton of CVEs

1120
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,420
and many of them were just like blanket,

1121
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,490
you know, remote code execution
vulnerabilities and stuff,

1122
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,200
which was kind of cool.

1123
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,920
So I did kind of poke around
at a few of these things,

1124
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,800
like what they were showing,

1125
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,870
and I found this kind of cool example.

1126
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,750
This was just somebody part of the botnet.

1127
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,240
It has an interface that
looks a lot like dealing.

1128
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,810
I didn't try to login
or anything like that.

1129
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,130
The links on the top made you login,

1130
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,740
but I did dig around the JavaScript

1131
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,150
'cause it really wasn't
that much actually.

1132
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,870
And I saw that it was
crafting these links,

1133
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,440
so I went to a few of them directly

1134
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,250
like a sys status.asp, for example.

1135
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,010
And, you know, I guess it
doesn't always want you to login.

1136
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,370
So if you go to them directly
at the login page actually,

1137
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,290
works, or sorry, is bypassed.

1138
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,790
And I was able to see all
the internal DHB tables,

1139
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,060
and all the routing
information and all that stuff.

1140
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,430
And, you know, while this
isn't some, you know,

1141
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,260
egregious vulnerability
necessarily on its own right.

1142
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,860
It's just kind of illustrating like,

1143
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,850
this is the kind of nonsense

1144
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,640
that is still all over the internet.

1145
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,300
Like I know security has been a hot topic.

1146
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,610
It's getting better, I think,

1147
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,370
I think, anyway.

1148
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,950
But there's still craziness like this,

1149
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,520
where this person's router
just like lets you login,

1150
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,900
and yeah, that's kind of crazy to me.

1151
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,470
So, you know, we're kind of
running out of time here,

1152
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,030
but I'm sure the burning
question in everyone's mind is

1153
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,010
where's this all going?

1154
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,920
So where where's it going, Alex?

1155
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,753
- Right.

1156
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:26,000
So I just want to recap
for everybody, right?

1157
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,210
So a couple of quick things.

1158
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,800
Created a hugely scalable system

1159
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,790
for fuzzing a fuckton of URLs.

1160
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,660
We've had a bunch of
vulnerabilities in major websites.

1161
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,000
We've even found zero days

1162
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,120
in a popular forum technology, right?

1163
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,120
So obviously, the probably
most important part of that

1164
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,300
is that we're releasing
that out to you all,

1165
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,133
the public.

1166
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,540
And we want to keep these results updated

1167
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,810
while still continuing
to go extremely broad.

1168
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,510
Our target is still the entire internet.

1169
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,660
We're not gonna let down on that target.

1170
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,410
We're gonna continue engineering

1171
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,720
until we've reached that target

1172
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,500
and we can keep the
records reasonably updated

1173
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,230
to a certain degree, right?

1174
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,940
So how can you kind of help us, right?

1175
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,830
So I mentioned throwing us ideas,

1176
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,640
obviously, it's is really helpful,

1177
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,240
but download that extension.

1178
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,173
Use that CLI tool, start
calling out websites,

1179
00:43:18,768 --> 00:43:22,370
all of these things are really helpful

1180
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,840
and not only at the PunkSPIDER,

1181
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,870
but part of the mission
of PunkSPIDER, really.

1182
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,223
We built this for you all.

1183
00:43:31,503 --> 00:43:33,503
So feel pretty use it basically, is all.

1184
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,810
- As far as IOStation is concerned,

1185
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:40,790
you know, I think that
continuing to transform

1186
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:45,170
my mindset from pure
cybersecurity to evaluating risk

1187
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,850
and risk scoring is really interesting.

1188
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,880
So I wanna continue kind
of going down that path.

1189
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,010
That's not to say that there
won't still be the broad

1190
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,360
internet collection tools
that have been working with

1191
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,080
and know and love,

1192
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,270
but it's just that some
of the newer features

1193
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,890
that are coming out probably
will be geared towards that.

1194
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,870
Especially when it comes
to critical infrastructure

1195
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,190
and industrial control systems,

1196
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,190
which for anyone paying
attention to the news lately,

1197
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:07,590
I'm sure knows has been a
bit of a hot button topic

1198
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:08,910
when it comes to certain pipelines,

1199
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:09,953
which may not be named.

1200
00:44:09,953 --> 00:44:11,210
(laughs)

1201
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,470
But I think that's a
really fascinating area,

1202
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,120
and especially one that's, you know,

1203
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,453
obviously, increasing importance.

1204
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,290
I know there's a lot of utilities

1205
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,610
and things that have really ignored

1206
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,010
their cybersecurity posture,

1207
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:25,670
and they're starting to get bit by it.

1208
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,510
And anyways, that's something
I think we need to look at.

1209
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,240
And the other one is a
little bit more vague,

1210
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,210
but really trying to identify
attacker infrastructure.

1211
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,150
Like are there things
that we can be observing

1212
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,232
from the outside

1213
00:44:37,232 --> 00:44:41,120
to identify what an attacker is using

1214
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,160
and how they're organizing?

1215
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,250
But you know, maybe early
or on the onset or whatever,

1216
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,210
as early as possible obviously is better.

1217
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,860
You know, is there
software that can be probed

1218
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,330
and identified running
across the internet?

1219
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:56,960
Are there any sort of particular
techniques or patterns

1220
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,190
or signatures or anything
like that that we can extract?

1221
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,310
You know, this one is
not as well thought out.

1222
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,870
Obviously, it's just something that

1223
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,640
I think we're pretty interested
in tracking down long-term,

1224
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,260
but I think that about wraps it up for us.

1225
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,900
So yeah, if you want to shoot us an email

1226
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,640
or whatever, feel free.

1227
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,100
You can, you know, visit our office,

1228
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,846
but Alex and I won't be there, so.

1229
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,210
(laughs)

1230
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,350
- Yeah.

1231
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,910
Thanks everybody for coming in,

1232
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,250
and listening to our talk.

1233
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,530
We really appreciate it.

1234
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,880
And, you know, thank you
all for taking the time

1235
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,520
to listen us, ramble on about the system,

1236
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,770
and I hope you really enjoyed it.

1237
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,730
- Yeah, thanks everyone.

1238
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,030
Take it easy. Bye bye.

1239
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,280
- Peace everybody. Later.
