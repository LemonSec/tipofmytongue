1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,890
- Okay, looks like we're up and running.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,183
Hi everybody, welcome.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,300
Hi DEFCON, hi DEFCON 29.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,760
Thanks for everybody tuning
in from wherever you are.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,810
Hopefully next year we get
to all do this in person.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,810
Here we are.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,390
So hi guys, my name's Richard.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,480
We'll get to that in a second.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,080
This is my talk on barcodes
and Old McDonald had a barcode,

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,140
E-I-E-I CAR.

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,010
I have to apologize for
me looking back and forth.

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,823
I have two monitors and my
slides are on another one.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,850
So who am I? My name is Richard Henderson.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,893
I'm a ham radio nerd.
I'm an electronics dork.

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,070
I write for a living a lot,
I'm a InfoSec professional.

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,933
I currently work as a CSO.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,720
I've trained at DEFCON
multiple years in the past.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,030
I've gone 25, 26, 27,

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,233
DEFCON China Beta One.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,050
I've run the Ham Radio
Fox Hunt Contest at DEFCON

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,370
for a few years.

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,287
Did not run it this year,

23
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:08,010
didn't know what was going to happen.

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,550
So,

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,370
it'll be back next year, I hope.

26
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,800
And richsentme is how you can find me on

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,870
Twitter and LinkedIn.

28
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,483
So feel free to connect.

29
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,603
So,

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,830
let's talk here for a second.

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,890
What would happen if you built
a system that was designed to

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,460
take inputs from barcodes that

33
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,793
didn't do any sort of input validation.

34
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,240
What sort of hi-jinks could you get up to?

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,070
Could you crash a system
with nothing more than just

36
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,893
a simple string of text?

37
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,713
You sure can.

38
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,580
We'll come back to this
screenshot multiple times

39
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,173
during the talk and we'll
explain what it is we're seeing.

40
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,063
The bottom line is yes,

41
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:55,790
there are a lot of systems out there that

42
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,480
through nothing more than
presenting in a string of text,

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,693
we'll make it fall over crash,
reboot, denial of service.

44
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,363
So let's talk about the EICAR string.

45
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,900
The EICAR string is kind of the key here.

46
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,820
Although we'll get to other strings that

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,720
might cause mischief later.

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,410
But in this case, we're talking
specifically about EICAR.

49
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,450
So what is the EICAR string?

50
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,650
That's the EICAR string.

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,120
It's a substantially long
enough, random piece of text

52
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,123
that

53
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,440
with enough randomness in it

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,610
that you wouldn't find it just by chance.

55
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,580
So you know that if you
see this string of text,

56
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,380
you are looking at the EICAR string.

57
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,900
So who created it?

58
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,750
What's it used for? How does it work?

59
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,645
In a nutshell, the EICAR
test file was created by the

60
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:54,380
European Institute for
Computer Antivirus Research,

61
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,650
EICAR.

62
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,210
And it's a method to test
the functionality and

63
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,920
the ability of antivirus
engines to actually function.

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,650
So it's used by pretty much
every antivirus company or

65
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,360
tech company that incorporates

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,890
some sort of antivirus
technology into their product.

67
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,730
So think like firewalls,
email security appliances,

68
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,580
things like that.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,300
And they use it to make sure
their AV engines are working.

70
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,170
Well, why would they do that?

71
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,523
Well, when you're working with malware,

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,520
you want to avoid using real
malicious malware samples

73
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,860
whenever possible.

74
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,710
Unless you have to work with
something really malicious.

75
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,940
And the reason for that is
imagine if you were just trying

76
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,180
to test your firewall to see

77
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,120
if it could detect a piece of malware

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,853
as it moved past the
firewall, but it failed.

79
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,910
And you decided you'd use
the latest and greatest

80
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,010
piece of ransomware that you found online.

81
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,460
When that ransomware escaped
through the network and started

82
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,420
infecting other machines,
that'd be pretty bad, right?

83
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,523
So EICAR came about as a way
to safely test antivirus.

84
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,960
Create a text string,

85
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,040
which you can embed in another small file.

86
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,140
You can compress it, hide it,

87
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,070
and see if you're antivirus
engine can detect it.

88
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,020
Think of it as a virus that the

89
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,360
general antivirus community
has decided is a virus,

90
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,713
but doesn't have any malicious
capabilities whatsoever.

91
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,890
Okay. QR codes.

92
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,793
Everybody's seen QR codes
now, right, I would think.

93
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,320
Who created those? What are they used for

94
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,540
and how do they work?

95
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,417
So the "QR" in QR code
means "quick response".

96
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:50,740
And it was created by the
Japanese auto parts manufacturer,

97
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,000
DENSO, in the mid 1990s.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
If you own a Japanese car,

99
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,470
your car is likely full of
DENSO parts, oxygen sensors,

100
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,870
computers, things like that.

101
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,750
So why did they create it?

102
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,970
Well, there's a bunch of
reasons, but the main reason is

103
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,210
you can simply just store
a lot more information

104
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,530
in a QR code that you can in...

105
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
Do I have one around here somewhere?

106
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,803
Here we go.

107
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,173
Than in a

108
00:05:24,586 --> 00:05:25,919
simple UPC card.

109
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,830
I'm not going to show you
the whole UPC code because

110
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,420
that's got some sets of data on it.

111
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,440
And it's so like, you
know, a standard UPC code,

112
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,990
you'd see on a box of
cookies at the grocery store.

113
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,383
So,

114
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,940
what's inside a QR code?

115
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,900
So QR codes are really, really brilliant

116
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,128
when you look at them

117
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:50,530
and you start to dissect how they work.

118
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,793
So if you see 4.1. Position.

119
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,220
What that means... I'm
pointing at the screen,

120
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,263
which I guess in a virtual talk,
doesn't really do anything.

121
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,010
The position squares basically
tell the scanning computer

122
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,530
how to orient the barcode.

123
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,680
You could see there's always
those three position squares

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,250
and there's never a position
square in the bottom right

125
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,530
of a barcode.

126
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,290
And that allows the
computer to know that when

127
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,190
they're taking a picture of a QR code,

128
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,970
like this one right here,

129
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,023
it doesn't matter what way it's scanned.

130
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,950
The computer always knows that

131
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,343
this spot right here should be,

132
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,113
so this is mirrored, but
it should be right there.

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,840
Alignment is really neat.

134
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,213
So alignment squares are
used by the QR code to.

135
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,790
See, even though, if you
present the barcode to it

136
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,360
like this on an angle,

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,150
it knows the alignment square
right here is a square.

138
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,040
So it can create like those
magic converging lines

139
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,040
we did an art school and high school,

140
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,350
in art class in high school.

141
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,760
To know that it can
correct the image to make

142
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,970
everything square or square facing

143
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:10,594
the computer.

144
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,430
So what would happen if you
put the two and two together?

145
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,573
You put the EICAR string on a QR code.

146
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,173
Well, you get something like this.

147
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,630
So again, I'm going to come
back to this screenshot

148
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,010
in a couple of minutes and
explain exactly what it is

149
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,843
we're looking at

150
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:40,850
and where this screenshot was taken.

151
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,453
But let's stop for a minute.

152
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,930
And we're going to talk about

153
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,470
where did this whole thing start?

154
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,537
Where did the idea of

155
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,060
turning EICAR into

156
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,960
a QR code come from?

157
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,610
So, special shout out
to my friend on Twitter,

158
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,040
Rob Rosenberger,

159
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,770
who planted the seed in my head
that there's probably a lot

160
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,990
of systems out there that
could scan a QR code.

161
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,270
And a lot of them won't know
what to do when they see the

162
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,600
EICAR string.

163
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,663
So in this case, if you
look at the tweet here,

164
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,130
he put the EICAR string as a
QR code on the side of his car,

165
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,260
I think on the front of his car as well,

166
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,970
with the idea of

167
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,410
maybe triggering antivirus response on

168
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,000
license plate scanners, toll
booths, things like that.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,520
But what was interesting is
that the antivirus they had

170
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,220
running on his Android phone
also triggered detection.

171
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,670
So we're gonna talk a little
bit more about attack surfaces

172
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,870
in a couple minutes,
but the idea here was to

173
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,040
get the code

174
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:49,090
picked up by cameras you might encounter

175
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,120
whenever you're driving around.

176
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,558
So like toll booth cameras,
like automated toll booths,

177
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:56,790
automatic license plate reading cameras,

178
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,450
like the ones you see
on top of police cars or

179
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,170
by law enforcement cars,
municipal enforcement cars,

180
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,513
parking enforcement cars,

181
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,283
private parking lots is a good one.

182
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,750
So initially it was just a
guess as to what might work and

183
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,853
without access to the actual
system that scan the QR code.

184
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,460
If its scanned it, you
probably won't know for sure

185
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,703
if it actually triggered something.

186
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,930
But it definitely does work.

187
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,370
I'm gonna share a couple
video clips with you in a

188
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,623
couple of minutes to show
you that it actually works.

189
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,760
So beyond a sticker on your car,

190
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,410
what else could you do with this?

191
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,620
So enter the embroidered

192
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,573
EICAR QR patch.

193
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,440
So what do you think might
happen if you take the

194
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,640
EICAR text string with
you, wherever you go?

195
00:09:53,564 --> 00:09:55,714
Stick it on your
backpack, put it on a hat,

196
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,933
stick it on your shirt, whatever.

197
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:03,120
In many cases you'd have to be

198
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,140
really, really close to the camera

199
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,720
to have it pick up the QR code,

200
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,510
but cameras are getting
better all the time.

201
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,220
I mean, 4K cameras are not
particularly expensive anymore.

202
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,840
I have one at the front of my house now,

203
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,240
cost a couple hundred bucks.

204
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,020
Go to Costco, Costco sells
full 4K systems with dozens of,

205
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,120
well not dozens,

206
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,300
but a half dozen cameras
for a few hundred bucks.

207
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,200
So cameras are getting
better all the time,

208
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,680
and they're going to be
able to pick these up,

209
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,280
even if you're not particularly
close to the camera.

210
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:36,382
So.

211
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,460
Let's go to the next slide.

212
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,500
So devices that you think
would need to read or

213
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,863
interpret a QR code absolutely can.

214
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,140
So this is a checkout terminal

215
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,870
for a very large, multinational
retail/grocery chain

216
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,920
that I will not name.

217
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,980
Why would a checkout scanner that

218
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,650
should only need to
scan a standard UPC code

219
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,810
that you find on like a box of cereal

220
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,653
need to read a QR code at all?

221
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,690
Well, this is clearly added functionality

222
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,700
provided to the retailer

223
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,700
by the checkout, machine
checkout area manufacturer.

224
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,220
And it's probably built
into the product during the

225
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,203
development phase.

226
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,130
You know, things like

227
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,450
they might want to add loyalty coupons,

228
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,727
purchase tracking, things like that.

229
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,317
And also, for example, they'll send you

230
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:42,210
a QR code coupon on your
smartphone and you can scan it

231
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,680
and it can read it.

232
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,060
They build this into the product
because they want to offer

233
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,720
all of this to all the customers

234
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,140
and not all the customers
are gonna use it,

235
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,690
but they want it there
just in case, right?

236
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,780
That's how things work with
a lot of software today.

237
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,420
But what happened in this specific case?

238
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,570
So the code was scanned.

239
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,523
It correctly scanned the string.

240
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,250
Can you see my mouse?
No, I guess you can't.

241
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,060
But if you look at the top
left of the screenshot,

242
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,730
you can see that it clearly
read the EICAR string from

243
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,613
the QR code.

244
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,973
And it just instantly returned this error.

245
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,350
So what happened after this was scanned?

246
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,250
So the checkout became
unresponsive to all inputs.

247
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,040
Didn't matter what button you
press, what you tried to scan,

248
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,530
what you tried to do.

249
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,113
It was totally unresponsive.

250
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,620
Even a manual intervention by
the staff that are on site to

251
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,433
help you

252
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,533
check out,

253
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,440
really they're just there to
stop you from stealing stuff.

254
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,740
But they came over. They
couldn't make anything work.

255
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,573
They even said,

256
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:50,067
'We never seen anything like that before.'

257
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,200
And then the register
eventually rebooted itself

258
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,433
after quite a long wait.

259
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,040
So I'll talk about more about,

260
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,370
what's probably happening
behind the scenes in a minute,

261
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,550
but the reality is you could
walk by a group of checkouts

262
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,370
and scan this and crash every single one.

263
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,203
And

264
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,000
no one would have any idea how to fix it

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,290
until it fixed itself.

266
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,323
Okay. So.

267
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,020
I'm gonna play a video.

268
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,120
This video is sent to
me by a random friend,

269
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,870
cause I would never do
anything stupid like this.

270
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,170
That would be really dumb.

271
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,050
This is a passport scanner
at a port of entry,

272
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,273
some country, somewhere.

273
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,550
But many countries now
offer you the ability

274
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,640
to pull up your smartphone,

275
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,203
fill out your customs form ahead of time.

276
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:42,309
And that app creates...

277
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:44,530
I don't think I have one
available, let's see.

278
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:50,206
UI.

279
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,110
Yeah. It's not working. I'm sorry.

280
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,423
So,

281
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,883
they'll give you a QR code.

282
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:01,770
Basically, instead of getting those

283
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,550
old school paper customs forms

284
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,200
where you fill out where you
went, what flight you were on,

285
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,690
what date you were gone, how
much money you spent, you know,

286
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,610
do you have any drugs,
all that usual stuff,

287
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,780
you just check off a bunch of
boxes on a smartphone form.

288
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,770
And it gives you a QR code,

289
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,100
which the QR code contains the answers to

290
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,070
all your questions.

291
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,220
So what would happen if

292
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,740
you scanned one of those machines

293
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,120
with the EICAR string?

294
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,810
Let's see. And it's
going to be hard to see.

295
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,092
So I'll walk through it
here in a second, but let's.

296
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:34,342
- [Person From Video] Yeah.

297
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,333
- Stupid slides.

298
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,053
I'm gonna have to back up
here for a second. Sorry guys.

299
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,540
Okay.

300
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,650
So I can't pause it and show you,

301
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,830
but basically what happened
was that machine gave

302
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,660
a big fat red error message on the screen

303
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,020
and then froze completely

304
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,823
with just a total black screen.

305
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,480
So like I said,

306
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,350
I highly suggest you do not,
do not try this at a border

307
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,650
cause believe it or not,

308
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,310
customs officers don't really
like people screwing around

309
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,383
with machines at a port of entry.

310
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,250
So what happened here?

311
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,710
Don't know for sure.

312
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,540
But it did not like the input.

313
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,600
Was not expecting the input
that it was hoping to get

314
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,850
and it froze the machine.

315
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,630
Did not cause, as far as
I could tell, thankfully,

316
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,300
a general system outage
across multiple terminals,

317
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,410
which would have been real bad.

318
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,300
You literally could walk
over to the next machine

319
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,200
and scan your QR code there and it worked.

320
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,863
So what can we infer from that?

321
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,193
These terminals aren't super smart.

322
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,930
They limit the amount of
information they send back to

323
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,410
a central database or central source,

324
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,810
which makes sense because its
terminals are literally just

325
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,300
reading the questions you
filled out on that form

326
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,453
and filling out the form
for you via QR code.

327
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,110
But other systems are sending
the interpreted QR code to

328
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,840
a centralized location for processing.

329
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,320
So let's watch a few minutes of video

330
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,113
and then we'll explain what happened here.

331
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:34,868
- [Person Recording] Thanks Richard.

332
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,110
Now we're stuck here because
fucking Mike had to scan that

333
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,393
goddamn barcode.

334
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,660
He crashed the fucking machine.

335
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,510
It's fucked.

336
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,463
He scanned that fucking EICAR thing.

337
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,863
Now we're fucked.

338
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,350
Thanks Richard. Now we're
stuck here because...

339
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,693
Minutes later.

340
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:06,840
- [Attendant Over
Speaker] Sir, one moment.

341
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,703
- [Mike] Thank you.

342
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:36,880
- [Person Recording] Good job.

343
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,713
- [Mike] Are you recording a video?

344
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:40,613
- [Person Recording] Yes, I am. Good job.

345
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,910
- If they gave me the ticket back,

346
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,860
I could go to the other one.

347
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,860
- [Woman Recording] Yeah. Mr.
Scan-it-on-fucking-everything.

348
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:50,660
- [Attendant Over Speaker] Is
someone assisting you, sir?

349
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,303
- [Mike] No, there's nobody here.

350
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,510
I can use another machine,

351
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,017
but my ticket's in the machine, so.

352
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,473
- [Attendant Over Speaker]
Okay, one moment, sir.

353
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,641
- [Mike] Okay, thank you.

354
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,340
- [Person Recording] Fuck me.

355
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,430
- So, so,

356
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,570
he got one of those tickets

357
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,740
from the parking garage when you go in and

358
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,270
then he stuck the EICAR QR
code sticker on the ticket

359
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,400
and then inserted the
ticket into the machine

360
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,233
and

361
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:25,963
the ticket wouldn't
remove, nothing worked,

362
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,200
but there's still two more videos.

363
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,083
So let's keep watching.

364
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:36,580
- [Person Recording] 10 minutes later.

365
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,863
Still fucked.

366
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,599
- Hello hi there.

367
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,432
- [Attendant Over Speaker] Yes sir,

368
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:47,430
I am not able to reach
anyone at this moment.

369
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,180
Can I get your first and last name?

370
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,420
- I'll just go to, there's
a parking guy in the booth,

371
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,720
literally 20 feet behind me.

372
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,970
I'm just going to back
up and go talk to him.

373
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,046
Like he's sitting there-

374
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,137
- [Attendant Over Speaker]
Sir, if you want to do that.

375
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,272
- He's sitting there staring at me.

376
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,618
I don't know why he doesn't
want to just come over.

377
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:02,786
- [Attendant Over Speaker]
Well he should have came out

378
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:04,023
and help you, sir.

379
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,350
Long as he's sitting there.

380
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,580
- Yeah that would be nice,

381
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,820
but he's kind of an idiot apparently, so.

382
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,657
Anyway, I'll just back up and go see him.

383
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:12,640
- [Attendant Over Speaker]
Okay sir, you can do that

384
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,958
or I can just open the
gate and let you out.

385
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,080
I'll go talk to the guy.

386
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,651
Cause I mean-

387
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,790
- [Person Recording] Let's
just open the gate then.

388
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,745
- If you can open the gate you
can do that too, but I mean,

389
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,662
I haven't paid yet, so.

390
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,492
- [Attendant Over Speaker] If I can get

391
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:27,575
your name and number,

392
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:30,230
first and last name and a phone number.

393
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,870
- I'll just go to the
guy back here. It's fine.

394
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,952
Don't worry about it.

395
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:35,619
- [Attendant Over Speaker] Okay.

396
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:44,630
- [Person Recording] Okay
so, basically Mike crashed

397
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,310
the entire fucking payment system in

398
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,370
this entire fucking parking garage.

399
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,763
So no one can get out.

400
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,440
Apparently they can get
in, but that's about it.

401
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,593
Fucked.

402
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,623
So the attendant's going up
there to unlock the gate.

403
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,903
Go in front of this fucker.

404
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,793
Fucking hosed, bud.

405
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,683
Hosed.

406
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,433
Fucked up big time, buddy.

407
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,220
- [Mike] Yeah.

408
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,360
- Okay.

409
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,460
So what happened here?

410
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,070
What can we infer based on
what we saw in those clips?

411
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,860
People are still able
to get into the garage.

412
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,850
So clearly the ticket machines
that print a parking ticket

413
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,568
on the way in don't require
instant interactivity with

414
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:51,300
the database that's hosted somewhere else,

415
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,940
probably in a data center
in some remote area.

416
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,660
And it makes sense if you think about it

417
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,290
because you don't want to slow
the line down on the way in

418
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,120
if there's any sort of
network congestion or delay,

419
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,920
the inbound machines likely just record

420
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,350
a timestamp of entry,

421
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,710
generate a unique bar code
tied to that timestamp,

422
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,840
and then send it back to a database,

423
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,730
and set intervals every couple seconds,

424
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,623
couple minutes, who knows.

425
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,350
This would be great for
areas that don't have the

426
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,780
greatest internet connectivity.

427
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,780
So like, you know,

428
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,770
parking terminal, think three
levels down in a garage,

429
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,477
isn't going to have

430
00:21:27,477 --> 00:21:29,213
the greatest network connectivity, right?

431
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,970
Or in some cases they're
relying on cellular based links

432
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,273
and don't really want to waste bandwidth.

433
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,480
They want to save that for the exit phase,

434
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,250
which is what messed everything up.

435
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,660
So some people were able to exit

436
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,063
as you saw in the last clip,

437
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,890
but those were monthly parkers
who had a different type

438
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,400
of pass card to exit.

439
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,492
So there's probably an
entirely different system

440
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:54,283
that deals with that.

441
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:57,110
And if you look at the lot
of parking machines that

442
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,940
have a separate reader for

443
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,550
monthly parkers to scan their badge.

444
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,130
So there's probably just a
local file that cross references

445
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,130
unique IDs, tied to those ProxCards or

446
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,730
whatever ID card they use to get out.

447
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,180
And it looks for a match
and that opens the gate.

448
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,780
But for people who had to pay to exit,

449
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,180
there was no way to get out.

450
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,130
The machines ate their tickets
and gates wouldn't open.

451
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,910
So after that last video clip

452
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,140
my friends here talked
to the the attendant.

453
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,980
And basically he said his
PC wasn't working anymore.

454
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,640
He couldn't do anything.

455
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,993
He had to come out to
manually open the gate.

456
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,620
He'd never seen anything like it.

457
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,110
So clearly what's happened is
the QR string was transmitted

458
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,930
to some database somewhere
else and it caused...

459
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,120
Do I have notes on that?

460
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,953
I don't.

461
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,710
Oh yeah.

462
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,590
So string got transmitted to

463
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,140
another computer somewhere else.

464
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,920
And whatever AV was running
on that machine triggered

465
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,090
an antivirus alert and dropped
it into a quarantine cycle

466
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,400
to clean the virus.

467
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,950
And the whole system went down.

468
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,500
They were in there 15, 20 minutes

469
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,040
trying to get out the garage.

470
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,690
And so were lots of other people.

471
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,403
So.

472
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,820
Oh, did it again.

473
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,653
I'm sorry.

474
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,200
So why does this attack work?

475
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,740
Well, pretty simply,

476
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,180
much like we've seen in
the past decade or so with

477
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,700
industrial control
systems and SCADA systems

478
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,530
where companies have just
bolted on internet connectivity

479
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,650
to these devices with

480
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,060
very little or zero thought of

481
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,500
the security implications of doing so,

482
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,650
you know, they sell these to companies as

483
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,800
money saving measures.

484
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,030
You know, you don't have to
send a repair person out to

485
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,170
some remote pumping station

486
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,620
because you can do it all remotely now

487
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,520
cause they're all
connected to the internet.

488
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,490
They don't really spend
very much time thinking out

489
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,740
people might be able to
fuck with this stuff.

490
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,460
But the bigger part is that
most of these smart machines are

491
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,930
all running Windows or
Windows Embedded underneath.

492
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,080
So what does that mean?

493
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,850
So like, let's go back to a couple of

494
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,623
famous Windows Embedded malware attacks.

495
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,600
So Target and Home Depot are
two of the most famous ones.

496
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,170
Attackers were able to design malware

497
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,210
specifically built to skim
credit card numbers on those

498
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,760
Windows Embedded cash registers

499
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,323
and then exfiltrate all
that data somewhere else.

500
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,760
I mean,

501
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,593
everybody knows,

502
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:40,030
What's the one of the
first security measures

503
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,210
you put on a Windows machine?

504
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,793
You install antivirus, right?

505
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,500
So if your antivirus is just
some typical out of the box,

506
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,470
antivirus commodity product.

507
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,350
And if you haven't done any customization

508
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,250
or any tuning of it,

509
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,450
which is often the case.

510
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,780
It should see the EICAR string
think that it's being tested

511
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,840
and do exactly what it's
supposed to do in order to show

512
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,570
that it's working properly.

513
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,040
And that's quarantine the
system and clean it up.

514
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,310
So in most cases, an antivirus
hits a quarantine cycle,

515
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,143
what does it do?

516
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,423
A lot of AV makes the system
completely unresponsive,

517
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,690
makes it unavailable,

518
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,453
throws it into a reboot cycle
to do like a low-level clean.

519
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:30,633
And this is what's happening
here with a lot of these scans.

520
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,343
So.

521
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,533
Why are devices and systems
scanning QR codes anyways,

522
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,980
when they should only be
scanning like a UPC code?

523
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,813
Well,

524
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,460
there's lots of different
barcode formats out there.

525
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,790
And I'll talk about that
in a couple of minutes,

526
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,623
but

527
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,400
you don't always set
the standard UPC code.

528
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,680
There's dozens of different
types of barcode performance.

529
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,783
So they usually build in that
type of functionality to be

530
00:25:55,783 --> 00:25:58,670
able to cover all their bases, right.

531
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,487
So my gut tells me that
most owners have no idea

532
00:26:02,487 --> 00:26:05,640
that's even a thing on
the systems they have,

533
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,170
and it's probably not easy to turn it off,

534
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,370
not without going back to
the manufacturer and saying,

535
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,450
you know, we need to
disable these types of

536
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,423
inputs scans.

537
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,128
Why would you even ask that?

538
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:18,983
You wouldn't even think
to ask that question.

539
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,870
So, like I said earlier, you know,

540
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,930
added functionality by developer.

541
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,190
These companies want to be
all things to all people.

542
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,800
So they just build it in and
hide it from those people that

543
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,050
don't need it, but it's
there if you need it.

544
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:34,530
So let's talk about attack surfaces.

545
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,760
What other things might
you be able to scan

546
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,253
with the EICAR string?

547
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,573
So coupons, here's a carwash coupon,

548
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,990
A lot of newer or very
modernized car washes,

549
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,251
the really cool ones with the neon lights

550
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:55,460
and the 16 colors of foam
they spray on your car.

551
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,020
They have the ability to accept coupons

552
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,800
that you present to the payment machine.

553
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,450
And those coupons are often QR codes.

554
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,360
And why are they QR codes?

555
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,310
Because each QR code can be unique to

556
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,383
the person presenting it.

557
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:11,383
It's not like just a coupon code, right?

558
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,670
It allows them to track.

559
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,520
It allows the marketing people
to track the effectiveness of

560
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,730
advertising campaigns, right?

561
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,365
So they know if this person
used this coupon then

562
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:23,720
they'll probably do it again.

563
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,910
So you might want to offer them another,

564
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,153
but if someone else didn't use it,

565
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:29,360
then it may not be worth
spending the resources on them.

566
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,523
So what happens if you scan
the EICAR string there instead?

567
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,523
What else?

568
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,733
Price checking scanners.

569
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,580
Maybe, maybe not.

570
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,280
Really all depends what the
scanner does with the data

571
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,320
and what the underlying system is.

572
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,513
So Target, for example.

573
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,663
Newer Targets,

574
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:53,270
the newest price code scanners at Target

575
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,460
are all Android based tablets.

576
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,290
Not like this one on the screen.

577
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,413
This is an older one,

578
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,920
but while the Target Android ones

579
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,411
can read the EICAR string

580
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:05,430
and you could see it if
you go up and present it,

581
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,260
it'll actually interpret the string and

582
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,363
show it on the screen.

583
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,330
Nothing happens.

584
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,413
But other price code scanners?

585
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:15,563
Maybe.

586
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,390
So this is a discontinued older
one that you'll see in a lot

587
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,223
of stores.

588
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,570
And you can see here

589
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,493
that

590
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,480
it's running Windows CE 5.0,

591
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,140
and it says right on the top,

592
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,360
'fast and intuitive barcode reading of

593
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,290
all linear and 2D barcodes.'

594
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,540
So linear barcode is just
another way of saying like a

595
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,530
one dimensional barcode, like a UPC code.

596
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,510
And 2D means just that
two dimensional barcodes

597
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,343
like a QR code.

598
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,480
And like I said, it's running Windows.

599
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,567
So many of the new ones.

600
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,720
You go back, you go to like
a point of sale vendor,

601
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,170
people that provide
these types of products

602
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,693
to small stores and stuff.

603
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,610
Most of them all
transitioned over to Android,

604
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,350
but like we saw in Rob's tweet way back.

605
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,770
There's plenty of Android based
antivirus products out there

606
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,770
that detect the EICAR string
and will think there's a virus.

607
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,933
So what else?

608
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,090
Luggage tags.

609
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,023
Probably not.

610
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,540
All the luggage tags that
I've seen in my travels

611
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,410
and the ones I can find online,

612
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,860
all use the 1D barcode format with

613
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,510
a short identifier strings.

614
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,070
Typically it's just two
letters to signify the airline

615
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,520
and then a six digit

616
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,630
string of numbers to

617
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,803
uniquely identify that piece of baggage.

618
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,810
That doesn't mean there aren't
systems behind the scenes

619
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,890
that can interpret a 2D barcode.

620
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,723
So,

621
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:54,180
if you stuck the EICAR
strain to your suitcase,

622
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,013
who knows what would happen

623
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:56,850
and you probably never
know what would happen

624
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,320
unless you can find a friend
who works inside airport IT.

625
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,020
So if you're watching this
talk and you work inside an

626
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,230
airport infrastructure, and
you would like to try it out,

627
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,800
I would love to find out if it worked.

628
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,050
Feel free to let me know.

629
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,313
So the next one is my favorite.

630
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,760
Hard to see with the
screenshot here, I know.

631
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,593
But,

632
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,030
automated license plate readers

633
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,700
on police cars and parking enforcement,

634
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,423
private parking lots, ALPR.

635
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,000
Most of the police cars,
municipal enforcement,

636
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,750
private parking enforcement,

637
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,020
They all have Toughbooks in there cars.

638
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,390
You walk by these cars
and see Toughbooks, right?

639
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,073
Most Toughbooks are
always running Windows.

640
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,490
And if you look at the software,

641
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,530
I know it's really hard to see,

642
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,990
but you can see that
this is running Windows.

643
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,371
The software that's provided
by a very large company.

644
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:50,510
Obviously not going to name names,

645
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,323
but you can figure it out for yourself.

646
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,130
The company claims on its website,

647
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,430
that it works with all license plates.

648
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,770
No matter where they're from,

649
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,030
which means there's gotta
be a lot of flexibility,

650
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,530
and leeway for how it's
scanning things, right?

651
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,070
Because there's thousands of

652
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,240
different kinds of license plates,

653
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,600
different fonts, different spaces,

654
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,940
and different states and
provinces, things like that.

655
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,520
So what if you stuck on EICAR sticker

656
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,693
next to the license plate
and it picked it up?

657
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:20,914
It might.

658
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,260
I have another slide,

659
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,840
but I'm pretty sure I remember
a story way back when someone

660
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,660
printed a SQL string
on their hood in the UK

661
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,690
and it crashed the
speeding ticket cameras.

662
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,030
Does that ring a bell, anybody?

663
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,600
It's ringing a bell for me.

664
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,840
But amazingly, I have yet
to be able to find a parking

665
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,350
enforcement officer, a police officer,

666
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,500
who will actually let me actually try

667
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,100
to see if I can crash their system.

668
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,950
No matter how I phrase it
or how nice I try to be,

669
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,306
no matter how I frame it
around security research,

670
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:50,843
none of them are interested.

671
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,263
But what else?

672
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,230
QR codes are being much more prevalent

673
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:03,230
or much more used in things
like big events, sporting games,

674
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,333
concerts, things like that.

675
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:10,480
So could you present the EICAR
string to them as your ticket

676
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,603
and crash a central system?

677
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,773
It's very possible.

678
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,940
Hospitals.

679
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,263
Hospitals are likely very
susceptible to this attack.

680
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,640
Lots of backend systems
provided to hospitals

681
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,920
are Windows based.

682
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,030
I know this for a fact.

683
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,980
And I have someone close to
me who works in healthcare IT

684
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,050
and deals with this kind
of stuff all the time.

685
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,993
And their backend systems
are all Windows based.

686
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,030
So here's like a patient
bracelet with a type of QR code.

687
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,300
Here's for those of you with children,

688
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,260
when your a kid is born,

689
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,093
they put

690
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:54,340
a bracelet around the kid
and a bracelet around you

691
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,750
just to track the baby
through the hospital.

692
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,800
Make sure you leave with the right child.

693
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,253
Lots of QR codes on those ones.

694
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:08,383
So these are QR codes
on blood transfusions

695
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,143
just to make sure

696
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:12,325
the right person gets the right blood and

697
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:15,250
follows the chain of
custody of that blood as

698
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,750
it moves through the hospital.

699
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,600
So yeah, they should probably
start looking for this.

700
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,773
Extending this attack.

701
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,620
So how do you want to make
sure, if you're going to

702
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,120
test your own systems,

703
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,210
because this is the only time

704
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,033
you should be doing this, right guys?

705
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,990
There are, like I said earlier,

706
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,670
there are a lot of 2D
barcode types out there.

707
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,080
So you should try and figure out which one

708
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,633
your target is using.

709
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:48,683
So here's EICAR as a Data Matrix QR code.

710
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,660
Here's the Aztec format.

711
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,660
You see this a lot on like
Amazon packages, UPS boxes,

712
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,610
things like that.

713
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,930
That's the EICAR strain right there.

714
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,440
It doesn't look any
different than any other one.

715
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,820
MaxiCode, you used to see on a lot of,

716
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,620
it was either UPS or
FedEx a long time ago,

717
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,923
I think it was UPS.

718
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,570
I don't see that on their boxes anymore.

719
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,427
I really haven't been
paying attention to UPS

720
00:34:15,427 --> 00:34:17,010
and try not to use them.

721
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,740
MicroPDF417.

722
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,160
That's another barcode format

723
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,670
that you'll see in a lot of places.

724
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,220
There's the EICAR string there.

725
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,860
The Han Xin barcode
format obviously is one

726
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,040
you probably don't see much here,

727
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,870
but you might see it overseas a lot.

728
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,500
You might see it on
electronics components,

729
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,263
things like that that are
manufactured overseas.

730
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,320
These are some of the ones
that I was able to actually

731
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,220
encode the complete EICAR string into.

732
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,493
There are lots of other
barcode formats out there,

733
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:53,110
but most of them will not
take the EICAR string because

734
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,103
the character space is very limited.

735
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:56,403
In some cases it's just numeric,

736
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:58,382
in some cases it's just alphanumeric,

737
00:34:58,382 --> 00:34:59,370
some cases it doesn't use the

738
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,500
extended Unicode character set.

739
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,630
So there was no asterixis,
slashes or whatever.

740
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,950
So what I suggest you do is
just go online and look for

741
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,290
a barcode generator.

742
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,910
There's some really good ones
that will show all the dozens

743
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,573
of dozens of different
barcode formats out there.

744
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:17,550
And you can put in whatever
information you want.

745
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,430
There are some that are used

746
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,260
specifically for bank transfers,

747
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,660
where you put in account details

748
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,440
and a receiving bank, sending bank.

749
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,370
You could hide the EICAR string

750
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,870
in one of those pretty easily.

751
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,510
But beyond the EICAR string,

752
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,690
could you take some malicious JavaScript

753
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,920
and have a system parse it?

754
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,780
Or could you do something as
simple as sending someone to

755
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,130
a malicious URL?

756
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,173
Yeah, QR code.

757
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,383
You sure can.

758
00:35:45,383 --> 00:35:48,070
So this is from
(indistinct) many years ago.

759
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:51,950
Where this is, if you interpret
this QR code is just the,

760
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,630
the standard cross-site scripting

761
00:35:56,218 --> 00:35:57,790
alert script

762
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,920
that you would write to test for

763
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,610
the existence of a cross-site

764
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,493
scripting attack.

765
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,300
So you could use this to try
and maybe see if something is

766
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,773
vulnerable to a cross-site
scripting overload.

767
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,380
There are cases of malicious
QR codes being used in the past

768
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,873
in places like Russia,

769
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,040
to fool people into signing
up for premium SMS scams.

770
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,870
So like $6 a message type scams,

771
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,270
that's happened in the past.

772
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,880
But what other systems
might you be able to attack

773
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,983
beyond just like barcode scanners?

774
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,970
What would happen if you decided
to encode the EICAR string

775
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,593
into an RFID tag?

776
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,420
Automatic teller machines
often use Windows underneath.

777
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,050
Could you use the payWave/smart card?

778
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,750
You know, the little chip,
proximity chip thing that

779
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,790
you're seeing in a lot of places

780
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,150
around the world just to
quick, you know, tap and go,

781
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,100
could you code the string onto
a chip and scan it into the

782
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,173
ATM or the data machine?

783
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,250
So I'm not going to try and find out,

784
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,450
but maybe someone else will,

785
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,853
who owns an ATM for experimentation will.

786
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,160
Railroads.

787
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,560
A lot of railroads have
been using RFID tags on

788
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,230
cargo containers to
track cargo movement and

789
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,210
have been doing it for decades.

790
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,950
I first learned about this
more than 20 years ago

791
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,783
as I

792
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,390
was living in Toronto at the time.

793
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,740
And there was a main rail
line going right by the house

794
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,573
I was living at.

795
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:44,400
And we would often go like,
just watch the trains and stuff.

796
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,750
And there was a little hut.

797
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:52,526
And there was a big Yagi
antenna pointed at the tracks.

798
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,960
And you could see when train rolled by,

799
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,297
it was pointed in such a way,

800
00:37:56,297 --> 00:37:59,140
or it was just pointing at the
front edge of the containers

801
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,030
and doing some reading at the
time they stick RFID tags on

802
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,680
the containers to be able to tell

803
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:08,580
customers where their cargo is.

804
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,200
So if someone wants to know, you know,

805
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,240
I've got something that's gotta
be in Los Angeles in a week

806
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,950
and it's just leaving New Jersey,

807
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,870
I want to see where that

808
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,200
thing's moving through the rail network.

809
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,360
And the way I was able to confirm it was,

810
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,530
I was a much younger guy.

811
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,380
I was much more willing
to go ask questions.

812
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,780
There was a rail crew working
in that little mini hut.

813
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,807
I went up and asked them
what they were doing.

814
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:32,510
And they literally were happy to explain,

815
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,290
'Oh yeah, this was an RFID system.

816
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,983
Look, here's the manual you use.'

817
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:39,340
So don't be afraid to ask people
because they typically just

818
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,340
think that you're a hacker spirit.

819
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,730
You just want to learn
how things work, right?

820
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,540
So, but beyond that,

821
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,590
so now a whole bunch of
retailers are using RFID tags to

822
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,160
both combat theft and to make
checking out a way faster.

823
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,220
So I don't know if you've been in a Uniqlo

824
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,693
anytime in the recent couple of years,

825
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,580
But you literally just walk
up to the cash register with

826
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,930
your bundle of clothes
and you just set it down.

827
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,340
And they, they know within like a second,

828
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,470
what it is you got, what sizes they are,

829
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,530
and they tally it all up.

830
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,270
They don't have to scan each one anymore.

831
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,970
It makes things really fast,

832
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:17,803
but

833
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,020
you can get,

834
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,530
so here's some of the Uniqlo tags,

835
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,683
they use three different types
of RFID tags in their stores.

836
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,380
So come back to that in a second,

837
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,365
but you can buy on even
on Amazon right now.

838
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:35,013
Let me see if I have a picture of it.

839
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,940
I do. Okay.

840
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,480
Come back to that a second,
but you can clone RFID, like,

841
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,270
I mean, look at

842
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:48,410
the RFID Thief that Bishop
Fox made many, many years ago.

843
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,823
I'm pretty sure Proxmark3 can do it,

844
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,570
but you can buy just about anything on

845
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,360
AliExpress or Amazon these days.

846
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,603
That's a roll of RFID
tags you can write to,

847
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,350
I think you buy on Amazon for two bucks.

848
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:11,070
So it would be very simple to
encode the EICAR string into

849
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,510
some RFID tags and go see if you could

850
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,660
make things stop working.

851
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,570
Is this shit legal?
Well, I am not a lawyer.

852
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,410
So, but the question really
is what is the legality around

853
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,870
walking around with a giant
barcode on your backpack and

854
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,461
causing random camera systems to crash.

855
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:33,570
I mean, you didn't give
them the permission to

856
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,420
scan your barcode

857
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:38,927
and why should they be scanning
barcodes anyways, right?

858
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,740
But if you decided to start
actively scanning things like

859
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,760
you walk up to the cash register,

860
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,076
you scan it with the EICAR
string and it causes things to

861
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:52,326
crash and they catch on
to what you're doing.

862
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,080
That's probably not going
to work out well for you.

863
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,880
You know, maybe a mischief
charge, computer mischief charge,

864
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,713
who knows.

865
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,660
But do you want to try
it out for yourself?

866
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,740
I mean, how can you do this?

867
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,980
Sticker Mule, love Sticker Mule.

868
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,810
Great place to get small runs
of stickers, done cheaply,

869
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,040
but there are lots of other
sites out there that will do

870
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,190
stickers for you cheap.

871
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,080
Laser labels work great.

872
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,620
Remember QR codes are pretty flexible,

873
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,970
are very fault tolerant as to, you know,

874
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,540
how rough the scan will be,
because you have to remember,

875
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,890
like if you put something on
a UPS package and it crosses

876
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:36,210
miles of conveyor belts, you
know, sometimes those stickers,

877
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,720
those QR codes are going
to get slightly roughed up.

878
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,010
So there's quite a bit of error
correction inside QR codes

879
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,400
to help.

880
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,550
So you can print them
all at home yourself.

881
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,980
So embroidered patches, like I
showed in an earlier picture,

882
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,683
I sell them.

883
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,820
I do not sell them for a lot of money.

884
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,470
I'm not doing this to make money.

885
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,710
Figure out how to find them yourself.

886
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:05,510
So I'm not going to shill
them here, make them yourself.

887
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,640
I can share the design with you.

888
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,800
If you want to make a whole
bunch yourself, reach out to me.

889
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,960
I'll tell you who my
manufacturers overseas

890
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,930
and introduce you to them.

891
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,260
You can make a whole
bunch of patches yourself,

892
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,180
but if you're at DEFCON,
DEFCON proper and not watching

893
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,120
this online, come see me
at the end of the talk.

894
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,060
And I'll give you a patch for free because

895
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,940
I got hundreds of them, hundreds,

896
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,650
and I have a new special
never really seen before and

897
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,880
never released giant

898
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,973
EICAR QR string.

899
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,853
So come on up, see me.

900
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:47,330
And you can get a patch for free.

901
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,560
If you're watching this online,

902
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,810
reach out to me on Twitter or something

903
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,340
and think I'll go create a

904
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,390
special coupon code for you or something.

905
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,060
So with that being said,

906
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,330
as part of the in-person
talk, time for questions.

907
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,130
For the rest of you,

908
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,150
did you find something
interesting trying this out

909
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,820
at home yourself?

910
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,450
Let me know either on Twitter or you can

911
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,420
email at richard@goatse.cx.

912
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,980
Yes, that's my real
email address, goatse.cx.

913
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,660
Some of the old timers will
probably get a kick out of that

914
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,493
email address.

915
00:43:17,493 --> 00:43:21,020
And if you're not a gray beard like me,

916
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:25,053
then don't go looking
up what goatse.cx is.

917
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,210
So thanks for listening.
I really appreciate it.

918
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,940
It was fantastic to be able
to talk to you all today.

919
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,480
And I look forward to
hearing from some of you

920
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,140
in the future.

921
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:36,973
Cheers.
