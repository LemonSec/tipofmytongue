1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,060
- Well, it turns out that
this is what they use.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,540
It's an RFID-based polling system

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,770
that has become increasingly
popular at universities

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,840
due to the ease of conducting attendance

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,850
for even large classes
with hundreds of students.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,600
Every student in the course
will be assigned one of these,

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,470
a remote with a unique identifier

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,630
linked to their student account.

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,110
Then, throughout the lecture,

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,710
instructors will ask
multiple choice questions

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,170
and have students respond

12
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,390
by pressing the corresponding
button on their remote.

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,470
The remote will then
broadcast their answer,

14
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,370
along with their student
ID, back to the base station

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,750
so that after class,

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,080
instructors can generate a
list of students in attendance,

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,140
along with the answer they chose.

18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,860
So, it actually serves a dual purpose,

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,350
both enforcing attendance

20
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,830
by requiring students to actually
show up with their remote,

21
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,540
but also serving as a
small quiz each lecture

22
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,763
to make sure students
are paying attention.
