1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,070
- The most basic thing I can do

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,270
with this time turner
device is just submit a vote

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,010
as if I were using a legitimate remote.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,843
As you can see,

5
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:11,910
the base station here still
can't tell the difference.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,610
Another thing I can do is view
the votes of my classmates.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,270
It might be hard to see this screen,

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,030
but no matter which option I choose

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,590
on this legitimate remote,

10
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,760
it is automatically
displayed on the time turner.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,700
Now, if I were more nefarious,

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,280
what I could do is try to change
the votes of my classmates.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,083
I'm going to restart the poll here,

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,480
and this time, no matter
what my classmate chooses,

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,593
their vote will automatically
be changed to B.

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,683
Let's try picking an answer.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,510
And no matter what I choose,

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,480
it is automatically overwritten
by the time turner device.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,100
Now, a vulnerability
that allows me to change

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,200
someone else's vote on a
so-called polling system

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,460
is a major oversight.

22
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,740
But, if I were more nefarious still,

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,860
I could simply perform a
denial of service attack.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,860
Submitting hundreds of votes per second

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,280
will quickly overwhelm the host device,

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,610
eventually causing it to
crash and making it impossible

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,073
for a legitimate student
to submit their vote.

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,530
Let's restart this poll one last time

29
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,030
to show the most relevant type of attack,

30
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,710
which is simply copying
the most popular vote

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,093
for any given question.

32
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,200
So, I'm going to restart
the polling, and this time,

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,100
the time turner will just copy

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,180
whatever the most popular vote is.

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,170
So, let's say I vote for
A as a legitimate device.

36
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,810
The time turner immediately copies that.

37
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,890
If the most popular vote
changes to something else,

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,430
the time turner will
eventually change its vote,

39
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,363
always making sure to
stay within the majority.
