1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
defcon is going to be weird

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,600
uh this year i mean we all acknowledge

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,680
that but it's going to be weird

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,280
in such a cool way uh for one reason

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,559
specifically and it's

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,320
it is specific to me but it felt like i

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,760
need to share it with you guys and this

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,960
video is going to be a little

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,439
weird i've always tried to be either

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,760
creative or entertaining or

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,640
give a story and this one feels like

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,680
weirdly more

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,960
about me but it i wouldn't have this

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
opportunity if it wasn't for for you and

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,440
watching my channel and spreading my

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,399
videos

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,040
uh so it felt weird not doing this video

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,840
and not

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,800
not sharing it with you i started going

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
to def con

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,399
defcon 16. that's 13 years ago

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,360
i've missed one year it was a year uh

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,160
one or two

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,600
after that and it was my first job

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
my manager decided to go with employees

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,399
i was left behind and i left the job

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,159
actually because of defcon and it's

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,000
insane i've met

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,400
so many friends and def con is going to

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,080
be weird this year because some of them

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
aren't going to be going uh but it's

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,880
gonna

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
probably feel more like an intimate con

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
but the thing that makes this

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,479
khan so much different this year

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,680
is because i'm gooning and what a goon

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,560
is if you don't know

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,000
is it's staff and it's not like staff at

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,280
a workplace where you apply

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
and defcon gooning is beyond that it's

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,439
something you're asked

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,479
to do and i was asked to do

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,840
video specifically bring the

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,799
in-person conference uh to you guys who

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,920
might be

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,360
virtual and not be able to make it and

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,880
it's such a um it's it's overwhelming

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,079
uh because it happened because of of you

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,439
sharing the videos it was the urinal

50
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,360
cake video it's the defcon urinal cake

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,479
video i did

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,520
which was one of the first ones i i ever

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,000
did on my channel i've had to learn

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,520
editing and video and

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
lighting and i'm still like bumbling my

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
way through it

57

97
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,360

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,600
but

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
in darknet is is the biggest conference

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,280
at defcon

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,479
which is a really big conference and i

124
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,840
always looked at goons

125
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,199
as these people who helped run the

126
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,919
conference

127
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,240
and gave so much of themselves to make

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,960
it

129
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,560
so great uh grifter running contests and

130
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,320
i mean all the contest

131
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
runners are just so amazing bringing so

132
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
much joy

133
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,720
but staff always seemed to make it was

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,240
what brought the conference together

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,560
kept it running everything from

136
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
skyria when she was working in

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,040
production

138
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,280
making sure water was filled at all the

139
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
areas for all of us

140
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
uh but yikes it's just thinking through

141
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,840
the conference there's so many moving

142
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,039
pieces

143
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
but spinning back to this channel i made

144
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,400
this channel

145
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,639
uh last year i think it was around like

146
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,320
november i did a

147
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,800
course uh which just helped jumpstart it

148
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,960
and started pumping out videos and where

149
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
it is now

150
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,440
is never where i expected it to be i

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,560
expected it to

152
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
you know get some views and i i went

153
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,639
into it thinking i was going to do

154
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,720
uh penetration testing and hacking

155
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,199
tutorials like a john hammond or uh

156
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,240
um a cryptocat who's just like they're

157
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,720
so

158
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,080
they're so good at what they do and if

159
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,199
you haven't seen their channels and

160
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,880
you're into technical like go

161
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
go check out them out like they're

162
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,160

163
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
content

164
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,240
but it shifted my channel shifted when i

165
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,360
introduced

166
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,759

167
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,639

sharing stories and you all have been

171
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,120
there while i've been growing this

172
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,600
channel and it's not big but i don't

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,360
care it's not that's not my goal like i

174
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
don't need this to

175
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
to make money i run a business i own the

176
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,880
business so

177
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,120
i wanted this to grow a community and

178
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,160
interact with you

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,199
and i get i got that opportunity

180
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
a few weeks ago uh defcon reached out

181
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,319
they asked me if i want what my plans

182
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:24,800
were

183
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,840
for the conference and i said i want

184
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,199
to make videos of a conference i want to

185
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,160
bring this this weird year this just

186
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,600
screwy year

187
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,479
of between covet and virtual and in

188
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,759
person and

189
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,520
uh some things are remote some things

190
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
are virtual but i

191
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,080
wanted to bring that that joy and again

192
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,280
i thought it was going to be a full

193
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,080
conference when

194
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
i kind of like harebrained scheme this

195
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,840
thing together

196
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
but with it going virtual i felt like

197
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840
that that pull even more

198
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
to to bring this the in-person

199
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
conference virtual and take video but i

200
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,319
was so nervous about it because

201
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,599
defcon is is very private

202
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,759
and and people are very security

203
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,960
conscious so i was

204
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,440
i was unsure and i shared that with them

205
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,599
and they were they were encouraging i

206
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:13,919
got

207
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,199
introduced to other goons uh who

208
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,400
who have just talked to me and rallied

209
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,199
and

210
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,160
encouraged me and that so that's what

211
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,680
i'm doing this year i'm going to the

212
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,880
conference

213
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,280
do just sharing it and the question is

214
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,000
like what does this mean

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,599
what what does this mean for you the

216
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,599
viewer uh it's gonna

217
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,240
it's we're we're getting weird that's

218
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,919
what it is we're getting weird

219
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
uh you're probably gonna get more videos

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,280
like this like you'll notice there's no

221
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
cuts here like this is this is

222
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,840
this is raw um raw and un

223
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,160
uncut probably not the best thing to

224
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,080
probably do at def con but uh we'll

225
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,960
we'll try

226
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,199
and uh that's what's gonna happen like

227
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,720
the next two weeks stefcon goes from

228
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,599
like the fourth

229
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,840
to the eighth i'm gonna hit the ground

230
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,800
i'm gonna try

231
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
all sorts of content everything from

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,479
shorts to like vloggy like content

233
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,479

234
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,680
the conference

235
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560

236
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,520
can

237
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
some of the videos are going to be

238
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,479
edited some aren't i just want to

239
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,919
introduce you to certain

240
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,520
different areas around the conference so

241
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,680
like whether it's the chill out lounge

242
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,840
whether it's the artists i would love to

243
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,319
have you guys meet the other goons

244
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,720
in and interview them so i don't know

245
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,319
where the content's gonna go

246
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,360
i just wanted you guys to know uh it's

247
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,799
gonna get weird

248
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,599
i'm gonna shove out content where i can

249
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,240
but but

250
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,958
mostly i wanted to make this video to

251
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,679
let you know

252
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
that i'm gooning which i'm just pumped

253
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,958
about it and

254
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,399
in the channel is going to get weird for

255
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,160
a little bit and then we'll kind of get

256
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,640
into a little bit of a rhythm afterwards

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:48,959
i'll

258
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,880
have some b-roll and i'm sure we'll have

259
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
tons to talk about

260
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399

261
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
