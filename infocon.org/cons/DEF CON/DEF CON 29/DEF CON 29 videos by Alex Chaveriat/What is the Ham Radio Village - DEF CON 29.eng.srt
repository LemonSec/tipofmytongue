1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
i am at the ham radio village and it is

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,120
tucked back in a corner right around

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,240
hardware hacking and i had to jump on

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,960
over to hear about what it all is about

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,440
now ham radio has been around i think a

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,839
long time a little over 100 years over a

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,560
hundred years but specifically at the

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,760
village can you just tell me a little

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,400
bit about like what is ham radio and i

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,960
know that's like a big conversation but

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,599
like technically like what is it like am

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,519
fm radio type of thing or so ham radio

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
basically the license it gets you the

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,880
catalyst to do whatever you want on a

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,640
huge amount of frequencies dedicated for

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,719
just hams so from as low as 200 and 2

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,840
200 meters long wavelengths to 900 or

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,120
1400 megahertz you can do basically

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,039
a bunch of experimentation talking to

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,280
people sending packets a bunch of fun on

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,360
these frequencies just for hammers and

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
yeah you can do frequency stuff without

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,440
a license but with ham radio you can do

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,359
a lot higher power stuff so you can get

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,120
farther and longer distances and have

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
more fun so like you you said like uh

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,040
frequencies and things like that it's

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,360
all talking right like i'm gonna tune

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
into my frequency and i broadcast my

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,080
voice across for other people here yeah

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
well so you can't talk to people so like

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,200
with stuff like a handheld you can talk

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
to people in your local area or with

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,720
using repeaters you can go farther but

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,320
there's also digital modes and packing

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
modes such as aprs which can beacon

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,680
locations to be seen all around the

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,520
world so if you don't like talking to

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,759
people there's digital modes like packet

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,360
and if you like talking to people sweet

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
and there's also experimentation stuff

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,840
too like drone pilots who do fpv racing

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
they use 900 megahertz and a ham radio

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,520
license to be able to fly farther

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,640
because they can transmit a higher

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
powers with the license oh that's so

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
cool so it's not even just like just for

48
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,159
talking but there's like you can use

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,960
your frequency for whatever you want

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,840
so

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
at the ham radio village like when

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,000
you're it seems like there's a ton of

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,360
people in there just talking as a

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,399
community

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
is ham radio more about like getting

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
your voice out and getting creative or

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
is it a lot of community based things

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,840
where you want to meet that it really is

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
it is honestly it's about community it's

60
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,840
about meeting people literally we are

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,439
all about getting people in groups and

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,758
clubs it is family friendly my family of

63
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,840
four we all got it literally same day

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,760
and we went to ham day field day

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,840
together we streamed we did all these

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
things it is about getting to know your

67
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,040
community it's also about getting to

68
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,640
know people around the world this is an

69
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,040
international thing so can you how far

70
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,400
does ham radio go you said it's

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,239
international international yeah if the

72
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,000

countries you can stream to anybody

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,360
there's these free software's online you

75
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,959
can get on your computer you can project

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,720

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
so many people going in i see another

79
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,440
room which is ham radio exams

80
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,959
at def con

81
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,879
you can study and actually like get your

82
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,280
ham radio license absolutely yesterday i

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
had a study chain of 90 plus people for

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
three plus hours they were helping each

85
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,239
other out i was getting them registered

86
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,519
and they were popping in and i get

87
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,959
people walking out i'm a general i

88
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
didn't even think i could get tick oh

89
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,760
it's so cool like it's so easy and fun

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
oh that's awesome like what are some of

91
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
the coolest uses of ham radio that

92
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,800
you've seen it really depends on your

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,239
use case and if you like talking to

94
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,440
people you can talk to people from all

95
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,800
around the world a couple weeks ago i

96
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
talked to some folks in cuba down south

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
america and saudi arabia or you can just

98
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,560
send messages through aprs or modes like

99
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,239
bpsk31 which is basically texting using

100
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,000
ham radio and you can just talk to

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,200
people all around the world see how the

102
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,760
weather is there or spread information

103
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,120
and there's so much experimenting you

104
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
can do everything in ham radio is done

105
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,519
by hands and forehands it's very much

106
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
volunteer base so it's catered just

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
towards hams this whole community that's

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,080
so cool so like last question which is

109
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,120
if they come to defcon next year how

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,159
much does it cost to get registered and

111
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,040
go do the exam it is free 93 honey

112
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,280
that's awesome so you can come here you

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
can study have the support of the sport

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
of everyone who's working the contest

115
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,920
area and then you go and get your free

116
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,760
that's awesome absolutely all right one

117
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
more question because i have to know if

118
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
i got into ham radio what's like the

119
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
cost entry for like

120
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
like a simple rig to start getting

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
involved so yeah the cheapest radios are

122
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,040
basically around thirty dollars and

123
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,000
those are

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,599
by brands such as battlefin and they're

125
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,120
well known people you usually get them

126
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
from amazon and then from there you can

127
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
get more expensive handhelds they start

128
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
at around 60 to 100 and the nice price

129
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,680
the next price bracket is around 200.

130
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,639
and then once you get your higher

131
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,079
licenses you can get the bigger more

132
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,600
fancy radios and that typically start

133
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,759
about 500 and up i would say and that's

134
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,639
brand new so not used man so the cost of

135
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,400
entry is not that hot what are you gonna

136
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
say or you can go to swap meets i had a

137
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
guy who told me he got a 2500 rig for 20

138
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,400
bucks because someone was giving it away

139
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
to swap me that's awesome

140
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
i mean one thing we find out within

141
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
hardware is like tends to people the

142
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
