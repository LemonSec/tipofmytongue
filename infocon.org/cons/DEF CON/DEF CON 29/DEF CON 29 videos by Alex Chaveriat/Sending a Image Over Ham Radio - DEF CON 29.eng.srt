we are back in the ham radio village and

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,319
something we talked about in our last

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,240
video was the ability not just to

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,280
broadcast your voice but actually data

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,960
across would it be this

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,719
is the radio spectrum all right it's not

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,519
the spectrum tubes no not the spectrum

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,480

the ham radio through the wire into the

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,719

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,840
loading piece by piece

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
that is absolutely incredible it's not

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
something i would expect ham radio to be

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,280
able to do yeah i know with just a phone

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
app and a little handheld radio you can

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
send photos or memes or anything you

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,720
want to all your friends on ham radio i

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
mean no one on ham radio would ever send

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,799
a meme it's always very serious things

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,720
right yeah typically it's always very

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,880
serious matters nothing very fishy going

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
on but yeah i know you can send whatever

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,600
