1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,480
what happened right after we described

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,600
the first hat

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
was they started accusingly pointing at

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,120
each other finding out

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,200
who who was the one who just started all

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,800
the monstrosities

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,759
and they all pointed to this man right

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,200
here and what's your hand

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,359
uh i'm mr bell mr bill

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,480
i know mr bill oh yeah

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,640
man so okay so how did the whole thing

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
start um

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,920
so i saw jrwr's hat chan

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,719
which is the pith helmet with leds on it

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,239
and one day i was just sitting at my

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,680
desk and

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,520
i had an old hard hat that my son had

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,840
left behind and i had a raspberry pi

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,200
screen it was one of those little three

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,239
and a half inch

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,239
screens and i was like hey this one this

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,600
would look really cool on the front of a

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,480
hard hat

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,520
what can i do with it and the idea kind

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,320
of grew from that

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,600
and so then i built a hard hat that ran

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
kismet wireless had a much bigger screen

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,559
everything was on the outside

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,040
and i've run that for a couple years and

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
two years ago we had an unofficial

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,520
contest

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
for hard hats the hard hat or the

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,799
homebrew hardware packing uh contest

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
folks allowed us to share some stage

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,479
space

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,600
and we had quite a few entries and

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,320
you know kind of grew out of that have

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,799
you ever

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,479
published any of the information that

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,799
has come from your hard hat

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,119
like online just how many access points

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,040
how many connections

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,960
well so as far as the wi-fi goes not

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
every hard hat does wi-fi if you go to

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
our twitter account hard hat brigade

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,799
uh you'll see the entries from two years

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,600
ago um we had two categories one was

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,399
bling

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,200
which is anything flashy right uh and

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,560
then the other category was

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,640
where's which is it had to have some

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,000
sort of functionality

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,240
some of the hats were really artistic we

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,119
had like

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,920
a paper horse with a hand pulled fiber

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
optic

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
we had a hard hat that was you know

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,119
another fiber optic

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,000
hard hat that was painted lots of lights

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and bling

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,599
and then the hard hat that we chose as

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,080
the overall winner was shelley which was

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,599
made by strath

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,640
which was an rc car with of course it

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
was bedazzled

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
and had leds all over it and if i

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,319
remember correctly it was sniffing

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,440
bluetooth

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,640
and also the logitech

70
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,680
keyboard keystrokes basically

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,840
and so that was the right combination of

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
both categories

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,519
oh that's so cool so how many years has

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,000
it been going on total

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
um so i've had my original hat for i

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
think this would be

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
my fourth year um like i said in

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,720
2019 we ran an unofficial defcon contest

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
just for fun

80
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,200
uh we had 16 entries so you know it's

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,720
been a couple years and it's kind of

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,239
growing in interest because

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,519
hard hats are cheap you know there's a

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,040
lot of fun things you can do with them

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,680
and it's a great conversation piece so

86
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,920
out of all the ones that you've seen up

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,280
to this point

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,360
can you tell me like maybe your top

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
three ones that come to mind it's just

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
something innovative

91
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,159
something that isn't just like blinky

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,319
leds but something that like goes beyond

93
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,120
like

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
beyond like what you would expect in a

95
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
hard hat system

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,720
um that's really difficult to say

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
because one of the reasons why

98
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,239
we kind of started hardhat brigade was

99
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,840
to encourage other people to

100
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,280
build things and try things out and

101
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,440
you know actually one of the most moving

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
stories was one of the contestants

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
uh from 2019 told us that he had not

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,519
touched a soldering iron in 20 years

105
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,159
and this encouraged him to actually

106
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,760
start building things again

107
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,799
and i mean that i'm getting the chills

108
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,159
thinking about it that's the type of

109
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,879
thing that

110
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,319
you know hardhat brigade's about it's

111
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,879
not about it's not about the best

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,560
when i mean obviously with the contest

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,000
we had to decide

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,439
but um you know each hat is unique

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,319
and everybody has a story and and it's

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
you know it's always a journey

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,080
so yeah it's very difficult yeah that

118
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,439
i mean that's what we love about def con

119
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,360
that's what we absolutely love about def

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,079
con

121
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,560
is both like challenging for the the

122
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,839
people have been doing it for a long

123
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,478
time but just

124
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,720
like inviting the community just to

125
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,759
participate

126
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,440
and just find joy in just the most

127
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
ridiculous obnoxious ways like this is

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,960
awesome like looking around the table

129
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,479
you see and i'll again i'll put some

130
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,320
b-roll in so you guys can see it

131
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,960
just so many cool hard hats that they've

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,800
thrown together with all this cool

133
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
functionality
