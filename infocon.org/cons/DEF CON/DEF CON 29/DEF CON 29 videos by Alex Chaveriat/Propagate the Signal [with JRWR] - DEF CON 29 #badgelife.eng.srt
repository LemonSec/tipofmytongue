00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
i am here with jrwr who walked up to me

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,080
wanting to pair with my badge and then

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,680
he talked about something pretty

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,440
incredible he's doing with the badge

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,120
right now can you tell us a little bit

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,880
about it sure so what i'm doing is i

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
wrote a little script that will take

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,359
your badge and connect it to my computer

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,359
and then the badges have these front

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
codes that you can share

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,720
responses with so you can pair with

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,880
other people across the internet so i

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
wrote a web interface for it and then so

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,640
anybody anybody's badge that i've

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
connected to i post the url into the

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,360
into the defcon discord and then

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,280
hundreds of people can magically start

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
pairing with badges now

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,160
and so i've been doing that with goon

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,640
badges artist badges anything i can get

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,360
my hands on pretty much

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,640
because of me we've been definitely

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,440
propagating the signal as best we can

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,879
and we're doing a lot of research into

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,960
the badges now i've been sharing the

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
code we have a couple other people doing

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,520
this as well with the node sharing

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
and then

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,359
we also have a botnet that we're forming

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,760
so as soon as it joins rc channel it it

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,520
spawns uh connections to all of the

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,519
other bots and gets their codes oh

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
that's so cool so yeah

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,840
