french breasts and i had my coffee but i

53

to hit the conference floor i

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
i i that was like my morning and then

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
all of a sudden gallery was like hey you

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
know what we should do we should do the

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
pool party and you could shoot it then

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,880
the next that night he's like you could

80
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,160
also go and like

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
jump in the pool and it's like

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
3 a.m and yeah you just you wrecked my

83
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,400
sleep at the conference

84
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,360
yeah so so for for viewers who have not

85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
gone and have not experienced it there's

86
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,280
a there's a three two one rule for a

87
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,600
reason which is three hours of sleep two

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,880
meals a day one shower a day and uh

89
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,960
yeah that you know the three hours of

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
sleep

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
sometimes it's adhered to

92
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,479
like it's a it's more of a

93
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,560
recommendation it's more of a guideline

94
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,919
than a rule

95
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,320
it generally happens in the wee hours of

96
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,120
the morning between like 6 a.m and 9 00

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,160
a.m

98
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
really that's why they don't have the

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
talks and conferences starting until 10

100
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,560
o'clock right

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,960
oh gosh oh that's a good question that's

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,919
a great question could you ex explain

103
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
your defcon experience in one word

104
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
sometime saturday night and i had the

169
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,479
cave

170
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,199
only gulo could go to defcon virtually

171
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,360
and still smell it

172
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
like i i was thinking to myself it's

173
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,879
like

174
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,280
knowing gullo's challenges and knowing

175
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,919
the one-way hash role that he did it was

176
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,440
poop by the way it's totally poop it's

177
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,760
always poop uh is i'm wondering i could

178
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,599
just imagine him going you know i have a

179
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,679
great challenge and then realizing he

180
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,320
just gooned himself there he's like i

181
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
got a challenge for you guys oh crap

182
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,120
this backfired really hard

183
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
you got gas masks i'm good

184
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,320
that was like the hardest part at

185
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,480
conference this year for me was like

186
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
audio like i think we we got a good

187
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
groove about halfway through of how to

188
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
do the audio for videos

189
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,959
but yeah some people were wearing masks

190
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,480
some people wearing two masks some

191
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,279
people wearing a matte like a gas mask

192
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,360
and it was remarkably hard to capture

193
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,200
good audio there

194
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
for what it's worth i think you did a

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
fantastic job

196
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,279
they're giving your microphone

197
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,360
you lick your microphone you slide it

198
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
inside their mask

199
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
and then they talk and then you can

200
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,550
remove it

201
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,800
[Laughter]

202
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,399
incredible

203
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,360
uh so uh what i what i really want to

204
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,200
hear is because i think the viewers got

205
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
a chance to see a bunch of silk and i

206
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,399
throughout the conference and as we're

207
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,920
posting more videos

208
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,480
i feel like i missed out on an entire

209
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
conference online

210
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
so i want to hear what the hell happened

211
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
online because there was a whole we

212
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
talked about this before it felt like

213
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,160
there were two conferences happening and

214
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
or were going to happen and as it turns

215
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,240
out that's effectively what happened

216
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,080
there were two conferences so i want to

217
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,360

218
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000

224
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
and gary just brought up a good point

225
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,480
which was it felt like two conferences

226
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,640
was one in one and we missed like half

227
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
of it so gator over to you what was

228
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,079
virtual like

229
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,959
so

230
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,160
virtual first day

231
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
was quiet because we didn't have our

232
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
contest start until friday and i will

233
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,680
tell you what i had fomo pretty damn

234
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,839
hard because i'm seeing people do stuff

235
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,560
online i'm seeing the talks go on online

236
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
i'm seeing a lot everybody's psyched

237
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,519
actually getting through the lines and

238
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,320
getting into def con itself uh

239
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,279
by

240
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,480
friday night

241
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,839
when we went through we had been open

242
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,880
for the entire day uh then we had been

243
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,079
able to go join a couple of the

244
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,480
different virtual artists and then

245
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,800
seeing the size of the rooms of people

246
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
there in vegas going through and

247
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,800
partying and

248
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
rocking out to whatever artist was that

249
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
night my fomo started to die down a bit

250
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,519
for the positive side the technical

251
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,519
talks that were being streamed

252
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,200
didn't have nearly as many issues as

253
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
there were in the past so that was

254
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,120
fantastic so many different channels for

255
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,920
you to be able to tune into

256
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
the live soma fm i would say was

257
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
actually the thing that had the most

258
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
hiccups compared to the talks that were

259
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
given the talks were just smooth one

260
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,000
right after another no problems uh for

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,399
the second year of being online i will

262
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,640
say that defcon really tuned in how and

263
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,000
where they're having people interact

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,720
with folks uh inside a discord and the

265
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,760
same goes for the villages too i

266
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,240
pretty butter smooth i did not get a

267
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,680
chance to be able to attend any

268
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,519
workshops this time around with that i

269
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,200
can actually hand it over to gulo and

270
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
google can talk about it

271
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
yeah i got butt hurt

272
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,720

290
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
past couple years like we kind of

291
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,680
the def con 28 and it's like this hybrid

298

moaning mark

299
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,040

303
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,839
hey so

304
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,720

305
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,519
yeah you you were off by one

306
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,680
20. you know 28 was set yeah 28 was safe

307
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,920
mode

308

28 29. okay this is what prep this is

309
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,120
what def con does too drinking

310
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,200
on the in-person side i will tell you

311
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,839
so i well let's start with like the not

312
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,800
so good the conference was small it was

313
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,360
legitimately small um you know it was

314
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,920
basically two major big rooms and then a

315
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,240
couple of villages all you know put off

316
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,880
to the side and stuff and

317
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
you you could tell it was palpable it

318
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,600
was not the same as a previous as

319
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,680
previous conferences like you could you

320
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,079
could make the rounds in one day and see

321
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,120
pretty much everything that there was

322
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,199
there and that that was okay that was

323
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,920
actually kind of nice in some senses

324
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,199
but

325
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,680
um you know you got to do some funky

326
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,360
things some fun things like they had the

327
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,839
the paper airplane uh you know village

328
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,160
thing inside of the aerospace village

329
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,839
and that was nice and it was definitely

330
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,920
a i think i think it would be nice in

331
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
future years uh

332
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,000
because they had that space this year to

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,240
do that it definitely gave people

334
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,839
creative thoughts where the aerospace

335
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,920
village was like how do we turn this

336
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
into a contest and how do we add you

337
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
know legitimate hacking into it and how

338
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,079
do we you know i think it would be

339
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,240
really cool if we were like you know

340
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
hacker paper airplanes where there's

341
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,079
actual you know

342
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,160
hardware components to it and who can

343
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
get the furthest or who can get it

344
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,839
autonomous or who can get something like

345
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,839
that but it has to primarily be made out

346
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,720
of paper and maybe they use like uh i

347
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,839
don't know

348
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,199
things that we're thinking about in the

349
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,639
future would be fun

350
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,800
i

351
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
the contest i was laughing because we

352
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,399
did so we did a video on that one but

353
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,360
the one that won again they weren't like

354
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,639
they were saying like which one went

355
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,320
well and which one went furthest but the

356
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
one that that one

357
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,079
wasn't an airplane they just made a

358
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,120
javelin out of it and just javelined it

359
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,279
across and at one point they're like

360
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,040
okay we're gonna hurt someone with these

361
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,120
so they put up nets on both sides or at

362
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
least on one side so it wouldn't fly

363
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
into people at the car hacking village

364
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,399
but it was

365
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,600
yeah i i agree with gauri like it was it

366
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,759
was very different this year uh i i

367
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,399
wasn't defcon 16 was my first so i don't

368
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,360
go back to like the alexis park days but

369
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
it it was only like i think they ended

370
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,959
up announcing it was like right around 8

371
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,440
300 people it didn't feel like that

372
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,839
because it was in paris valleys which we

373
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
have had conferences up to like 30 000

374
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
in that space

375
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,519
so

376
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
having it at 68 like you weren't bumping

377
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,839
into people in the hallways uh you had a

378
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,079
lot of space even like at the conference

379
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,480
the vendor area like six vendors pulled

380
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,560
out last minute so they had space

381
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,160
available and they didn't close off the

382
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,639
room so there's only like

383
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,839
four

384
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,000
yeah there was five and and to give

385
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
people to give people context and prior

386
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,560
conferences it was 55 vendors so

387
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,399
one tenth of the vendors showed up so

388
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,480
when i say it was small like

389
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,560
you could

390
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,959
you could stay socially distanced from

391
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,759
people at this defcon like it would not

392
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,360
have been hard for you to stay six feet

393
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,279
away from people and and maintain your

394
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,800
distance maybe going through some of the

395
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
choke points going through some of the

396
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,759
doors that would you know you'd have had

397
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,839
a hard time but for the most part

398
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,480
you were not crammed in and there was no

399
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,639
like traffic jams on the way between

400
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,720
valleys and paris right like

401
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
no goons having to tell people to stay

402
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,160
in line stay to the right

403
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
there was a swag line at the beginning

404
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,160
on friday and and then that resolved

405
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,079
and that was it or thursday whatever it

406
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,519
was thursday there was a swag line on

407
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,839
thursday and then like there was no swag

408
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,280
line after that you just walk up to the

409
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
swag table

410
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,679
which is

411
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,160
for anyone who's been that is maybe 300

412
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,959
people

413
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,120
like

414
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,720
god

415
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,799
8 300 people sounds more like the

416
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,880
riviera

417
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,679
and then i did see in the vendor area

418
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,959
uh that keyport was there and i actually

419
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,360
really love that vendor because i

420
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
have to every year that i see them i

421
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,679
have to get new keys because i've moved

422
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,360
someplace new

423
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,280
yep and i didn't think that i moved

424
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,440
every year but every time i go to defcon

425
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,919
i have to get a new settings because i

426
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,280
moved again

427
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,039
so i went and did the same thing there

428
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,600
gulo i just bought remotely and i got my

429
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,039
new side

430
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,039
channel as well so that's cool have

431
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,960
other ones from last year so i've got

432
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,799
two or three of their versions

433
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,000
of kits so i finally got my thumb drive

434
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,559
and i got their sim uh kit that you're

435
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
able to also plug in so i've been a big

436
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,000
fan of those especially since there's no

437
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,760
jingle in your pocket now which is

438
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,280
fantastic

439
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
yep i've got that plastic one as well

440
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,240
yeah

441
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,160
hacker warehouse was the i got the slide

442
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,720
one um

443
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,039
i get the slide one i haven't done it

444
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,200
remotely because i'm really not a fan of

445
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,520
taking photos of my keys and then

446
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,799
sending them to a third party so that's

447
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,440
why i like this to be honest

448
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,880
it's because this i'm not going to open

449
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,679
them up but this one you literally uh

450
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,400
use a a screwdriver to undo and you just

451
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,640
put your full-size key inside which is

452
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
great so i'm not sending pictures of it

453
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,160
so the thing that i'd like to go through

454
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,960
and do

455
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,600
on top of that is i also like to add a

456
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
yubi key so then i've got a yubikey and

457
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,679
now a thumb drive always with me no

458
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
jingles so i would get i upgraded get so

459
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
much trouble doing that like i would

460
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,880
forget it was there all the time

461
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,360
right right absolutely depending on

462
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,480
where you work you may or may not be

463
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,080
able to do that

464
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,160
so before we get into the good and the

465
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
awesome if you will let's talk about the

466
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
bad like the truly bad part and it has

467
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,039
actually i don't think there was a bad

468
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,360
part about def con not really what was

469
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,240
bad

470
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,600
was black hat

471
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
because every single person that i

472
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,880
talked to who attended black hat said

473
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,520
almost the same thing which was that was

474
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,200
not a conference

475
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,960
yeah right i heard i heard the same

476
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
thing everything anything about i heard

477
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,880
anything i heard about black hat was

478
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,000
like it ruined the ruin the conference

479
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,320
from it like ruined the whole like even

480
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,919
def con like you you just like you know

481
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,000
you get energized at that thing and you

482
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,400
just got that slog from black hat that

483
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
kind of just moved into the conference

484
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
it was weird

485
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
i i really well

486
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
full disclosure i don't think any of us

487
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,440
attended black hat so we're hearing this

488
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,880
and we're saying you know second-hand

489
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,360
information so take it for what you

490
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,679
will but the folks that i talked to who

491
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,280
attended said that

492
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,120
the way they did their talks was one it

493
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,440
was fully virtual and to well fully

494
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,880
virtual but you couldn't watch them

495
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,799
online you had to go to the conference

496
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,039
but none of the speakers were present so

497
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,360
you walked into yeah you walked into a

498
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,080
room you sat down and you watched tv

499
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,640
screens and the oh no

500
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,760
and it was not recorded

501
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,600
so gross right and so on top of that

502
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,840
some of the folks uh what was it i think

503
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,159
it was like eight or

504
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,240
almost all of uh the government

505
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,600
presenters and the government people are

506
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
supposed to show up which is a normal

507
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,640
which is normal for black hat because

508
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
it's the the more you know professional

509
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,520
of the two quote unquote uh they all

510
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,280
pulled out last minute due to covid

511
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,440
which is fine which is totally fine but

512
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,840
like that really apparently like just

513
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,159
cut their content in half or what their

514
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
on-site events were going to be in half

515
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
um and that's that's unfortunate because

516
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
that's not necessarily about black hat's

517
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,679
fault

518
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,039
but then like

519
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,120
it was essentially like show up and talk

520
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,880
to vendors and that was the conference

521
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
which is not a conference

522
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,480
automatic conference yeah

523
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,240
uh so that that is for people that went

524
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
from black hot to defcon i had to say

525
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,039
the same thing with uh with silk said

526
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,960
which is it set the tone for their whole

527
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
week and you know they basically just

528
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
weren't happy which i feel really bad

529
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
for those folks and i feel a little bad

530
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,039
for black hat having so many people pull

531
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,360
out but at the same time like

532
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,919
that sucks like i just heard it was not

533
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,600
a conference

534
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,840
so i got the opportunity with my

535
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,520
employer to uh

536
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
go and attend virtually not in person so

537
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,840
it was the first time ever attending

538
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,919
online and

539
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,320
i will say the talks online were fine

540
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
there was a limited amount that we could

541
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,080
go see um versus having the entire thing

542
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,200
open to us

543
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
the keynote when they were talking with

544
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,760
sisa and the new leader which is uh jen

545
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,200
easterly was actually an interesting

546
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
about our

547
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,000
interview slash deep dive into her

548
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,559
background and where she's trying to go

549
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,280
with cesa um

550
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,600
it was worthwhile in my opinion um i

551
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
didn't get to see very many of the other

552
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,360
talks that were going on that was one of

553
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
them that i was able to see

554
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,320
um

555
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
and she's a geek at heart which is

556
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,799
awesome she's been uh she was going

557
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,640
through and playing with her rubik's

558
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,360
cube there on stage and whatnot but

559
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,559
seeing her background it seems like

560
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,600
she's a little bit more in touch with

561
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
where we're at

562
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,400
and how

563
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,880
we as a community need more people

564
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,240
especially in

565
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,720
government positions to say hey this is

566
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,400
how things actually work versus

567
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,159
just your techno babble and passing

568
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,919
bills so

569
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,760
that's a that's a little bit hopeful in

570
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
my opinion so that was one good thing

571
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,480
that i had seen virtually at uh black

572
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,520
hat

573
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
that's good but didn't know about that

574
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,159
in person

575
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,400
yeah i did hear that a handful of the

576
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
talks were good um from folks who were

577
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,320
on the ground that that's you know

578
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
actually sat through it so i'm not

579
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,039
saying the content that was there was

580
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,480
bad i'm just saying that the overall

581
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,320
conference that was i heard it was not

582
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
good so silk you had something yeah i

583
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
was i uh gator brought up a good point

584
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
which was i i was actually looking

585
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,159
forward to the the keynote at def con

586
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,120
again they pulled out coved

587
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,360
all good not just but my point was i was

588
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,480
kind of looking forward because i was

589
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,520
really curious because it was going to

590
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,559
be like a

591
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,280
uh interview style with dt and i was

592
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,640
really curious where that was going to

593
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,000
go i i disagree i think there was it was

594
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,600
uh unavoidable downside to defcon there

595
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,559
was pros and cons to this one which was

596
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,720
and it it's gonna tie back to the video

597
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
i do plan to do at one point which was

598
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,559
the people like there was there was

599
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,880
because there was there was so every

600
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
contest i knew of

601
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,720
whether it was hack fortress whether it

602
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,520
was scav hunt uh there was people

603
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,919
missing and like notable people who i've

604
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,120
known since oakland for 10 years going

605
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,799
to def gun seeing them

606
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,559
and they weren't there

607
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,720
and it threw off some of my vibe of

608
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,320
hanging out with people and seeing them

609
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,400
here like i had plans to do interviews

610
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,240
and again my planning kind of went out

611
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,799
the window for a lot of reasons but that

612
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,240
was the thing in some ways it was really

613
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,760
cool i got to go to the pool party for

614
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,279
the first time

615
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,039
the pool was half empty which was

616
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,120
amazing like i don't know how it

617
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,679
normally is like fuzzy knop was just

618
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,960
like

619
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,159
decimating uh djing like it was so cool

620
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,919
just to see people dancing and the

621
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,240
lights and def con did not pull any

622
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,559
stops like they didn't like they

623
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,039
they had the lighting audio they didn't

624
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:35,760
like

625
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,000
screw the defcon attendees by going ah

626
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
there's not gonna be as many people here

627
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,159
like it was smaller but it was that was

628
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,440
like a huge downside to me was it it was

629
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,039
split and there was no we talked about

630
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,799
this on stream before there was no

631
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,799
winning here it was going to be if it's

632
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,240
hybrid you have ha i had serious fomo

633
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
missing out on all the virtual stuff

634
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,559
going on and then i'm guessing anyone

635
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,919
who was virtual is like what am i

636
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,760
missing out in person

637
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,840
uh the talks weren't like i didn't go to

638
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
any talks this year they were all

639
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,880
virtual which is great because i could

640
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,919
watch them now but i think like the some

641
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,279
of the impromptu stuff was kind of uh

642
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,000
missed we'll say but yeah it was um

643
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,600
defcon 30 i am really looking forward to

644
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,880
go ahead gulo

645
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,080

646
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,120
people of where are you at we need to go

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,200
defcon circus clown oh

654
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,559
finally

655
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,720
on the stealing front uh we were talking

656
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,520
with skyria and they were cleaning up

657
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,720
the conference

658
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,240
and we're talking to the quartermaster

659
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,960
and we're not talking to the

660
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
cornermaster but she was talking to the

661
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,080
quartermaster as they're cleaning

662
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,760
everything up and everything

663
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,000
and they make

664
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,760
the quartermaster goes

665
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,960
huh

666
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,600
no one stole anything this year

667
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,919
so now we know

668
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:08,880
why

669
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,039
and it's probably because gulo was not

670
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
present at defcon 29

671
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
everything is going to turn to the

672
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,960
quartermaster i'm i'm countering this

673
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,279
though uh talking with all the sock

674
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,039
goons they're like it was a boring year

675
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,200
nothing was stolen like no massive

676
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,039
fights girl like i always had to laugh

677
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,440
like the goons that run the sock are

678
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
always like

679
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
nothing happened like nothing terrible

680
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,279
happened that we were needed for

681
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,840
minus one thing which i wish i had the

682
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,600
video prepped

683
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
car hacking village

684
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,240
yeah sudden

685
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,320
one all of a sudden a group formed

686
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,559
around one of the cars and at the same

687
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,559
time five people started distracting all

688
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,679
the goons inside the car hacking village

689
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,440
the car was lifted up by the group and

690
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,799
started getting moved outside the room

691
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,120
they got it all the way outside

692
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,000
to registration when a goon promptly

693
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,159
said what are you guys doing drop it in

694
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,279
all scattered

695
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,880
we'll have to find the video because

696
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,120
it's hilarious oh yeah well it's it's on

700
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,399

the there was a kiddie pool full of

714
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
oatmeal that appeared at some point and

715
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,440
no one knows why

716
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,320

yeah there's pictures there's pictures

719
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,559
it was dealt with but it showed up over

720
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,200
in the same area and it was over towards

721
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,320
hacker jeopardy and no one can explain

722
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,120
the

723
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,360
oatmeal filled kiddie pool

724
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,679
no no one knows no one knows why it was

725
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,159
there who made it like why what it was

726
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,200
created like it just appeared and no one

727
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
said anything and then walked away from

728
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,240
it oh goodness apparently they say

729
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,320
mouse of madness says it was for drunk

730
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,760
hacker history

731
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
i would assume it would have been scab

732
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,440
hunt

733
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,480
gula what you got gosh

734
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,200
so

735
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,159
i don't steal that many things i mean i

736
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,159
captured the flag

737
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,600
one year and

738
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,720
i uh may or may not have captured a

739
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,840
hardware hacking village

740
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,279
oh gosh i'm just waiting for him to go

741
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,640
to the third wall and then to the

742
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,960
ceiling to the floor he just brought

743
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,159
death cam back home with

744
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,159
i can see into my closet and i have

745
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,799
another four of those and then i have a

746
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,679
couple of the actual defcon foam signs

747
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,600
and i think i have a floor decal

748
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,520
somewhere as well but i think that's in

749
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,120
storage still

750
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,639
oh i i can't say this

751
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,120
they don't have a name on them like this

752
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
is mine they're just sitting there i

753
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,279
don't know who they belong to

754
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,919
i can't i can't say this definitively i

755
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,440
am not a goon i am not speaking for

756
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,720
goons i'm not speaking for the

757
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,919
conference but i can't imagine that they

758
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,080
care about anything that's branded with

759
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,240
the defcon number on it right like if

760
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,360
it's branded con 29

761
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,720
do you like

762
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,559
are you just saying them a chore of

763
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,039
disposing of it is is i i'm just posing

764
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,039
a question there

765
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,600
i'm i'll i'll throw this in again

766
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,840
not speaking as goon or whatnot i am

767
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,480
guessing there is a a category of

768
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,679
off-limits there is a category of

769
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,360
free-for-all and then there's this

770
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,679
little middle category which gullo tends

771
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,399
to find himself in which is

772
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,080
probably fine maybe not but as long as

773
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,159
no one catches you or sees you or tells

774
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,720
you not to do it it's probably a gullo

775
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,760
thing

776
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,159
it's just the gulo category

777
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,360
i think the gulo category has also uh

778
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
rubbed off onto other people because

779
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,679
he's right on a lot of people

780
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,080
right there's a there's this is the

781
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,919
crowd that starts following to where

782
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,240
gulo starts doing something like hey

783
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
we could do that too and the next thing

784
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,399
you know all the signs are coming down

785
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,919
in the entire conference at the same

786
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,159
time in the closing ceremonies but i

787
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,000
mean so oh they're just doing really

788
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,159
efficient cleanup thanks guys

789
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,600
and then the next thing you know is we

790
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,960
get some really nice interesting

791
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,840
backgrounds in people's uh

792
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,159
webcams so uh apparently the viewers say

793
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,399
hoping to remove the sign

794
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,960
i'm just helping to remove the signs so

795
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,640
that they don't have to pay casino

796
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,120
people to go get forklifts and scissor

797
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,960
lifts to go up there to pull the signs

798
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
down

799
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,000
exactly

800
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,919
the viewers you can somehow get those

801
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,000
things down gallery the viewer the

802
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,480
viewers say that the oatmeal was a thing

803
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,960
for drunk hacker history uh some people

804
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,919
had to find a marble in the oatmeal and

805
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,919
your reward for finding the marble was

806
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,840
to get sprayed with a malort super

807
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,799
soaker

808
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,440
uh that sounds like defcon to me

809
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,360
that sounds like me

810
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,440
incredible

811
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,559
absolutely

812
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,200
wow i mean so let's

813
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,760
i was oh no i was just gonna add like i

814
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,440
think the other thing that the event

815
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,919
that happened was at one of the parties

816
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,000
uh dj jackalope

817
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,399
literally brought down the house

818
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,320
part of the chandelier started coming

819
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,360
down because of how hard she dropped the

820
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,519
base part of the drop ceiling started

821
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,039
falling off

822
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,559
and and on that and on that stage there

823
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,679
was this cardboard cut out of putin on

824
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,399
uh on a horse which eventually ended up

825
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,240
with googly eyes on it because of course

826
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,720
there's googly eyes all over defcon uh

827
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,399
yeah but apparent but apparently the

828
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,120
base also caused his head to fall

829
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,159
forward so dj jack lope also decaf

we go i can get it up here

861
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,799
i'm having trouble getting it up

862
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,000
actually

863
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,919
no your words not mine

864
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,279
you didn't have that problem last

865
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,440
weekend when you're hanging out with me

866
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,519
because he had that time with you last

867
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,480
weekend

868
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
see what what no one realizes like again

869
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,919
this is part of the story to come out is

870
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,720
when i when i was doing video it started

871
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,120
like i was i you know i hadn't i've done

872
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,600
video obviously i have my channel

873
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
but i had never done video in front of

874
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,919
other people and it is remarkably

875
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,559
awkward like having your camera up or

876
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,080
even having like

877
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,600
gallery with the full gimbal like

878
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,840
pointing at me and then having people

879
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,200
stand behind him watching you record

880
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,079
uh so we we uh figured out a nice

881
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,040
exercise to make it less awkward and it

882
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,119
most definitely involved taking glamour

883
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,199
shots of gauri which i most definitely

884
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,000
have

885
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,159
and will probably make their way into uh

886
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,399
videos over this next year so you guys

887
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,480
have that look forward too between

888
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,079
glamour shots of that and then uh

889
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,918
closing ceremonies i'm wondering if

890
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,440
that's why it's not online to where

891
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,960
anybody can watch closing ceremonies

892
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,560
anymore because there are a couple

893
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,960
pictures that were uh is that goo that

894
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,440
is uh that's gallery that's definitely

895
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,480
gallery

896
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,359
oh so they did not put the slideshow

897
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,800
they they put it on twitch but they're

898
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,879
not pulling it down to put it up because

899
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,800
those are like you can find the closing

900
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,918
ceremonies

901
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,199
any place

902
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,040
and i'm wondering if it's because uh

903
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,440
gallery there is uh striking a pose you

904
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,719
know what i'm saying

905
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,879
but so i'll throw a little more than

906
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,280
anyone ever wanted to see

907
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,680
[Laughter]

908
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
i'm i'm laughing because i'm i was

909
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
sitting in the hotel room with ast cell

910
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,040
uh info sister had sent out images uh

911
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,320
and we were going through all of our

912
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,800
images to put into the slideshow and i

913
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,599
walked into ast cell's uh hotel room and

914
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,960
i go i have the image i won i just won

915
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,920
def con there is no one can compete with

916
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,119
this image

917
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,520
i i've won and i show him the image he's

918
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,400
like you

919
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,040
you won and so if anyone can find that

920
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
image i probably shouldn't be

921
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,760
encouraging this i'm sorry

922
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,480

924
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,240
but i was i was so happy with this image

925
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,079
in the worst part of the worst part

926
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,119
about it

927
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,119
we organized all the images we threw

928
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,680
them all in the slideshow but none of us

929
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
really know like the slideshow goes up

930
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,119
at different times and sometimes it's

931
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,800
not they don't have time to go through

932
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,599
all of it this year i don't know why for

933
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,000
the first time in all of defcon history

934
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,280
they got it up really early so early

935
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
that it got to cycle

936
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,119
three times and it cycle not just in

937
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,520
person but for the first time ever it

938
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,720
got to cycle through twitch in youtube

939
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,400
and everywhere else they were live

940
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,280
streaming to show gowri in his uh

941
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,359
tuxedo his tuxedo um three times on

942
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,760
stream so i would be i would laugh my

943
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,599
butt off if like twitch pulled it down

944
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,400
just for that

945
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,960
it wasn't indeed

946
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,760
it wasn't

947
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,280
no he was completely covered

948
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,119
yeah we'll go with that

949
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,440
oh my goodness i'm just searching

950
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,560
through other photos here to see

951
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,320
uh we've posted a couple pictures of the

952
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,800
ceiling so not only did the the ceiling

953
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,359
come down for uh dj jackalope but

954
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,640

955
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
well so there's a picture of that with

956

all of our streams

958
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,160
i'm trying to see about some other ones

959
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,359
here as well

960
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,320
because there was one we were just

961
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,480
looking for somebody was talking about

962
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
there was still googly eyes all over the

963
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,760
place

964
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,920
so of course that i'm glad to see that

965
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,520
that was still around

966
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,640
um

967
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,760
let's see what else there was

968
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,800
to do

969
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,599
so while you're looking yeah go for it

970
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,800

how to make alex blush though randomly

973
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,680
walk up to him and tell him how much you

974
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,200

975
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,240
we were

976
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,359
absolutely astonished by how many people

977
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,480
had watched at least one or some of our

978
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
content including streams that

979
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,000
approached us at the con and everyone

980
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,520
was great everyone was absolutely

981
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,960
fantastic so if you guys came up and

983
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,400
lot more when i wasn't with you but um

984

if you want to be on the channel that's

991
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,520
uh that's the game right um but yeah

992
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,000
i'm fully expecting by the way like to

993
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,440
start getting photo but like i might be

994
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,560
doing a video and just people are going

995
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,320
to be jumping in the background but yeah

996
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,280
that

997
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,119
so we've talked about the the bad things

998
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,560
i think we keep transitioning to some of

999
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
the good things too but like

1000
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,720
specifically like my faith so what

1001
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
brings me back to the con every year is

1002
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
the people absolutely and it's funny

1003
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,960
because like everyone i asked that

1004
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,200
question to which was like what

1005
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,640
how long you've been coming to khan you

1006
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,760
know what's your handle how long you've

1007
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,520
been coming to khan what are you doing

1008
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,200
this year and what keeps you coming back

1009
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,720
every single person without fail was

1010
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,800
the people i come for the people i love

1011
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,000
the people

1012
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,720
i love the i feel like that what's the

1013
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,640
zoology or whatever it was i i love the

1014
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,359
people the people are the best uh but

1015
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,359
madagascar that's the one but it was

1016
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,640
they were

1017
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,119
it was the people and that was like one

1018
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,400
meeting people

1019
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,000
but more specifically when people were

1020
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,839
coming up like oh hey

1021
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,560
alex or silk i love your videos like

1022
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,800
that was so unexpected like i

1023
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,240
i think at the beginning of def con my

1024
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,119
channel was like 650 people

1025
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,800
and or 650 subs and having anyone like

1026
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,960
recognize you was

1027
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,720
beyond anything but then it just kept

1028
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,320
happening like

1029
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,960
we five people then 10 people then 15

1030
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,320
people it's like where are these how do

1031
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
you

1032
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,680
who finds this stuff like it's just um

1033
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,760
it was so that was like my favorite part

1034
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,720
of the conference anytime anyone came up

1035
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,680
that's awesome

1036
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,920
what was your favorite gator from on the

1037
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,680
virtual side

1038
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,520
uh so i love being able to interact with

1039
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,240
folks again in our discord chat uh

1040
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
moving folks over from the

1041
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,040
the discord channel over to ours because

1042
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,480
to be honest with you

1043
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,880
we've been using discord for a really

1044
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,520
long time so we've had a pretty good

1045
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,760
community built up way before def con

1046
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,839
jumped on that banned train so making

1047
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,760
sure to direct folks saying hey we do

1048
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
run a contest but you'll need to go to

1049
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,280
this site because you're not allowed to

1050
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,440
link to another uh discord that's a

1051
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,520
no-no that'll get you a nice little slap

1052
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,000
on the hand so it's a hey jump to our

1053
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,319
website which then you click the link to

1054
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,319
join our discord and then you get to

1055
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,480
talk with even more folks and things are

1056
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,920
fine um so jumping in and having the

1057
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,760
chat room open to where if there are

1058
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,960
questions i wanted to be asked some

1059
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,720
people were streaming different talks

1060
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,160
other folks were working on challenges

1061
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,880
left and right um when we go physically

1062
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,720
to the con typically you would have

1063
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
people gathering around a couple

1064
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,920
different tables and working together as

1065
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,720
like a holon or what we call as a team

1066
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,640
and

1067
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,680
the virtualness of that worked out

1068
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,920
pretty well in my opinion we had quite a

1069
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,520
few new players from defcon this year

1070
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,160
which was super super exciting um then

1071
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,079
we had we also had some interesting

1072
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,319
things where

1073
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,319
we were the only ctf that was open

1074
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,480
overnight and we were just using ctfd

1075
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,560
engine because we went from our own

1076
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,680
uh

1077
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,960
built game engine over to ctfd

1078
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,800
but that also meant that people thought

1079
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,400
it was just a ctf

1080
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,839
and that's why we made a couple of

1081
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,599
videos and training and saying hey so

1082
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,079
this is a learning platform here's how

1083
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,000
you go through and do and i had to reach

1084
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,680
out to a couple folks because all of a

1085
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,520
sudden you look at the score charts and

1086
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,480
it goes from everybody slowly arcing up

1087
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,560
and gaining points to new people and

1088
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,520
just go straight line going straight up

1089
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,160
and it's like yeah okay you gotta dump

1090
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,839
and number two

1091
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,240
how many people are on your team oh we

1092
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,480
have a team of five just boosting one

1093
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,319
account it's like that's cool bro i'm

1094
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,000
glad that you do other ctfs let me

1095
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,760
explain to you how this is different

1096
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,960
than other ctfs and it's like oh

1097
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,880
okay so are we getting kicked out so we

1098
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,640
can't play anymore no dude we're here

1099
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
for you to learn keep on playing you

1100
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,400
just won't be on the scoreboard to win

1101
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,560
as an individual learning things they're

1102
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
like that's cool let's go with it okay

1103
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,000
it's definitely

1104
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,839
it definitely seems like for contest

1105
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,839
runners and for you know booth runners

1106
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,599
and everything that it's it's definitely

1107
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,920
a lot more difficult to get people

1108
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,079
in and understanding your stuff when

1109
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,839
you're not standing in front of them one

1110
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:08,560
year

1111
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,480
one year at darknet i all i did was

1112
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,640
stand in front of the booth and just

1113
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,599
tell people all

1114
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,560
it's day like forced sentences and yep

1115
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,640
it you know you can and you can get it

1116
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,960
across in like two minutes but when

1117
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,240
you're virtual

1118
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,480
it's it's harder because you can't meter

1119
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,400
people out you can't you know look to

1120
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,000
see whether or not they're understanding

1121
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,520
and then adjust your messaging things

1122
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,560
like that it's tough it's

1123
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,680
go ahead

1124
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,839
but it absolutely was so i have gone

1125
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,280
horse over the years doing the same

1126
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,440
thing gallery to where i'm like since we

1127
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,839
can't be there in person here's a quick

1128
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,079
video so they land on the site here's a

1129
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,240
video of a two-minute here's what we are

1130
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,480
and what we do good luck and now jump

1131
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,640
into the contest because last year was

1132
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,359
like uh so everybody's virtual but with

1133
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,599
the weird part about the the conference

1134
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,440
being hybrid between physical and

1135
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,839
virtual but most of the contests were

1136
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,560
all virtual you had to have that info

1137
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,560
booth ready to go

1138
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,319
and if people hadn't joined your discord

1139
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,240
yet they couldn't see you live talking

1140
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,160
if they weren't on your twitch yet you

1141
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,680
had to have something to be able to jump

1142
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,800
off of

1143
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,319
i mean um

1144
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,640
well real quick and then we'll do some

1145
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,079
quick introductions because there's some

1146
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,000
new people here who don't necessarily

1147
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,119
know us but

1148
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,680
that's why dt said they are not doing

1149
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,240
this again um they are going back to in

1150
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,040
person you know covet allowing next year

1151
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,000
because

1152
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,599
he said it it's like planning two

1153
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,760
conferences and it's just not it's not

1154
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,560
feasible it burnt everyone out and i i

1155
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,480
would not be surprised by that

1156
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,839
well also

1157
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,800
usually hundreds hundreds of goons there

1158
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,720
was like 86 or something this year like

1159
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,119
there was very few goons which was kind

1160
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,800
of amazing too because there was a lot

1161
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,880
of opportunity for like

1162
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,440
bad shenanig shenanigans to get out of

1163

house

1214
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,640
[Laughter]

1219
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,720
uh gulo what do you got going on

1220
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,319
i am the great cornholio

1221
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,240
and i just do whatever i'm i'm the comic

1222
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,880
relief on here along with random

1223
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,200
really really random stuff so it's

1224
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,240
either highly intelligent or scar you

1225
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,920
for life

1226
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,400
and there's no in between i i'm i'm

1227
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
definitely on one end of the spectrum or

1228
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,440
the other all the time i i disagree with

1229
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,560
that

1230
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,880
because it can be end it can be highly

1231
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,440
intelligent

1232
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,960
i believe the most the most uh the most

1233
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,880
clear uh clear way that i have heard

1234
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,599
someone describe gulo is chaos monkey he

1235
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,640
is the chaos monkey

1236
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
that's the job title people want to give

1237
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,720
to me the other one is that i am

1238
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,720
adorafying

1239
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,640
that is the only word

1240
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,640
i love that

1241
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,839
i love that

1242
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,839
uh you're you're uh if you're watching

1243
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,280
this on twitch or you're watching on

1244
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,079
youtube it's uh it's my channel uh but

1245
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,560
the story behind that is when i started

1246
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,200
the channel i think in november i was

1247
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,880
like oh i'm going to be another crypto

1248
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,640
cat or i'm going to be another like

1249
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,400
technical person and then i realized

1250
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,240
that's a horrible idea because i did

1251
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,079
that for work for like 15 years and i

1252
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,960
have absolutely no want to like teach

1253
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,839
pen testing so it started out with a

1254
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:28,240
video of how uh gullo and gallery uh

1255
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,440
made a

1256
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,280
forgery of the defcon 27 badge a highly

1257
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,599
technical forgery using a urinal cake

1258
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,079
and a paper cup and random parts they

1259
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,000
found around the conference and i did

1260
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,079
this video and then we did a live stream

1261
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,920
talking about the full story of how they

1262
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,680
met the universe uh which was uh uh

1263
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,839
interesting person who yelled out i am

1264
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,599
the universe

1265
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,359
and from the depths

1266
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,920
yeah from the bushes uh did that story

1267
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,319
and then it kind of like throughout now

1268
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,480
a couple months now trying to find my my

1269
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,599
niche and groove on youtube but

1270
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,160
the streaming just kept up we i we use

1271
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,839
it as a shameless excuse to hang out

1272
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,599
with each other and i then do videos

1273
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,599
during the week right now we're at a

1274
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,240
weird part of my channel where i was

1275
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,839
from that urinal cake video and other

1276
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,559
ones i've done def con asked me to be a

1277
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,880
goon uh and then i ended up doing as

1278
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,839
many videos as i can gauri was there

1279
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,920
holding the camera but getting in front

1280
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,640
a few times and for his glamour shots as

1281
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,880
well um and then i'm just shoving out

1282
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,280
those videos uh my background is uh i

1283
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,119
was a security tester in pen tester

1284
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,000
forever and then left started my own

1285
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,720
company with an awesome partner

1286
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,640
and uh have been doing that for a few

1287
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,319
years i

1288
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,880
went to defcon since defcon 16

1289
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,559
uh competed in darknet won a black badge

1290
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,920
at both defcon and also one at girkon uh

1291
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,000
and then realized i quickly wanted this

1292
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,760
was a team i needed

1293
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,319
cool people i wanted to uh hang out with

1294
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,520
so i

1295
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,359
joined the darknet team and then this

1296
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,280
past year was my first year gooning at

1297
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,200
def con so i think that's more

1298
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,640
information than you care to know but

1299
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,960
that's uh that's that's me

1300
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,200
and you missing the background where you

1301
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,880
can also go through and check out uh

1302
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,559
silk's other videos in the past because

1303
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,800
he's done interviews deep diving on some

1304
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,200
of our different backgrounds as well so

1305
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,400
lots to be able to go through and do

1306
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,079
here we've been

1307
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,119
friends and or going to defcon all

1308
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,440
together this was the 10th year of the

1309
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,480
dark net so we've been around each other

1310
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,720
for at least that long and then when you

1311
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,119
go to defcon you're kind of like hey i

1312

1314
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,280
we even go drinking together or we do

1315
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,440
some type of contest together so

1316
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,280
uh let's go hang out again

1317
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,040

1321
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,119
no we haven't gotten to the rest of us

1322
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,000

1323
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,319

1324
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,319
you guys did the two hour

1325
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,800
you guys did the two hour deep dive of

1326
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,839
the

1327
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,720
uh urinal cake badge the universe is

1328
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,319
like this is

1329
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,440
live

1330
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,720
oh yeah this is not pre-recorded folks

1331
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,040
hold on hold on you think we actually

1332
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,520
prepare for this thing ahead of time

1333
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,680
more than likely everyone joins two

1334
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,280
minutes before a stream and you're like

1335
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,040
okay we're doing this thing this is fine

1336
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,960
it's fine that's good i usually don't

1337
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,280
know what we're talking about until

1338
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,359
i joined this stream 10 minutes before

1339
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,920
it starts because i don't want to print

1340
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,079
anything that's that's work do you want

1341
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,839
to go off the cuff

1342
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,520
um so actually

1343
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,200
this is actually one of the best parts

1344
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,280
about defcon and one of the things that

1345
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,960
we talked about this a really long time

1346
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,720
ago like what does defcon mean to you

1347
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,040
and what surprises you and and i think

1348
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,040
that this carries over to this year as

1349
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,960
well which was i have a really nice

1350
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,000
snippet on on uh twitter somewhere that

1351
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,559
alex really likes which is that

1352
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:05,920
defcon

1353
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,760
somehow managed to take the hacker

1354
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,040
manifesto and manifest that in person

1355
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,119
right we don't have a face we don't have

1356
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,880
a name we don't have a nationality we

1357
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,720
don't have skin color we don't have a

1358
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,559
gender unless you want to reveal all of

1359
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,359
that

1360
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,040
and at defcon

1361
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,599
somehow they've managed to cultivate

1362
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,319
that community where you can show up and

1363
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,960
people accept you for whatever it is you

1364
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,000

community um and that's the that's the

1379
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,760
magic of defcon the other magic of

1380
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,240
defcon is that you learn people's

1381
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,119
handles and you never learn their names

1382
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,720
which is amazing because we're sitting

1383

on stream we're all totally friendly

1384

guys to find when i go live and stream

1401
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,440
because

1402
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,520
no one technical has been on there it's

1403
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,839
still just the standard people that work

1404
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,599
on those websites

1405
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,680
oh he teaches soldering

1406
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,079
oh yeah i teach basic electronics and

1407
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,000
soldering on

1408
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,160
um like my free cams and chatterbait and

1409
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,319
those so but you don't have to worry

1410
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,839
about ever being taken offline like you

1411
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,040
do with youtube and talking about a

1412
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,559
hacking channel that's the nice thing

1413
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,440
about those right so i'm i'm completely

1414
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,599
down with what you're saying there gulo

1415
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,160
uh yeah odyssey library something else

1416
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,359
but

1417
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,640
gallery hit it in the head though it's

1418
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,480
like yeah it's funny we half of us don't

1419
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,480
know each other's real names actually i

1420
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,160
don't think anyone knew mine until now i

1421
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,200
like hit my channel right on it so it's

1422
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,119
right there for everyone to see

1423
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,119
that was awkward i feel like there's a

1424
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,400
story of how like weird that was going i

1425
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,920
i know this has been my handle i always

1426
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,280
knew at one point i was gonna attach to

1427
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,960
my name i was never like worried about

1428
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,839
that but it was totally weird going okay

1429
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,440
my real name is gonna be out there which

1430
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,359
also means my address is out there

1431
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,200
should i be worried about like doxing or

1432
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,440
something like that and gowrie said it

1433
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,520
best he goes yes you know what

1434
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,800
you have to be willing that if someone

1435
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,960
finds your address he goes i'm like yeah

1436
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,240
i go i guess i'm not really worried

1437
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,079
about that yes just make sure they call

1438
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,839
first so you can hang your ass out the

1439
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,240
window when they drive by i'm like you

1440
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,520
know what

1441
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,000
gauri has been my person to keep me sane

1442
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,720
through a lot of like the weird

1443
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,359
weird things uh and also like he was the

1444
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,040
one who encouraged me at def con he's

1445
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,880
like no no don't just shove out content

1446
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,800
get the content out there stop like

1447
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,720
figuring out music and tweaks for it

1448
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,400
just like get the content out there and

1449
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,119
without him i would have not gotten like

1450
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,760
the 20 videos i think we're gonna end up

1451
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,359
having for def con this year like it's

1452
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,319
it's just

1453
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,680
it's ridiculous

1454
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,280
next year we're gonna have i think next

1455
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,040
year we're gonna have a ton more and and

1456
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,799
and the whole goal this year for anyone

1457
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,480
who wasn't watching the stream before we

1458
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,319
went we talked about this whole goal

1459
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,839
this year was

1460
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,520
it's going to be mostly virtual most

1461
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,200
people who attend they said most people

1462
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,359
who attended was like 34 000 people

1463
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,440
virtual and in person which means the

1464
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,839
con was about as big quote-unquote as it

1465
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,640
was before but everyone online was gonna

1466
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,240
not get a chance to see what was going

1467
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,359
on on the floor and on top of that even

1468
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,240
if you are in person and it is that big

1469
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,559
it's really difficult to see and talk to

1470
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,559
everyone because you know the conference

1471
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,480
organizers or the the

1472
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,640
event organizers can only talk to so

1473
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,559
many people throughout the weekend

1474
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,240
otherwise there would be massive lines

1475
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,000
for everything right

1476
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,240
so i think it's really nice to be able

1477
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,799
to take an uncut interview where we just

1478
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,640
say hey you have 90 seconds or two

1479
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,079
minutes to give your spiel the thing

1480
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,599
that we've been doing at darknet for

1481
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:28,559
years

1482
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,640
um and and you know put it on video so

1483
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,280
that people can get that introduction in

1484
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,640
a really nice condensed way and say and

1485
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,400
in future conferences that's what i'm

1486
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,599
going to do like that's what i'm

1487
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,960
interested in that's what i'm interested

1488
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,160
in because the hardest thing to do at

1489
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,000
def con is actually fun we like to say

1490
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,079
find your people or find what you're

1491
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,359
going to do because it's such a

1492
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,400
whirlwind

1493
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,079
and so i think the goal this year was to

1494
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,319
figure out can we actually walk up to

1495
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,000
these booths and say

1496
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,680
tell us what you're doing because

1497
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,240
oftentimes and this is this is actually

1498
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,559
pretty unheard of right because

1499
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,640
defcon does

1500
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,040
is not nice to having video cameras

1501
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,680
around right you have press badges you

1502
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,520
have the media that show up no one

1503
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,440
trusts cnn or fox or msnbc because every

1504
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,960
time they cover the conference it's

1505
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,680
always illegal hackers are hacking your

1506
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,000
everything right and that's not what

1507
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,960
i mean

1508
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,319
i'm not gonna say those people don't

1509
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,720
show up to defcon but the majority of

1510
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,480
people who show up to defcon are there

1511
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,960
to build community and there to share

1512
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,400
what they're doing and figure out what

1513
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,400
other people are doing it's it's

1514
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,559
it's it's an exciting group to be a part

1515
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,920
of and

1516
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,119
it was nice to see uh i mean the the the

1517
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,799
hardware hacking village the interview

1518
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,559
we did with crawlik when we asked him

1519
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,880
originally everyone there was like no no

1520
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,880
no no no because they got the perception

1521
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,319
of oh it's going to be an interview like

1522
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,720
with media and then it clicked for them

1523
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,880
they're like wait a minute it's silk and

1524
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,440
gallery i know these people i i trust

1525
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,599
them and it was amazing to see time

1526
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,200
after time the number of times you're

1527
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
like oh if you're not press and you're

1528
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,319
just doing this for defcon yeah we're in

1529
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,000
whereas they a lot of them didn't want

1530
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,599
to have interviews with press because

1531
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,240
they knew and gator knows this better

1532
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,040
than any of us the press does a really

1533
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,520
bad job they editorialize the hell out

1534
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,559
of everything and they you know

1535
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,240
you just plug in the usb and you dump

1536
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,839
out all the codes

1537
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,280
baby dump out all codes and they

1538
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,040
misquote you and stuff

1539
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,559
i'll give context to that one because i

1540
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,400
think there's a little bit more context

1541
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,480
which is like gator was interviewed by

1542
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,720
the press and essentially he was talking

1543
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,559
about our dark net badge it was really

1544
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,119
cool it worked as an hid here i'll kick

1545
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,839
it on over it works as an hid and you

1546
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,400
would plug it in it would dump out codes

1547
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,839
and it would type them into a notepad

1548
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,680
like you'd plug it in and it would type

1549
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,280
them all out and then you would input

1550
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,280
those into the game and get points

1551
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,079
and somehow the news like was like oh

1552
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,000
yeah and you plug in any of these badges

1553
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,839
into your computer and it dumps out all

1554
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,319
the codes and they clipped it so it

1555
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,160
looked like it was like this auto hack

1556
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,400
device to steal all your information and

1557
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,480
it was oh it was so gross

1558
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,200
so the the title of that is still called

1559
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,559
super hackers def con xyz no it's like

1560
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,680
way

1561
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,559
legitimately and i'm like oh god they'd

1562
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,520
never grab my handle or anything else

1563
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,760
with that because that was so pulled out

1564
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,280
of context it's stupid so but instead of

1565
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,599
people being fearful of what's going on

1566
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,680
at def con on okay turn off your

1567
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,200
bluetooth turn off your wi-fi turn off

1568
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,040
your cell phone don't take anything with

1569
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,880
you uh instead

1570
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,920
we're dressing up like dinosaurs and

1571
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,520
fighting each other

1572
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,079
in the conference right and i put i'm

1573
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:42,480
dropping links to this this is what the

1574
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,319
def con community is man um you have two

1575
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,200
people dressing up in dinosaur suits and

1576
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,160
it's grifter and jason street and

1577
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,480
they're fighting each other

1578
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,079
like and that's

1579
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,720
going gula

1580
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,440
is so for the years i i think i've been

1581
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,960
going to defcon the longest out of this

1582
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,960
group i've been going since seven and

1583
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,480
throughout the years there have been no

1584
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,079
photo policies at def con you would get

1585
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,440
shunned bands yelled at if there were if

1586
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,280
there were photos taken but

1587
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,200
next year's going to be weird because

1588
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,040
gallery and silk are still talking about

1589
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,200
recording things and

1590
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
it's going to be a weird game of tag

1591
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,359
where i try to run from them because if

1592
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,760
they're recording i can't

1593
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,839
generally release things with statute of

1594
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,599
limitations in place because they're

1595
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,000
just doing it live

1596
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,760
well yeah and

1597
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,599
i'll go in here here uh yeah i'll jump

1598
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,280
in here which is there's a couple things

1599
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,799
going on here it's like when we've been

1600
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,079
i mean i've been pushing up videos and

1601
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:46,240
we've been recording like this is not

1602
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,200
like like kind of like

1603
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,520
like just like slowly

1604
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,640
gauri is sitting there with a full ball

1605
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,720
blown gimbal like it is there is no way

1606
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,400
you are like you're hidden from it now

1607
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,640
we learned a ton while doing it like

1608
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,480
certain things like threw off auto focus

1609
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,400
on this camera like masks i wasn't

1610
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,400
expecting that audio while it was really

1611
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,240
good at sometimes like having a separate

1612
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,599
mic like learned a lot of technical

1613
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,359
stuff around that like iso and stuff

1614
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,799
which i was like okay i'm learning with

1615
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,839
this but like it was very obvious we

1616
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,960
were recording full-blown gimbal so like

1617
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,720
and everyone everyone always had the

1618
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,720
option no one actually did this but if

1619
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,319
anyone would have came up and said like

1620
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,000
hey i don't want to have my face on

1621
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,319
there okay cool bam delete move on to

1622
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:31,440
the next one

1623
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,319
um

1624
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,319
i i kind of like there's some prep work

1625
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,680
that went with the photo goons like

1626
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,200
cannibal who kind of like prepped me for

1627
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,760
like here's but like what was so cool is

1628
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,839
we had some of these connections

1629
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,319
crawling by far was the coolest one who

1630
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,440
like didn't want to be in front of the

1631
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,760
camera and then all of a sudden he's

1632
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,280
like oh yeah it's it's silicon gallery

1633
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,359
of course i'll be there and i'm like

1634
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,960
if you want me to delete it if we do it

1635
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,480
you don't like it we'll delete it we'll

1636
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,200
edit it like but it was that one was the

1637
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,280
thing which was so unexpected for me at

1638
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,319
def con

1639
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,880
was everyone's willingness to jump in

1640
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,960
front and and tell their story and share

1641
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,400
their passions

1642
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,240
that's actually where i kind of want to

1643
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,400
do over because the first couple videos

1644
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,119
i did was all about like the hat con

1645
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,760
stuff like with these cool like hardware

1646
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,280
hacking like

1647
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,839
rigs they put together and hearing them

1648
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,559
just passionately talk about it like

1649
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,400
that one was by far the coolest part of

1650
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,960
my def con but yeah it's these it didn't

1651
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,400
happen in a bubble like we were like

1652
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,839
sneaking going up there you know and you

1653
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,160
think it's going to be my face on cam

1654
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,118
that you should be worried about

1655
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,480
but we've already seen other body parts

1656
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,760
cool

1657
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,599
oh gosh you should

1658
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,040
go next year if

1659
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,960
if if you have another another stupid

1660
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,960
secret challenge which requires me to

1661
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,240
read braille off your backside again

1662
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,400
i'm i might have to record it actually i

1663
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,920
was going to say i'm not doing it but

1664
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,440
i'll totally record it and put it online

1665
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,880
for everyone

1666
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,160
the only thing i was going to say was

1667
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,400
the other thing and defcon definitely

1668
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,160
impressed us upon us when they knew we

1669
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,839
were taking video and doing all of that

1670
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,079
there there are rules right and it the

1671
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,559
rules are if anyone says please delete

1672
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,400
that you delete it right there and

1673
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,799
that's the end of it and two is you know

1674
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,559
you don't try to be sneaky you don't try

1675
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,160
to take photos at anyone anything like

1676
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,200
that so

1677
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,680
not only was i trying to be blatantly

1678
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,480
obvious as to when the camera was on i

1679
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,640
was also trying to keep the camera

1680
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,039
focused on the individuals we were

1681
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,680
talking to and avoid capturing as much

1682
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,079
of the background as possible to you

1683
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,599
know for for the sake of the conference

1684
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,160
goers because not everyone wants that um

1685
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,240
i do want to rewind a little bit and say

1686
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,160
like while you know defcon is

1687
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,200
transformed into this um

1688
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,119
into this you know publicly acceptable

1689
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,000
place for for hackers to be themselves

1690
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,079
i would still not go

1691
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,319
and connect your personal laptop to the

1692
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:59,520
open wi-fi the secure wi-fi no problem

1693
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,119
still wouldn't connect it to the open

1694
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,680
wi-fi uh there's definitely quite a bit

1695
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,160
of nastiness going on on that and that's

1696
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,839
still the most dangerous network in the

1697
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:08,720
world

1698
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,240
that was something which always would

1699
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,240
just crack me up is they do a like a

1700
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,319
full disclosure and a

1701
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,079
uh i think they call it a transparency

1702
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,240
report both for like uh

1703
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,480
any events that happen at def con but

1704
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,720
the network they said it was like

1705
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,680
on-site uh like 15 of attendees

1706
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,280
connected to the secure wi-fi in 85

1707
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,480
percent connected to the open wi-fi like

1708
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,119
for whatever reason like that's

1709
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,760
like that's a terrible idea like it's

1710
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,520
all like it's not there's no host

1711
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,359
isolation everyone can see each other's

1712
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,640
devices like

1713
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,280
i

1714
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,039
mean maybe it's kind of just like you

1715
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,799
know you're in vegas so let's let's

1716
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,160
connect and see what happens

1717
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,599
oh yeah i definitely did at one point

1718
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,000
open my phone and click

1719
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,200
defcon

1720
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,839
open and then she's like oh crap turn it

1721
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,920
off turn it off don't do that don't do

1722
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,760
that

1723
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,359
so hilarious

1724
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,160
it is vegas it's like going to some of

1725
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,280
those

1726
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,480
questionable dark alleys and catching an

1727
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,119
std it's you'll just catch an std from

1728
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,280
the one clock

1729
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,920
oh my gosh

1730
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,720
in with that that's probably where

1731
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,880
oh and that and that's probably a good

1732
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,160
place to just close it on up uh there's

1733
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,079
so much more to talk about with def con

1734
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,799
there really is like both

1735
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,119
the good the bad the ugly i'm sure we'll

1736
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,280
talk more about it next week as well we

1737
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,400
stream every week uh around 11 o'clock

1738
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,799
saturday next week unfortunately i think

1739
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,319
it's going to be changing but i will do

1740
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,920
an announcement on on twitter and i'll

1741
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,920
make sure to schedule it nice and early

1742
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,640
with that though and stds on the wi-fi

1743
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,559

1748
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,240
want to keep the gadgets dry

1749
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,319
um so i'm looking forward to talking

1750
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:05,359
about the different badges that were

1751
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,559
also this year as well because there

1752
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,559
were some really cool makers this year

1753
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:09,920
who were able to not only do it in

1754
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,640
person but also online so look forward

1755
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,680
to talking about that i really enjoyed

1756
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,599
virtually seeing and interacting with

1757
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,839
everybody virtually at defcon

1758
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,599
love our players of the

1759
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,400
darknet contest i hope that you guys are

1760
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,160
still out there learning we actually

1761
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,160
moved things to where it

1762
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,920
it we had some interesting challenges

1763
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,839
with it but everybody worked with it

1764
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,640
really well we were able to pivot and be

1765
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,119
able to take off from there and we've

1766
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,280
now got some of those

1767
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,520

that we didn't get a chance to talk to

1791
