i absolutely love this question because

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,640
one of the first videos i ever did on

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,200
youtube

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,759
was about gulo and gowrie's low-tech

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,880
hacking skills

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
on how they made a near-perfect

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,360
duplicate of the defcon 27 badge

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,079
not using advanced cnc machines or

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,600
circuit board fabrication

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,920
but a urinal cake they found in las

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,640
vegas

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,680
they used that the bottom of a cardboard

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,560
paper cup

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,920
in parts they found around the

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
conference what's so cool about it is on

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
their way to get their forgery judged

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,479
they were able to fake pair with joe

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,000
grant the designer

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,239
and the dark tangent who runs the

20
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,920
conference what's more is the unique

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,520
coloring made attendees think

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,120
pairing with it would unlock hidden

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,200
functionality they paired with

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600
hundreds of badges and thousands of

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,239
noses

26
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,320
subscribe and hack on
