4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,880
competition at def con earth in my

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,920
opinion it is an absolutely incredible

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,960
competition and i love it because anyone

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,439
can compete it doesn't have to be

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,719
someone who's highly technical it can be

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,960
anyone even if it's your first time at

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
defcon this year it's both virtual and

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,000
remote and they give an incredible

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,239
amount of work in it and it's not just

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,079
like incredible amount we're creating

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,120
the list but the set around me like look

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,480
at this

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,079
you have an old original monitor

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,480
cutting in for a minute this is a

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,039
terminal not a monitor i'll blame the

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,520
coffee for that one back to it this is

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,960
ridiculous

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,879
you look around they have like the

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,119
original old printers

23
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,920
but just i love this competition because

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,200
it's so approachable the people who run

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
it are fantastic and what ends up

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,240
happening is hackers come around the

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,439
contest

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,920
and they pick up a list read through it

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
and that in and of itself is so much

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,880
entertainment but then they go around

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,400
and create new ways of answering the

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,439
list like just looking at it fish and

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,520
chips that's p-h-i-s-t

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,720
hack the planet with an axe

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
a moby duck

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,960
a buffalo overflow

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,759
a polp pulp fiction

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,280
in sweet potato baby there is just a

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,479
ridiculous list it goes on and on and

40
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,200
seeing people come around

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,399
in and just submit their entries has

42
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,640
been a huge entertainment

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,200
one more reason i love this contest is

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
the people the people who come to this

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,959
booth are absolutely some of the most

46
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,680
friendly and most passionate individuals

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
who love

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,879
this culture love our hacker culture and

49
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,599
it just exemplifies what we're looking

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,480
for

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,000
at def con ridiculousness and embrace

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
your weird which is accepted

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,599
let's take a look at one other thing

54
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,800
right here which is probably the most

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,599
important thing on the table

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,720
