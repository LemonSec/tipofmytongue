armed with a urinal cake does anyone

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,240

sophisticated piece of tech

called a badge developed by some of the

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,000
best hardware hackers and puzzle makers

paying full price

now badge fortune has a long history at

28
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,680
the conference

oscilloscopes and more

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,000
to duplicate the badge in recent years

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,920
the forgeries have costed more than the

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,799
badge itself

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,479
and it's unknown if anyone's actually

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,080
been banned for a forgery

41
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,640
albeit a sense of pride the adrenaline

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,560
rush of walking past security

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
or the excitement to fool nearly 30 000

rush to reverse engineer fabricate

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,920
in full defcon so how did these two do

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,400
it

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,690

gauri and gulo landed in vegas and i

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,159
just collected my badge

52
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,479
and they were frantic to see it now i'm

53
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,680
not a hardware hacker

badge

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000

technology

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,760
the badge could communicate with other

induction transceivers

forging the components alone

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
would be difficult but not impossible

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
until gulo flipped

80
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
over the badge and saw the one element

81
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,200
they didn't plan

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
for the badge had a specially

handcrafted quartz backing

84
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,319
a fourth inch thick puck and it couldn't

85
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,000
be duplicated without expensive

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,720
stone carving or polishing tools

88
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,959
and he found his answer a urinal cake

89
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
gulo and gauri set off on their own

90
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,400
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed at 9pm into

91
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,360
the vegas strip

92
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,400
to find a urinal cake but three hours

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,040
went by

94
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,640
and they were still empty-handed i

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
remember gowrie yelling

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,720
do you have any idea how hard it is to

97
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
find a urinal cake in

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
vegas they were met with failure at drug

99
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,360
stores

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,920
cleaning supply stores governor even

101
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,840
broadcasted out to the darknet community

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,959
which is like a rich

103
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,720
hacking community in the largest hacking

104
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,239
contest at defcon

105
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,879
and even they failed ghoul finally just

106
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,920
exploded

107
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,040
annoyed fine if we can't buy a new one

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,799
we'll settle for a less than new one

109
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
they put on their nitrile soldering

110
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,080
gloves and sent back

111
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,000
out into the night we were banned from

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
several strip clubs

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,959
bars dive bars casinos cvs's walgreens

114
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,400
and albertsons

115
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
because no one appeared to like nitrile

116
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,720
gloves and saran wrap

117
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
yeah this is completely normal and not

118
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,799
weird at all in vegas

119
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,840
at 2 47 exhaustion and desperation

120
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
started to set in as the night went on

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,720
and they started dredging the depths of

122
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,000
vegas urinals

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
looking for that precious jewel

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
restaurants strip clubs

125
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
we just need to use the bathroom we're

126
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
looking for a urinal cake

127
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,479
they said stone cold sober i can't even

128
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,759
imagine what was going through the

129
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,040
bouncer's mind

130
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
really pissing off a few strip club

131
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
bouncers at 3am

132
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,000
almost six hours later they found their

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,120
prize

134
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,759
where from though they refused to share

135
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,040
to this day

136
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
it was fished out of a strip club though

137
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
as they got it out of the blacklighted

138
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,000
vegas

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,040
strip and into the normal lighting joy

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,960
turned to ash

141
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,199
because when they saw the color it was

142
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,400
pink

143
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
bright pink the wrong color not even

144
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,320
close to the marbled quartz of the badge

145
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,040
and the shape was off it was lopsided it

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
was too thick

147
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
i mean used journal cakes aren't really

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
known to be exactly uniform

149
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
yet with the materials in hand they were

150
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,450
determined to solve the problem

151
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,600
[Music]

152
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
at def con 27 i was helping run darknet

153
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,039
in working with an

154
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,560
awesome group of hackers to help

155
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
distribute our dart net badges

156
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,039
it was the second day in we were

157
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,160
exhausted

158
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,960
and tired though something odd started

159
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
happening we're a tight-knit group

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,680
we started getting headaches and weirdly

161
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,800
pissed off

162
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
it was at that time samosa and i

163
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
connected eyes

164
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,440
and it started dawning on us what was

165
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
wrong

166
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,759
what is that smell and what the hell is

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,320
that smell

168
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,199
for the uninitiated who have never been

169
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
to a men's truck stop bathroom

170
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,280
these things have a very distinct and

171
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,479
pungent smell

172
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
now this is a bath bomb of my daughters

173
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
and this smells

174
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,560
pretty strong but urinal cakes are meant

175
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,759
to cover up some

176
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,479
pretty bad smells so they're

177
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
mind-numbing

178
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,960
worsened though gowri started shaving it

179
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,440
down

180
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,720
and shaping it with a dremel and he had

181
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,919
to fix the color

182
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,280
he combined white soap shavings in heat

183
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,759
created with friction by polishing the

184
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,280
top of the urinal cake

185
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,080
on the carpet behind the booth it

186
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,479
smelled like a hobo made out with mr

187
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:24,960
clean

188
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,160
in a desert vegas porta potty for like

189
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,600
24 hours

190
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
it was bad also fun story they're

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,720
poisonous

192
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
we found this out later in a gizmodo

193
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,919
story posted online

194
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,840
after the conference it would explain

195
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,880
why some of us started getting

196
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
nosebleeds but when the deed was done

197
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
those two geniuses had polished their

198
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,240
precious payload to a handcrafted court

199
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,280
shine

200
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
now they had their critical piece and

201
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,319
their payload creation

202
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,479
could begin but they were running out of

203
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,280
time it was at this point it was 4pm on

204
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,919
saturday

205
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,000
where the restrictions of stopping nod

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
badge wearers would be lifted in about

207
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,880
two hours

208
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,280
after the methodical polishing process

209
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
the cake looked remarkable

210
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,440
near perfection gary scavenged parts

211
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,800
from the darknet badge

212
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,479
though he was still missing critical

213
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,160
components like the distinct

214
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,280
microcontroller

215
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,560
the nfmi transmitters after a quick

216
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
visit to the hardware hacking village

217
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,800
and

218
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,599
favors exchange with leap bunny gowries

219
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,160
scored

220
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,800
genuine defcon badge replacement parts

221
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,160
back at the darknet table

222
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,919
gary glued them to the bottom of a

223
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,160
coffee cup to simulate the circuit board

224
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
of a real badge

225
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,400
the result was stunning so incredible

226
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,160
that i still remember him falling

227
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,800
over with uncontrollable laughter like a

228
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
mad genius

229
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,039
after his creation came to life the cost

230
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,800
of forge a 300

231
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,720
human badge was less than five dollars

232
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
and pissing off the people that love

233
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,360
them the smell really was mind numbing

234
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,759
to truly test the forgery they wanted to

235
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,199
go big

236
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
not just bypassing hundreds of security

237
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,639
staff but fooling

238
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,759
joe graham the designer himself and

239
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,360
the dark tangent the founder of defcon

240
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,720
the deed was done a simple walk through

241
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,319
the conference floor was like

242
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,720
parting the red sea there's something

243
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,879
they did not expect held them back

244
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,120
it wasn't a security staff goon but

245
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,080
instead

246
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,120
tens and then hundreds of defcon hackers

247
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,000
stopped to

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
pair with them it was the unique

249
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,919
coloring of the urinal cake badge

250
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,559
gave it a nuance and uniqueness which

251
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,240
attendees had assumed

252
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,440
was an elusive hidden badge they paired

253
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,120
with hundreds of badges in thousands of

254
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,919
noses

255
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,440
eventually though their first target

256
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,320
came into sight joe grant surprisingly

257
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
had already heard the rumors

258
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,200
though nothing had prepared him for the

259
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,480
overwhelming sensation

260
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
that he would feel being close to such

261
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
majesty with 10 minutes to spare they

262
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,360
found their target the dark tangent

263
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
you want to pair badges with us yeah

264
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
he held up his badge they held up theirs

265
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
nothing they moved a little closer

266
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,080
my badge must not be working and then

267
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,920
the smell hit him

268
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
and he knew as they were called up on

269
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
stage they walked past

270
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
both a group that had paid over twelve

271
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,560
hundred dollars in custom fabrication

272
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,120
in another that actually went to a stone

273
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
mason

274
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,920
in amongst laughter in cheering gulo

275
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,600

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,760
with their counterfeit urinal cake badge

287
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
we can smell it from here two hackers

288
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,320
that put their heads together and built

289
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,440
a visually

290
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,519
near perfect duplicate using their minds
