1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,760
in vegas

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,918
in the biggest and largest hacker

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,040
conference in the world also hosts the

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,240
most paranoid security people in the

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,120
world

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,840
so

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,400
it's natural to defend yourself against

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,960
all the snooping all the wireless and

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,720
all the government microchips which we

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
all know are injected into our hands all

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,119
the time in our sleep

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,960
for the most part so the best way to

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
protect yourself is with a tinfoil half

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,119
an defcon

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,480
we have some of the best tinfoil hats

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,840
that you can absolutely create and as a

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
challenge at defcon the best one wins so

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,640
this is tinfoil hat we are

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
currently making

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,879
defcon attendees construct tinfoil huts

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,559
to protect themselves from evil mind

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,000
control rings

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,110
so we have a

24
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,559
[Music]

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,239
couple receivers set up and a

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,559
transmitter somewhere in this room

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,800
we do a delta between uh the two

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,120
receivers to see how much we affect the

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,080
signal

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
wait hold on hold on i'm getting in

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,560
front of the camera right now

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,799
did you just say that it's not just like

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,280
a conspiracy theory where like you're

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,520
brilliant for a hat you actually measure

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
the efficiency of the tin foil yeah you

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,479
can actually see it going on behind us

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,520
so okay that is freaking incredible it's

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,840
not just building one for the best looks

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
but which one actually has the best

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,799
signal interruption in it right that's

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
freaking science here yeah

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,360
serious operation absolutely

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,759
amazing quick question would this stop

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,399
the voices inside my head

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,560
it could stop the working amplifier

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
depending how good you are and uh

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,799
creating a tinfoil hat some of the

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,000
people

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,439
made really good antennas today

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,399
oh incredible thank you crux uh and we

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,399
will talk to you later this is the

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,200
tinfoil hat contest

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,399
at def gun you come you build a tin foil

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,040
hat you wear it around conference and

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
you get the enjoyment of knowing you're

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
protected against every government chip

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280
in your hand and any wireless signal

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,040
which is going through your body all

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,680
within your own protection

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
hack on
