1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
the largest hacking conference happens

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,040
in about

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,319
two months defcon 29

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,120
and we just exited defcon 28 which was

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,639
safe mode which was remote

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,280
defcon 29 it's hybrid and i'm gonna

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,000
share with you

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
the top three reasons i love def con and

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,920
i go

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,880
two reasons which tend to give me pause

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
and one which can kinda go either way

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,279
like me with my coffee i go dark roast

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,000
and

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,320
light roast sometimes covered in whipped

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,238
cream and sprinkles number one though

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,520
is the content the content at defcon

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,480
is incredible it's not just the talks

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,360
because you do get

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,200
talks not only just have a technical

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
nature and all the exploits that

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
happened during the previous year

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,039
but also ones like jason scott sharing

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,039
about text-based adventure games and

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,559
archive the web you can also find tons

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,320
of villages like the lock-picking

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
village or the social engineering

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,480
village

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
so even if you're not a technical

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,879
developer but you're just a general geek

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,800
you can come and learn how to do

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
lock picking number two absolutely needs

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,640
to be

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
the contests and i don't know why all of

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,560
these start with the letter c

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,040
but the contests are incredible at def

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,880
con and it doesn't matter whether you're

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,799
technical or non-technical

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
there's contests for you whether it's

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,960
hack fortress or

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,040
darknet which i'm obviously biased for

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,560
since i helped run it

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
or hacker jeopardy or the scavenger hunt

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,799
which is just

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,520
finding funny items and bringing to that

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,040
table and those people

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,560
are amazing who run that contest

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
every one of the contests i feel has

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,720
just an incredible group behind it

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,159
to just help you win just

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
have fun and enjoy the contests at def

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,600
con you will find one that you enjoy

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,399
number three is the biggest one for me

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,119
it is the

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,320
biggest sea of the lot and that's

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
the community the community at defcon is

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,640
absolutely

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
fantastic and it's a huge conference it

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
is 30

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,840
000 people this year is def con 29 we're

60
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,000
just coming out of defcon 28 which was

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,080
safe mode which was all virtual

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,160
this year is going to be hybrid but the

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,680
community at defcon

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
has to be one of the best ones i've met

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,239
because everyone

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,800
loves being there they love teaching and

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,239
they love

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,800
learning so you find other individuals

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
who are passionate now

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,440
here's the thing with that big of a

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,280
group yes you're going to find people

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
you don't get along with

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,800
but that's what's so much fun with the

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
conference is because

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,920
of the villages because of the contests

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,120
you can find your tribe at defcon

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,040
which you get to go hang out with and

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
some of the best ways to meet people

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,319
are simply the defcon forums twitter is

80
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,760
really active during the time

81
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
but with this year it being hybrid

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
discord is where all the action's

83
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,920
going to happen spinning to the two

84
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,080
things i don't like about defcon

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
or at least they give me pause each year

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,000
when i'm going to reserve my ticket in

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,959
the hotel

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,200
and it's another c but it's a small one

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,959
which is the cost

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,239
the cost is relatively inexpensive

91
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:12,879
compared to

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,879
other conferences but there is still a

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,159
lot of cost

94
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,200
you're paying for your flight you're

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,360
paying for your hotel you're often

96
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,080
paying for

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
your conference ticket i'm a little

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
lucky here because not only do i have a

99
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,560
black badge

100
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,799
but i also am a contest runner so that

101
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,599
also gives you

102
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,159
entry for free but the cost does add up

103
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,959
you're paying about

104
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,920
300 either your ticket you're paying

105
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,799
upwards of

106
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,879
six seven eight hundred dollars for your

107
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,640
hotel though if you book

108
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
early and use the defcon block there is

109
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,920
a pretty

110
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,720
hefty discount for it which is great on

111
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,920
number three you're paying for your

112
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,480
flight

113
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,280
and this ties into my second kind of

114
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,599
just

115
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,799
hate it just i really really struggle

116
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,760
with this one

117
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,319
and it's the clock i don't i don't know

118
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,760
what to go see where it is it's the time

119
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,400
zone change

120
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,159
i'm from the east coast and flying to

121
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,480
the west coast it's a three-hour time

122
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,159
difference in a four-hour flight

123
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,640
so that's a seven-hour swing so when my

124
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
flight takes off at noon

125
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
i land at 1pm vegas time

126
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,480
now that's not bad i like traveling over

127
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,760
there it feels like you just gained a

128
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
bunch of time

129
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,560
but coming back it stinks

130
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
it just stinks because you're flying out

131
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,680
either as a red-eye at midnight

132
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,720
in high land at seven a.m

133
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
eight a.m and it just wrecks my next

134
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
week but the honest truth is

135
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
it's worth it defcon is absolutely worth

136
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,520
it now the last one which can go

137
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
either way like my coffee habit is

138
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,600
it's remote this year and it's on site

139
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,120
this year it's a hybrid

140
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
defcon 29 is this weird mix of

141
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,280
on-site not on site and i understand

142
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
this is going to be a learning process

143
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
and because of kovid it kind of has to

144
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,639
happen

145
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,880
but the reason why this is both a pro in

146
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,680
a con

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,479
is kind of interesting i'm guessing def

148
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,320
con is only going to have

149
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
five to six thousand people on site as

150
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,440
opposed to

151
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,720
the 30 000 people which means

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
on the pro side it's gonna be intimate

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
you're gonna meet people

154
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,759
really closely you're going to be able

155
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,039
to hang out with

156
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,120
some of the die-hard fans

157
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,479
of defcon which is gonna be so cool

158
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,680
where you're gonna might feel the fomo

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
of or the fear of missing out if you're

160
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
on site because you're missing out on

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,560
some of the online memes

162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,199
and jokes and interactions at that side

163
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,160
of the community

164
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
or if you're online you're gonna feel

165
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,639
like you're missing out on some of the

166
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,800
the gatherings and groups and maybe even

167
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,320
some of the villages

168
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,199
and if you're on site it's going to be

169
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,919
