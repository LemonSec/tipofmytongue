1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
i am sitting down with the designers of

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,520
the tour badge which i touched on my

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,240
other video but this one specifically is

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,719
absolutely bonkers because unlike just a

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,799
blinky led badge

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,640
it is a lie detector in a badge and we

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,240
want to go into some of the details i'm

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,480
hooked up to it right now

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,720
and we'll get to try it out but first

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,800
let's just talk about the badge in

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,480
general i have the creator sitting here

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,680
we're going to keep them off camera

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,080
though so can you give me like a one or

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,840
two sentence description of like what

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
does this thing do

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,000
sure so this is a mini lie detector or

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,719
polygraph so it has two primary sensors

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,879
it has a heart rate sensor that shines a

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,399
green led into your finger and then

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,120
measures the blood flow and it also has

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,320
a galvanic skin response sensor or gsr

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,399
which measures measures the resistance

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
difference between those two finger

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
cuffs on your finger

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,399
so as you get nervous or an adrenaline

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,160
dump or embarrassed you sweat a little

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
bit and the resistance between those two

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,879
contacts on your fingers will change

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,559
it's vegas so i'm pretty much sweating

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,799
all the time i'm a big dude

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,720
so i'm hooked up to this thing right now

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,640
so you have a lot of sensors we also

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,240
have the person who designed all the

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,119
hardware for this badge now question for

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:15,920
you

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
is

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,840
when you were designing this badge like

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,880
it has been a nuts year for badge design

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,640
did you get hit with any of the chip

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,960
shortage problems oh yeah yeah we had a

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
lot of trouble with the chips uh

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,119
specifically the potentiometer you know

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,040
it's such a standard simple part but we

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
had a lot of trouble getting these uh we

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,960
actually had to buy really long ones cut

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,040
them down because we couldn't even get

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,200
the right part and we had to do a few

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,880
more substitutions for the chips we had

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,720
to use like automotive grade parts where

50
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,159
normally you wouldn't need automotive

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,000
grade parts they're a little bit more

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
but they were available and that's what

53
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,960
we had to use

54
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
um as far as i know we bought almost all

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280
of these microcontrollers that that they

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
had because as soon as we as soon as our

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
order was filled they were sold out

58
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
so yeah it was it was it was nuts with

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
the chip shortages so what gave you the

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,759
idea for this like again between there's

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,960
two other things i want to talk about

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,199
but like what gave you the idea to do

63
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,360
like this is a crazy design i've never

64
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,920
seen a lie detector in a badge and it

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
totally feels a little weird being

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,879
hooked up to it right now

67
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,760
so i made a badge in defcon 23

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
originally for the defcon shoot it was a

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,520
shot counter and clapper and some other

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
things then two years ago i made these

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
little shitty add-on

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,360
badges for tor and that was also a

73
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
fundraiser

74
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,480
and i've always kind of wanted to do

75
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,879
another badge seed studio has this suite

76
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,760
of sensors called grove sensors and one

77
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,519
of them is a gsr one of them is a heart

78
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,519
rate so i could kind of breadboard this

79
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
out really easily see that it works

80
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,000
test the oleds make sure the

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the refresh rate on the oleds is fast

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,879
enough

83
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,959
and uh yeah i mean it's just a kind of

84
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,000
fun little

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,319
badge that actually does something and

86
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,239
it's kind of fun to play with now you

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,080
something you said is like this this is

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
like there's

89
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,599
obviously there's a little bit of profit

90
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,519
when you sell these where does that

91
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,519
profit go do you keep that just to make

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,200
create your new badge or is that going

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,440
to support something yeah so all profits

94
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
from this batch sale and the batch sale

95
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
two years ago go to the tour project i

96
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
fund all development personally and if

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,519
the badges come back and they don't work

98
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,519
i am just screwed and i lose all my

99
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,800
money

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,599
no one funds me initially i just hope

101
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,280
that i sell that they work and i sell

102
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,000
enough to recoup my hardware costs i

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
don't charge for my time or effort or

104
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
anything else i mean what's really cool

105
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
about that too is the fact that like

106
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
they sold out like of course they're

107
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,480
gonna sell out it's a lie detector

108
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
in a badge like

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,760
what's not to love about that it's not

110
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,599
like those crappy lie detectors like

111
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,159
you'd get like in your 101 electronics

112
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,760
kit which never worked like this thing

113
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,879
is actually kind of solid like it's

114
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,400
still a small one and you got like

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
sitting on it and there might be some

116
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,159
defensive measures so now let's try it

117
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
right now so i'm hooked up to the thing

118
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,799
right now can you go ahead and we'll get

119
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
this thing started

120
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,439
so on the right screen is the heart rate

121
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,280
sensor now right now you're just picking

122
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
up like ambient light changes

123
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,840
the left screen is the galvanic skin

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,160
response sensor so it's going to measure

125
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
the difference in the finger cuffs that

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
you have on your finger and as you move

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
around or change the pressure on there

128
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,320
that's why it's kind of jumping around

129
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,400
so if if you remain still and take a

130
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600
sharp inhale exhale breath and kind of

131
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
force yourself to sweat a little bit or

132
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,400
get nervous

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,160
in and out quickly

134
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,759
yeah it's dropping it's dropping

135
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,840
so it picks up that like inner

136
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,360
embarrassed feeling or that flush

137
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,960
feeling and that causes a little bit of

138
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,600
sweat and that sweat causes a difference

139
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
in resistance between those contacts so

140
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
okay so one of the ways i've always seen

141
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
lie detectors use is that you calibrate

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000
it with like a few questions so like ask

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
me like a couple easy questions like

144
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
is my shirt red or something like that

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
well that's the thing they don't use the

146
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
easy questions they use the hard

147
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
questions that's why they get you they

148
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,600
ask you something like have you ever

149
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
stolen anything and then you confess to

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
maybe stealing a few little things and

151
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,759
then they say other than what you've

152
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,160
told me have you ever stolen anything

153
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
and then that that's called a probable

154
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
lie question okay so you you

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
almost certainly are lying because you

156
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
can't possibly remember everything that

157
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
you've ever stolen

158
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,240
so so have you ever stolen anything

159
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
absolutely not never before oh you look

160
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,600
like oh

161
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,479
it's dropping it's already dropping

162
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,599
that's a massive lie

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
okay okay you know what i'm gonna

164
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,479
comment on this i may have used napster

165
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,880
at one time in the past to steal like

166
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
once that's not even stealing

167
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,240
that's what it was no

168
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
all right so that that's so cool it did

169
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,880
massively drop when you said that that

170
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,880
that's that's absolutely insane so with

171
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,800
them sold out

172
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
there might be another production run

173
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
there might not be another production

174
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
run where should they be looking to see

175
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,919
if they can pick one up yeah so i'm

176
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,479
personally bad at uh optimizing

177
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,240
fundraisers i mean if i was good at this

178
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
i would just make a massive run and sell

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,680
a bunch online it's more like a hobby

180
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,479
fundraiser so that's why we make these

181
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,160
at defcon and then

182
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,919
usually try to sell out which we have

183
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,759
both two years ago and this year i'm

184
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,600
gonna contact tor and see if they're

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
interested in making another run if we

186
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,560
are

187
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,000
you can follow the tour project on

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,919
twitter and i'm sure they'll post about

189
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,280
it if that happens

190
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,840
