1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,080
we were just walking through the contest

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,520
area and we have

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,799
the craziest setup right now it is

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,360
hackasat and i'm guessing that means

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,000
hack a

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
satellite yes that's correct hack a

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,080
satellite i did have somebody come by

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,040
yesterday and say

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,320
what is this hacked saturday

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,920
i mean you have satellites set up i

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
didn't even know like this was a thing

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
i'm looking at the screens behind us

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,400
like

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,640
this is insane like this is can we all

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,840
acknowledge

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,640
hacking a satellite is beyond web

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,640
application little network like this is

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,559
into some pretty crazy stuff

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,280
so what can you just briefly describe

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,079
and it's a ctf it's a competition right

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,840
it's more than just a competition this

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,600
you know we do have a ctf

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,160
for those hackers that are very advanced

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,079
but we also brought here to defcon

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,360
this weekend the hands-on education

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,039
and bringing some of the novice

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,559
researchers interested

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,239
up to speed so they can maybe someday

29
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,000
participate in the ctf

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
and compete oh so it's it's not just a

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,000
it's not a like you have to be an expert

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,360
to compete it's

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
anyone can do it yeah so that's uh

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,680
that's exactly right so

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,840
what we wanted to do is bring the whole

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
awareness of what it takes to

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
cyber resiliency cyber resilient if

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,119
that's a verb

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,360
a satellite from the get-go right so

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,479
designing it

41
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,640
through launching it to operating it so

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
what you're looking at here

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,240
this is a good example a visual of like

44
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
a virtual machine so before the

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,680
satellite even gets into the hardware

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,040
components

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,280
these software tools will allow you to

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,079
figure out

49
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,920
okay how should we orient the stuff

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,280
inside the satellite what kind of

51
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
mission is the satellite going to do

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
what kind of architecture should we go

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
for so you can do a lot of

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,920
troubleshooting here

55
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,479
which is obviously a huge cost saver but

56
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,360
then

57
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
from here go on to the okay we're gonna

58
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,720
actually start putting these things

59
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,759
together right

60
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,079
so when you hear buzzwords about like

61
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,920
digital engineering and things like that

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,520
that's that's an example of what this

63
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,399
is so bringing that awareness of hey

64
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,840
satellite development they just don't

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,200
magically get up there

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
so like how do we start from the get-go

67
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,640
what does it look like to present

68
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
and develop one and then also how can we

69
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,758
bake in resiliency

70
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,680
from the virtual machine all the way

71
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,480
through to launching the satellite

72
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
what's so crazy to me is like everything

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,760
you just said like there are like other

74
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,920
there's other ctf competitions and

75
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,040
there's like you know

76
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,200
cap capture packet and some of them like

77
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
take on this like almost like

78
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,640
or like hack fortress is a good example

79
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,080
i love hack fortress

80
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,879
but it takes on this like gamification

81
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,760
where it's like

82
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,599
a caesar cipher or something like that

83
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,200
which doesn't really you don't

84
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,080
come across those in the real world so

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,040
with this

86
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
you're you're like this is simulating a

87
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
real world satellite it's not like a

88
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
gamified version

89
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,120
yeah and i also did want to hit on it

90
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,800
too as far as the ctf

91
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
uh for our final event coming up in

92
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
december it's a little more than that

93
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,400
right so

94
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,879
each each team in our final event eight

95
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,400
of them they're going to have their own

96
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,840
you know copy of this right so they're

97
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519
going to be able to practice and

98
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,200
for this year it's going to be an attack

99
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,640
defend so they're going to

100
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,480
win points by taking out other

101
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,319
competitors satellites taking that down

102
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,480
while also having to defend their own so

103
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,000
it's a little more than this

104
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
structured ctf you know that's very

105
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,040
traditional

106
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,959
we're taking it kind of you know given

107
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,879
them a path and they can do how they

108
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,560
want with it

109
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,519
it's totally like an attack defense game

110
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,400
as well

111
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,040
now on a technical level how does that

112
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
kind of work like

113
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
everyone's remote i'm guessing there's a

114
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,840
lot of complications like that

115
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,000
does it communicate more like like more

116
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
like virtual systems or

117
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,040
have you like simulated like if this was

118
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,319
out there like these are

119
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,280
actually how they would communicate so

120
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
yeah it's going to be virtual remote not

121
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,959
to get any competential sensitive

122
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,720
information or whatever but yeah

123
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
so it's gonna feel very much like i was

124
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
talking about when you're doing these

125
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,879
sort of things with these virtual

126
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,400
machines it feels very real

127
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
so the operators they're gonna the

128
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
operators aka the participants

129
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,920
they're gonna be at their home station

130
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
you know with their teams

131
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,720
and they're gonna be remoted in because

132
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,319
when you think about space operations

133
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,439
with a real satellite

134
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,879
that's remote anyway because the

135
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,319
satellite's in space and you're on the

136
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,000
ground so to them it's going to feel

137
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,599
very similar to what actual space

138
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,680
operations feels like

139
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
all right so question with spit you say

140
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,720
it's going to feel like really like

141
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,159
space operations

142
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,760
and again don't you don't have to repeal

143
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,279
anything confidential

144
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,000
but how bad is the latency like have you

145
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,478
had that

146
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,320
baked into some of the communication

147
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
where you push a change and

148
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,440
how long does it normally take for a

149
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,280
change circuit

150
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
yeah so when you talk about commanding

151
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,479
space vehicles and talking to space

152
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,680
vehicles that's something that we're

153
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
definitely baking in

154
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,280
with the the shout out to cromulance

155
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
who's building our challenges like world

156
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,840
class right

157
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,759
so when you're talking to a satellite

158
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,280
for example a satellite in like low

159
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,240
earth orbit

160
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
you may get you know a couple contacts a

161
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,080
day and those contacts could be just

162
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,720
like you know

163
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,840
10 to 30 minutes so or even shorter so

164
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,199
when you talk about latency when you're

165
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,880
in view of the satellite the latency

166
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,639
isn't terrible but you also have a very

167
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,520
narrow pipe

168
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
so you can't push too much information

169
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,199
but then you got to wait for that sucker

170
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,639
to orbit the earth before you can come

171
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,800
back and talk to it again

172
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,639
i think what you meant is not pipe but

173
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,639
it's it's the tubes right the tubes

174
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,800
might slow down no i'm just kidding

175
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
so one question i have is like a lot of

176
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,560
so much of this

177
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
type of thing i've never hacked a

178
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
satellite i can imagine most people at

179
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
home has never had to sally

180
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,720
what type of like vulnerabilities are we

181
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,919
talking about is it like

182
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,639
trying to crash the satellite into the

183
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,960
atmosphere and light it on fire

184
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
or is it delays or communication or can

185
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
we not talk about any of this

186
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,639
well we're looking at a number of

187
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,560
different services that the satellite

188
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
provides and the different components

189
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,000
that are within the satellite so uh

190
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,080
the vulnerabilities can vary i could i

191
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
could talk a little bit about last year

192
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
some of the competition challenges that

193
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,479
we had

194
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,759
like comms and um

195
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
you know payload different different

196
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,600
components of the satellite that we

197
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,759
would be examining for vulnerabilities

198
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
so like what was the if you can talk

199
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
about last year what was the

200
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
most like the most incredible

201
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,319
vulnerability that was found last year

202
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,639
maybe even when that was unexpected i

203
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,560
don't know if i have a good answer

204
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,919
i can i can hit on that a little bit

205
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,600
nothing specific on the vulnerability

206
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,160
but

207
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,840
kind of to showcase what is actually

208
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
possible last year uh the winning team

209
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,360
actually took control

210
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
of the satellite we had a we had a flat

211
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,479
sat on an orbital

212
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,319
and uh for the wind to win the

213
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,080
competition uh they were able to

214
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,600
actually manipulate the satellite

215
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
to take a simulated um a picture of a

216
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
simulated moon so they were actually

217
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
able to get in and start controlling and

218
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
adjusting the satellite for how they

219
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,160
wanted to

220
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,199
so you can imagine yeah and then

221
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,120
they also were able to submit commands

222
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,800
to a real satellite and take the picture

223
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,680
of the real moon

224
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
so if you go back and search hackasat

225
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,199
and look at our stuff last year

226
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
the winning team they have a tweet with

227
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,039
their team name and the picture of the

228
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:49,440
moon

229
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
that the commands they submitted ran on

230
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,520
the real satellite

231
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,560
you're not they're no joke i'm i'm

232
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
looking at gallery and he's

233
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,280
nodding that's that's insane

234
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,919
like i'm assuming they patched this

235
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,520
thing right

236
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,039
so i don't want to get into too much of

237
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,479
how they did it just for the sake but

238
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,919
what like the whole point right driving

239
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,280
back as to why we're here

240
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,319
so you have the barrier to enter from an

241
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,000
economic perspective of space is

242
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,919
lowering constantly by all these people

243
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,680
that are putting up stuff right so

244
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
if you've got all these private citizens

245
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,759
these schools these small companies able

246
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
to put up satellites

247
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
how do we know that they are also being

248
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,479
as

249
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
forthcoming and cyber resilient minded

250
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,080
as we are right because space is a

251
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,039
global thing

252
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,599
we all share it so if you've got one guy

253
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,919
who's haphazardly throwing up stuff

254
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
it's a threat to everybody so we're

255
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,520
really here to just like make sure that

256
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,080
hey like

257
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,759
you need to think about cyber security

258
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,080
and oh also like best cyber security

259
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,680
folks in the world here at defcon so

260
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
like let's get them thinking about it

261
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
and like how can we together make sure

262
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
that space is protected right because we

263
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
need space every day

264
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,759
whether you're a fan of like the

265
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,759
government or whatever or not you still

266
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,520
need to go to an atm you still need to

267
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
use your bank card you still need to you

268
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,879
know use your cell phone all of that is

269
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
reliant on our space systems and if we

270
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,000
lose those we're screwed

271
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
that is incredible hey i know there's

272
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,000
incredible amount to talk

273
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,240
about here but thank you so much for

274
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
your time this is an incredible

275
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,280
competition it's not

276
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,520
often like you see competitions where

277
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,160
like you can get an eip overflow in your

278
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,479
basement and it it's kind of exciting

279
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,960
but seeing like the satellite move

280
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,240
taking pictures like

281
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,639
having the virtualized environment is

282
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,919
absolutely

283
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,599
incredible thank you so much for sharing

284
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,679
thanks for watching and hack on

285
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
all right one quick thing that we forgot

286
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,600
to mention is how do you get involved

287
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,120
whether it's twitter whether it's a

288
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,720
website and whether or not you want to

289
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
look at previous competitions so

290
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
where can they find you on twitter yeah

291
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,080
so

292
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
tweet uh just search uh hackasat and

293
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,200
it'll be at hackasat and then go to

294
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,360
hackasat.com

295
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,640
that's probably the easiest way to get

296
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,240
connected we have all the links there to

297
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
include our github link

298
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,519
that has all of the previous challenge

299
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,360
to include the challenges and the

300
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
solutions for them right so if you are a

301
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,360
team or you want to start a team

302
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,080
go there learn and then be prepared to

303
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,560
come play
