1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,920
we were walking through the contest area

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,360
and we came across

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,440

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,679
with paper airplanes

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,360
all the way to the wall some with some

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,440
pretty impressive distances

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,920
and people are just pouring in to give

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,720

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,760
some crazy

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
funky outrageous activity for people to

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,200
do

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,800
and we're like let's have paper

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,719
airplanes so

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,280
we got a paper here to do it we got

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,719
crayons to color

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,360
we got uh little flinging rockets and

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,120
little flingy chickens

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
and uh set up some targets in the back

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,840
we got a nice little runway up there

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
and people have just been going crazy i

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,160
thought it was gonna be just a goof

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,559
and uh we ran out of paper yesterday i

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,600
had to buy

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,240
two more packs today and as soon as i

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,360
put the paper out

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
people just like wolves on a carcass

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,119
came in

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,400
i mean it's absolutely hilarious because

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,880
like

39
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,280
you see the floor is just littered with

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,000
them all right

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,680
so you've now been doing this for almost

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
two days what has been

43
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,720
the most impressive one that you've seen

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,759
one guy made like a spear

45
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,360
and uh like almost a javelin type thing

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
and was flinging it all the way down to

47
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,560
the end and

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
actually got into one of the holes so it

49
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,360
was almost dangerous

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,479
as to how big and heavy it was we were

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,119
asked by defcon to set up a netting here

52
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,000
just so that things didn't escape too

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,720
much

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,280
we didn't want to you know attack the

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,119
packet hacking village or the

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,439
well we did want to attack them i mean

57
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,479
that is incredible

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,840
especially the javelin you have to

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,240
always be careful man thank you so much

60
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
