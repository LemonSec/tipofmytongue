1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
it is good to be back uh man it's it's

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,759
so cool uh def con is over which is

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,000
unfortunate and bittersweet but the

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,719
channel has grown to over a thousand

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,719
subscribers thank you thank you for that

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,679
that is

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,000
not what i was expecting in such a short

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,320
period of time i wanted to share though

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
my thoughts on def con what went well

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,119
what uh how many mistakes i made it's uh

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,039
significant i also

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,039
found a secret uh how to get over

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,800
anxiety that gowrie showed me uh it's

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,280
it's embarrassing mostly for him and i'm

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
going to i cue you on in on that a

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
little bit later uh first though uh my

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,160
defgon experience started in chaos when

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,719
last night my flight was canceled i'd

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,640
even know that was gonna be a thing or

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,520
how that's a thing but zero hour spirit

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
decided to cancel like half the flights

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
in the country and i was scrambling i

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
found another flight i did book first

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,359
class on delta so

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
that's a thing which i'm kind of excited

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,680
about but my wallet hurts just a little

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,280
bit i'm dealing with a hotel

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,240
confirmation issue but man i am going to

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,479
defcon and i can justify all of these

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,960
expenses because of you

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,759
i got to goon uh which is why a ton of

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,240
videos have been going up uh they've

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,280
been uh interesting we'll say uh both to

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,200
edit to shoot uh tons of mistakes i

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
think the biggest thing i learned was

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,640
audio uh having a dedicated mic made the

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
videos sound so much better so if you

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,560
have been watching them i definitely

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,200
plan to use a dedicated mic for next

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,799
year but

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,400
i'll keep pushing them out uh whether or

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,119
not the audio's great on them uh is yet

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,680
to be seen also if you have been

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,000
watching them you'll notice a wonderful

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
mistake i made

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,439
consistently i sounded like a broken

47
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,759
version of the lego movie where

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,880
everything

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,159
is awesome

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
i kept saying oh that's so awesome

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,040
that's so cool i think uh part of it was

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,159
anxiety

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,719
part of it was it was incredibly hard to

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
hear through a double mask on some

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,399
people while the mic picked it up really

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
well i was having issues hearing um and

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
i wish i would have just taken some time

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,640
to pause

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,000
and

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,959
just

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,879
talk to them hear what they were saying

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,720
processing it maybe even doing a second

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,920
take

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,720
though

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
all this really started though

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,760
um after i got to the hotel room

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,879
so let's start the beginning of the

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,680
story i got to the hotel room after the

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
chaos of like a hotel room that wasn't

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
canceled the airplane but i got to the

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
hotel room i was so excited to start

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,239
shooting i did uh two uh selfies one was

73
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,440
about preparing coffee and then acting

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,319
like a hobo trying to bum hot water off

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,200
another goon which worked successfully

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
but i went to take the second selfie

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
and it went well and i made a mistake

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,159
and i was like okay cool i'll re-shoot

79
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,239
it and i started reshooting the selfie

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,319
and halfway through it i realized

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,959
something um i went over to the bed i

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,560
sat down

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,519
and the weight of defcon hit me

84
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,480
i was looking out at the vegas strip

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,959
and i realized that

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
holy crap i can't do more than one take

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
uh i i actually i remember the first

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,879
thought that went through my head was

89
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,440
this is going to suck because i can't do

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
double takes

91
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
i can't uh

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,040
do like there's no do-over with it

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
and i i started getting a lot of anxiety

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,799
for it in some of the videos i shot i i

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,720
released them a little out of order so

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
those were the ones where i tended just

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,200
to ramble say that was awesome

98
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,239
in

99
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,720
i focused more um

100
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,280
on the contest in events

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
and less on people which was one of my

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
biggest goals i had at the conference

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,080
wasn't introducing you to the ctf and

104
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
the contest so i i did all of that

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
i wanted to introduce you to the people

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,439
and that's one of the things i feel i

107
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,920
learned from this year which i'm really

108
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
excited for next year because what def

109
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,478
con is is the the people it's not the

110
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,959
contest so those are there

111
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,959
but the people in the community i mean i

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,639
did some of those interviews with

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,880
individuals what is your handle how long

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,720
you've been coming to khan and what

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,040
keeps you coming back and time and time

116
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,440
and time again it was the people what

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
keeps you coming back it's the people i

118
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,919
mean the the hacker family so that's

119
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,759
that's the other mistake i made i

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,479
focused a lot more on the event

121
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,880
and not the people but i mentioned the

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,720
anxiety i was feeling overwhelmed not

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,120
sure how i was going to get so many

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
videos done

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,759
and this is where gowrie came in

126
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,680
uh he's live streamed there's tons of

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
live streams where he's just again

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
awesome he's just awesome like i i

129
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
started a newsletter i actually

130
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,880
mentioned him in it because he without

131
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
him there's no way i would have gotten

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,479
as many videos done not only was he the

133
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,560
one behind the camera most of the time

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,800
holding it but he was the one pushing me

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320
to say hey let's go interview them let's

136
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
go talk to them let's move over to this

137
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,520
contest and he pushed me through it

138
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
but i promised you one thing i promised

139
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,479
you

140
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,479
i was going to tell you how i overcame

141
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
some of the anxiety

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,919
shooting

143
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,639
oh oh it's good uh

144
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,039
what ended up happening was i wasn't

145
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,560
sure how to be in front of the camera

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,680
but i also had never shot and moved my

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
camera in front of other people where i

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,039
was the one shooting among a crowd where

149
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,400
i always had that feeling oh my goodness

150
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
someone's gonna be looking at me taking

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,479
video of them and tell me to stop which

152
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,080
actually never happened there's two

153
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,759
reasons for this one because i had a

154
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
giant gimbal

155
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,680
so it was huge everyone could see that

156
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
they were being recorded no one actually

157
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
said no most of the people came up

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,520
introduced themselves and wanted to be

159
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,199
in front of the camera which was

160
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,240
just awesome it was really cool uh we

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,800
actually meandering one more time we had

162
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,199
people come up to us during the

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
conference like i'm

164
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
i mean it's not a big channel a thousand

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,520
subs i mean is huge for me but like in

166
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,759
the grand scheme of things the fact that

167
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,880
