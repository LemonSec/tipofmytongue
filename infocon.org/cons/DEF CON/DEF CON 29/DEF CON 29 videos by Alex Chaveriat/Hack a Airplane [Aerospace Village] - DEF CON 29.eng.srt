1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:13,040
[Music]

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,960
we're at the aerospace village and this

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,880
is the bricks and

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,199
bricks in the air bricks in the air yeah

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,119
so what can you explain what it is

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,279
absolutely so we've got lego placeholder

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,760
aircraft that are our bricks in the air

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,920
for the aerospace feel the nice thing

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,439
with the lego kits is you get like the

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,119
movement you've got articulation with

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
engines and landing gear um and so we

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,680
can build this interactive thing that's

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,000
in a safe academic way to like make

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
airplanes like demystified so that

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
people can feel comfortable interacting

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,039
with it and so we've got we're exposing

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,280
the low-level protocol which is similar

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,879
to what you'd find in a real airplane

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
we're using i2c

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,879
locally here it's cheap it's ubiquitous

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,199
it's easy for like people to understand

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,879
but in real commercial planes are

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,079
different protocols the 1553s the 429s

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
there's a lot of similarities so there's

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,359
bus controller and there's receiver

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,720
transmitters

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,240
and everything can talk on the same bus

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
and it's a flat network in that sense

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,439
all of that is present here again in an

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,920
academic kind of learning exposure type

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,040
environment

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,119
so like one thing we can do on this kit

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,119
like let's lower the landing gear or did

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,200
you have something no but why don't we

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,119
just do speeds on the propeller let's do

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,680
the setup yep so it's running pretty

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
slow right now right and

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,360
i wanted to bump that up a little bit

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,439
there we go so we have our lower level

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,960
uh

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
commands here okay we're moving up a

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,479
little bit

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,079
and in the challenge um you move through

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,920
various stages we'll let you do a little

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,360
bit more each time

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
and uh should we show them

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,439
yes all right and the goal the goal of

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,000
this is to is it to reverse engineer the

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,520
protocol to figure out the protocol and

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
learn how to control it reverse engine

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
reverse engineering the protocol yeah

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,719
you could totally do that it would take

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,920
you a lot longer than you want to sit

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,560
down here and work on right so

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
the way we kind of phrased it is you

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,878
have the maintenance manual right here

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,639
and that kind of gives you a leg up so

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,239
you can go through here and figure out

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,280
okay well we have all these different

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
devices here here are the addresses here

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
the protocols

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
uh different commands that we can do and

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
then you kind of got to figure out how

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
it works and you play with them and you

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
move on and as you go through

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
uh

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,040
once you

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
break those limits you're in a debug

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,920
mode where like all right we can send

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,080
whatever we want now we're no longer uh

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,239
protected by the regular flight mode you

72
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,400
could do things like set the engine

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
speed to 11. and if you do that

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,239
oh sheesh

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,120
you found like an edge case in our

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,280
academic scenario where the engines were

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
over sped it was like an uncaught error

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,760
handling kind of thing and so like we've

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,519
seen this now in like the real life if

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,360
you will this is like the fun prize for

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,920
people to win but really the challenge

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,159
is to like sit down and have fun

83
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,080
learning through i mean we're sharing

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
all the information and so it's kind of

85
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,239
learning like this concept of addressing

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,319
and commands and responses and like

87
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,640
deliberately setting that to get a

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,879
prescribed reaction and what's so cool

89
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,480
about this it's not often like

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,239
oftentimes like when you get a

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,080
successful hack it's like you're you

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
might be in your basement you overflowed

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,080
eip and it's like

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,200
it's like you're the only one who's

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,440
celebrating with this it's so cool that

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,799
you guys have built something which

97
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,040
simulates sped up the engine too much

98
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,959
and smoke comes out is there any other

99
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,799
elements which happen with this

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,440
yeah so we can uh open and uh close the

101
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,200
landing gear here too and i'm we'll do

102
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,319
this

103
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,599
this way just because i don't have the

104
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,599
commands up at the moment this is our

105
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,400
admin controller yep so we can uh spin

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
us back up over there but we can also

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,319
drop our landing gear down so all these

108
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,560
things are accessible through uh the

109
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,599
actual

110
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
uh command you probably remember exactly

111
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,080
what you need to do for all that yeah so

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,599
like that's so cool so they're pretty

113
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,319
much

114
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,599
going through the manual figure out

115
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599
where where in memory they make the

116
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,080
changes to make this happen on the plane

117
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
and then try and find the edge cases

118
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,040
where they maybe can push the speed a

119
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
little too fast or instead of saying

120
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,280
okay the landing gear can go up or down

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
but what happens if i send it to this

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,399
third condition yep exactly but man with

123
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,880
that this has to be one of the cooler

124
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
setups i have the last thing i want to

125
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,919
ask is what hardware are you using right

126
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,320
now i see a bus pirate i see what looks

127
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,840
like a raspberry pi what's all

128
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,960
controlling

129
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,840
the lego kit starts and stops right here

130
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,160
at the infrared control so this is all

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
lego power functions after here this is

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
exactly where the device is connected

133
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
so then we've got this

134
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,320
purple board made from osh park and it's

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,720
designed i designed that as well

136
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
so we got three i mean it's a little

137
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,280
heavy-handed uh or ate mega 328

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,520
controller so it's the arduino stack

139
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,360
flight control computer

140
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,720
engine control computer and then the

141
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,120
landing gear control computer

142
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
um and so

143
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,320
this is a stack where we're exposing

144
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,039
like we're prescribing i2c addresses for

145
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,400
the computers

146
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
all on the same bus and then what

147
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
they'll do is when they receive a proper

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,479
command send out an ir signal to the

149
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,639
appropriate channel to then control the

150
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
lego power position so

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
our interface to physical asset safe

152
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
academic

153
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,039
and then here is our like representation

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,039
of avionics okay that's like you know

155
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
the various computers that's important

156
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,560
and on the left there's the plus pirates

157
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,080
we're just using that

158
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,240
as a way to tap into the i2c you can

159
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,639
really use whatever you want on there

160
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,400
and then the pie over here is just to

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,240
give people something to play with um

162
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,280
they don't have to bring their own

163
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,680
computer this way they can just

164
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
drive and uh work on it yeah that's

165
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
awesome well hey thank you so much

166
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,919
thanks for showing us both the other and

167
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,000
