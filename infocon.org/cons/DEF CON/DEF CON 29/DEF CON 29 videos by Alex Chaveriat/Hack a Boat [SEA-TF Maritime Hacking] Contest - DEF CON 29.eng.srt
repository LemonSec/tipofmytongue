00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:08,400
[Music]

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,200
all right we are here at the ct app

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,440
which is a competition for

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,519
maritime hacking we've got a set of

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,480
monsters behind us that are

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,680
representative of

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,760
technology that you find on a small

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,920
commercial ship or a large pledger young

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,840
so it's really interesting we've got uh

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,359
the contestants here to be able to pack

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,160
on the consoles over dan bus or 2000

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,840
we've got it running today through

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,359
tomorrow we've got a virtual competition

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,440
that's starting tomorrow for uh offline

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
analysis on data caches that are gonna

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,719
be talking tomorrow

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,879
here is the million dollar question they

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,320
score points by packing the the shift

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,879
the controls what is the ultimate goal

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,680
they're

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,120
pushing for like what's the type of

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
control they're gonna get during the

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,480
contest yeah so we've got three

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,840
subsystems that are on here steering

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,600
propulsion and navigation we've got

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,120
different flags if you guys are familiar

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
with the uh the ever given event that

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,960
happened back in uh in march one of the

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,039
flags is named after jamming the rugged

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,920
hearts hardcore and you know

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,119
that's a that's a pretty critical

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,560
failure at that point you're overriding

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,400
the physical controls with the serial

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,760
connection

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
so that's that's seeking a shift that's

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,119
a cyber season

37
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,960
so the ultimate just getting this right

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,119
yeah the ultimate goal of the contest is

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,280
to sink the ship exactly we're

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
representing like hey this is what could

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,320
happen worst case when using your

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,439
exploit

43
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,520
that's awesome it's really tempting to

44
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,280
touch every button but i don't want to

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,759
mess with anyone's ctf

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,119
but this is

47
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,200
really freaking cool

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,479
these guys right now aquaman is hacking

49
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,920
away at a virtual boat trying to sink it

50
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,399
and they're in second but man

51
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,040
oh no they're in first they're tied for

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,920
first

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,560
neck and neck right now with only a few

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,799
seconds between them they took some

55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,240
they're gonna take a quick break from

56
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,479
exploitation just to talk through some

57
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,719
of the things they've been doing so

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,280
first and foremost what attracted you

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,159
guys to this ctf did you know you were

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,320
going to do it before khan

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
no not at all i mean

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
i've done like all these kinds of online

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,038
ctfs before you know so those weren't uh

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,800
anything really special but i saw this

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
and this is something i'd never seen

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,239
before and it seemed like a once in a

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,040
you know

68
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,760
defcon opportunity

69
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
uh there's something particularly

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,640
satisfying

71
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,440
about hacking a physical system i think

72
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
uh you can see all the things move and

73
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
it's just it's just very cool it's so

74
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
cool because i'm seeing teams go up here

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
and every time like they launch an

76
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,640
exploit you see the wheel turn you see

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,840
like the

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
the gas go off the tilt of the boat go

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,599
all over the place it is so so cool so

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
with you guys scoring so high what

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,640
things have you been able to accomplish

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
so far

83
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
uh so we've basically been able to

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
hijack the boat it's pretty cool like we

85
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
can uh change the you know the throttle

86
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,599
we can steer the boat entirely and so

87
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,959
now we're working on just hacking the

88
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,400
navigation so you could send it to an

89
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,480
arbitrary destination turn on autopilot

90
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,159
stuff like that

91
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,000
how do you go about doing that like

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
obviously it's not like a normal system

93
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,560
where there's like a web admin interface

94
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
is it is it like protocol fuzzing you're

95
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,959
doing like how do you go about sending

96
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,920
like sending the malicious payload

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
so uh we record we record data from the

98
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,440
bus

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
and we look for discrepancies in the

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,239
data whenever we change a feature

101
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
on the ship and once we've identified

102
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,200
whichever whatever triggers such a

103
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
feature whatever changes for example the

104
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,959
direction of the ship we can spoof that

105
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,840
data and inject it back into the bus

106
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,720
so

107
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,080
so what you're doing is you dump the

108
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
information off you listen to it you

109
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
kind of like reverse engineer it a

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,599
little bit do you have a like are you

111
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,599
working from a technical documentation

112
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,680
for the boat

113
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
you legitimately have to go like start

114
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,400
from scratch no documentation reverse it

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
and then start trying it so okay you

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,239
pull the information off you put it on

117
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,720
your system you reverse engineer it you

118
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
now go okay like i think i know how to

119
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,239
control this i know how to control this

120
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,760
you make your payload what happens next

121
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
well then you just test it out you know

122
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,879
basically after you've captured all of

123
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,239
this data and you've you know put the

124
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,920
throttle all the way put it back put it

125
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,120
all the way and you've timed it and you

126
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,560
look at your packet capture and you say

127
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,478
oh these bytes change so these bytes are

128
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
responsible then you make your payload

129
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
and you attack you just see if it works

130
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
i mean

131
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
what what has been the most satisfying

132
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,240
feeling when you've

133
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,080
launched the exploit which one have you

134
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,160
done so far where you're like like you

135
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,919
physically see it happen you're like oh

136
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,240
that's terrifying like because we know

137
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,919
this is supposed to match a real boat

138
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,560
this isn't like a mythical like

139
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,479
i like ctf challenge where the

140
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,080
challenges don't really match real life

141
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
like what has been the most satisfying

142
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
one you found

143
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
for me the most satisfying has been

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
when we finally got control over the

145
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,840
throttle working

146
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,000
steering alone you know it's pretty cool

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,440
but once you have steering and throttle

148
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,800
you can really take the boat anywhere

149
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,199
you want and it has been both uh scary

150
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,400
and very satisfying to have that control

151
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,639
that's awesome man like you got i don't

152
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,639
want to take any more time from you guys

153
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
like man you guys are neck and neck best

154
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,919
of luck and and that's how you hack a

155
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,280
boat at def con thanks for watching and

156
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,239
hack on
