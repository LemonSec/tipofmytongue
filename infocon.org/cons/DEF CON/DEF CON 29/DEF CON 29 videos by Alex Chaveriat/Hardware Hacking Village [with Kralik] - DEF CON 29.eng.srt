1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
all right we are here in the hardware

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,160
hacking village with crawler and he has

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,040
been a goon he's been a village runner

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,720
he has done a little bit of everything

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,240
but i felt like

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,400
he is so helpful to hardware hacking

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,440
village i wanted to just talk to him so

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,680
crawling how long have you been coming

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,800
to defcon

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,119
uh since defcon 20.

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,119
holy cow that's like we're almost on

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,279
nine years at this point

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,680
so what what has been how has the

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,000
village been going so far this year it's

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
been fantastic everybody's been very

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,160
chill they're

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,600
very good and they're helping each other

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,079
yeah so like what have you seen anything

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,840
really cool like we're standing in front

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,399
of this cash register right now you said

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,680
a couple people have coming up to it

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,760
like what have they been doing with it

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,640
they

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,480
well it's been sitting in my garage for

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,760
two years

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,079
and they hacked it so that they could

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,640
open the door and see what's in it they

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
printed out a bunch of stuff off of the

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,280
printer or the the paper they've done a

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,119
lot of things to it so

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,400
that's so cool

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,320
so i probably have to have it back in my

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
garage

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,479
i'm i'm laughing because it's funny we

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,320
always look around at the soldering you

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
always have new solders who learn how to

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,280
solder but we almost forget like a lot

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
of the hardware hacking that happens is

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,759
beyond soldering beyond badge like it

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,920
comes down to like hacking cash

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,159
registers what what do you think is like

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,159
one of the coolest things that has

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,840
happened this year in the hardware

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
hacking village probably this thing i

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,439
would say

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,680
i mean having it print out things that

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,560
it was never intended to print is

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,040
definitely accomplishment i mean like i

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,479
don't even know how you would plug into

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,079
this thing like they had to have dumped

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,399
firmware

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,640
they dumped firmware they

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,040
had some sort of battery i only saw it

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,399
briefly

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,520
but they

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,479
did

57
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,799
a lot with it i haven't seen it all yet

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,920
but

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,079
i'm anxious to see what happens when i

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,640
try and plug it in at home

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,479
it's always a little terrifying when you

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,318
like bring a piece of hardware to def

63
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,959
con leave it laying around seeing what

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
people can do with it and then you risk

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
when you plug it back in seeing what

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
it's actually going to do

67
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
now that's why we that's why we

68
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,480
do this we find random hardware yard

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,160
sales or

70
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
thrift stores and we bring it in to let

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
people play

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
it is always amazing the stuff that you

73
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,959
guys find to just toss out here i

74
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,120
noticed there's like a ton of circuitry

75
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,040
over there is that mainly to teach

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
people to desolder has anyone like

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,400
picked up something from over there and

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
got it to work

79
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,720
they have they've they used a

80
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,519
what was it a wireless

81
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,560
camera

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,040
that i had and threw it in there

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,440
but yeah those are just scraps for

84
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
anybody to use

85
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,720
and play with

86
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,560
it's funny every time i see that box

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,239
over there with all the hardware you

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,760
assume it's junk like people are gonna

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
just grab it desolder it pull parts off

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
but it's always hilarious when someone

91
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,200
grabs it and gets it working

92
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
and then starts adding extra

93
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
functionality in it like that is

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
absolutely like what hardware hacking is

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,599
all about now i do have a question which

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
is how does someone get started with

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
hardware hacking here like what's the

98
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
best place to start

99
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
come in sit down

100
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,480
find you find any of the other hardware

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,799
hackers who are here

102
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,400
have you found that everyone's really

103
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
approachable everyone is and they

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,560
they will

105
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
say oh you're having trouble let me help

106
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
this is what you should do

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,120
like that

108
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
i don't know what that was but

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,959
i think it was a vcr but now it's just

110
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
to teach people to solder or to play

111
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,560
with

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,159
i love that there's just like there's

113
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,799
vcrs there's wireless cameras there's

114
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,040
all sorts of random hardware there's

115
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,120
mobile phones i swear i see like a cell

116
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,080
phone from the 90s here like that is

117
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,560
absolutely incredible well crawling

118
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,120
thank you so much for your time

119
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,519
thanks for watching and hack on
