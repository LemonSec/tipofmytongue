1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
darknet infected about 1500 people with

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,160
chlamydia at def con

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,240
and i was responsible for about a

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,919
hundred of them

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,280
let me go back and qualify that

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,080
statement see this is the darknet badge

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,440
and the badge is used to actually

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,599
compete in darknet it's just one part of

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,359
it the dark net badge had some pretty

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,880
cool hidden features in it

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,800
which were part of the contest that not

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,920
many people knew about

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
and it was kind of a hidden challenge

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
because you could get infected with

15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,039
the plague influenza or chlamydia

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,640
and that one was the most interesting

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,640
one gulo and gaori

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
and command code programmed a lot of

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,559
these things in to simulate

20
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,280
real world interactions influenza was

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,920
spread

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,320
through interactions or bluetooth so if

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,160
you came too close to someone and stayed

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,760
within that distance for a

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,840
small amount of time you could actually

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
catch the flu on your badge

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
but the coolest one was actually

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,360
chlamydia

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,920
see there's two ports at the top here

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,559
which

31
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,840
were called add-on ports or saos

32
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
with the saos what you were able to do

33
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,199
is purchase one from

34
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,280
a lot of different vendors and plug it

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,640
into your badge

36
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,560
and it would just simply light up now

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,640
what's interesting is darknet had their

38
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,360
own

39
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,159
it was this one and it was a little tiny

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,119
eggplant

41
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,880
and what you could do is plug it into

42
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,280
your badge but this one has a hidden

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
feature

44
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,320
besides just lighting up about 15

45
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,960
of these had an extra piece of code in

46
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
them and you would plug them into your

47
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,040
badge

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
which now infected the badge with

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,880
chlamydia so now when a

50
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,759
clean eggplant entered your badge it

51
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,720
would infect

52
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,040
that eggplant and then spread to other

53
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,320
badges so

54
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,119
you can infect other badges either by

55
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,360
putting in a clean eggplant

56
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
into your badge and then that moving

57
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
elsewhere

58
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,360
or take your infected eggplant which you

59
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
start with and plugging it into

60
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
others now something you might be asking

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,320
yourself is who would allow

62
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,399
some random stranger to come up like an

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,840
eggplant into their badge

64
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,640
well a couple jerks went around claiming

65
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,280
that their eggplant leds weren't working

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,160
and try it out in everyone else's badge

67
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,758
which spread chlamydia

68
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,000
throughout all those clean badges which

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,879
would then

70
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,800
spread to all the other ones close to

71
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
the end of the conference almost

72
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
1500 players were infected with

73
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,040
chlamydia besides the flu and the plague

74
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,720
and we learn at least one valuable

75
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
lesson which is don't trust anyone who

76
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
says their eggplant is clean if you want

77
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,160
to hear about some other shenanigans we

78
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,599
get up to at defcon

79
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,040
hear about how two friends of mine

80
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,599
infiltrated defcon using a urinal cake

81
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,879
or this other video overall don't trust

82
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,720
any hacker who says they have a clean

83
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
eggplant

84
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,518
thanks for watching
