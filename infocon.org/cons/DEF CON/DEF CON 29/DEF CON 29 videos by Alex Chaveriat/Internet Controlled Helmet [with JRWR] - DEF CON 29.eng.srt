1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
we are back with jrwr talking about

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,359
his crazy hard hat it has

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,800
4chan api calls or connections

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,400
it has crazy led lights on it

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
it has a full-blown access point

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,039
it has so much tech in it and he has

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,480
already impressed us

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,000
so much with connecting the defcon badge

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
out to the internet for all of us to get

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,920
to if you haven't checked out that video

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,800
i'll link it

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,920
somewhere here but right now let's talk

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,320
about

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,440
his hard hat at defcon

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,719
29 so what does it

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,480
do it looks incredible here i'm gonna

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,640
hand this to you you talk about it and i

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,440
will just get

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,960
shots of it right now uh so this is hat

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,920
chan here

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
and so what hat chan is is first off

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,840
it's 499

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
leds of awesomeness so this uses a

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,199
custom circuit board that i had printed

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,320
and designed

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,719
uh they're all neopixels in a daisy

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,760
chain

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,159
and they all support holding uh shitty

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,320
add-ons as well so i can really deck it

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,840
out with all my shitty add-ons

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,439
so uh it's running through a demo reel

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,600
from the fast led library here

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,360
and it seemed to just work out extremely

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,439
well in the process it's being ran by a

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,320
single

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,640
18 mega that i got hidden underneath the

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,720
router there

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
so the power system on the back is the

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,200
newest innovation for the

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,520
the hardhat group i'm using a single

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,840
rj45 connection to a cat6 cable

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
uh to handle 48 watts of power

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,479
into the hat i'm using dual

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,920
12 volt rails coming in from a giant

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,439
battery pack which i'll show here

46
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,920
you in a moment i got some voltages on

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
the back that you can see

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,360
and then i got the wireless router here

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,600
on the back with my university's log of

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,040
rochester institute of

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
technology so um

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,880
it did have a three volt rail for the

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,119
saos but three volts is hard with this

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:05,680
much

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,720
this much power and the magnetic

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,479
coupling issues that i was having

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
magnets are hard so

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,640
uh this all came about for my original

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
uh

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
hard hat that i was wearing which was uh

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
hat chan 1.0 which you probably all saw

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
at some point

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,959
uh in the last four years at 10.1 was

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,319
the pith helmet with the

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,120
dual led strains and wi-fi antennas well

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,519
it's even better is this wi-fi router

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,360
which i'll pull up here on my phone

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
is an image board you can connect to the

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,519
open wireless access point on it

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,000
and then you can you can post to my uh

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
post to my hat just like you would on

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
4chan

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,080
and then you can pretty much just ship

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,280
post to my hat i've got

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,360
five years of posts on here

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
yeah here we go this is the old board

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
from defcon 27 going back

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
i have 20 pages of stuff

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,920
you can find copies of this image board

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
on the internet archive as well for when

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,040
i copied it on defcon 27.

82
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,640
so um that actually is how i got my

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,959
my career started in cyber security is

84
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,680
because of that stupid hat

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,959
so i wanted a conversation piece and

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,799
i had a history with that pith helmet

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,440
anyway so i just decked it out real hard

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,480
and i had some stuff

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,159
on and i wanted to provide a service

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,480
because i'm a web developer

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,239
you know that's what i do in my past

92
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,799
time right so ain't hatch m 1.0 you can

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,879
probably find defcon 25 photos of it

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,720
from an eonigo but

95
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,120
it's actually what started the hard hat

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,799
group

97
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,080
because we noticed that there was kind

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,239
of a synergy of people having these hard

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,640
hats with crazy stuff on it

100
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,080
um but my my boss found me in the vendor

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,640
area

102
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,120
and said hey i need a pen tester you

103
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,680
look like

104
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,720
one mind you

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,360
i have no certs i have no schooling i'm

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
just a nerd

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
what i'm good at but the best of us are

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,360
right now i'm just a turbo nerd okay so

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,079
uh and it's just gotten crazier and

110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,320
crazier over the years for sure

111
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,040
um but this is the the latest iteration

112
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
that i've come up with

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
um so here hold this for a second let me

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,919
grab

115
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
i mean this thing is truly incredible

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,320
like when it lights up

117
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
you can see it from across the room i am

118
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
so glad he was wearing it because that's

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,400
what made me come on over to him

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
originally

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
and hear about this crazy like just a

122
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,040
hard hat con this whole mini con that

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
happens inside def con

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,040
it's it's amazing i love seeing these

125
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,199
things

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,560
okay so we got a little bit more to the

127
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,919
power here so you can see i have my

128
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
ethernet coming in

129
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
and then this is where it gets really

130
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
janky so i have

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,240
two static 12 volt triggers for my

132
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,880
battery

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,840
for a qualcomm quick charge 3.0 so it

134
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,680
tells the battery i want 12 volts and i

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,199
want all of it

136
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,479
and so it's connected into this

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,400
connector here with some a lot of

138
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,280
kept on tape here and it's going into

139
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,560
and i'm surprised they let me on the

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
plane with this

141
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,000
50 000 milliamp hour battery

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,120
this bad boy here will last me 19

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
hours of run time

144
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
with the hat pulling 48 watts

145
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,520
did you get stopped by security on your

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,479
way in

147
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,840
they just let it right through they

148
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,039
didn't even respect my bags or anything

149
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,360
i get stopped for a pound of coffee

150
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,320
yet this thing makes it through that's

151
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,960
crap

152
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,360
tsa if you're watching which i know

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,240
you're not because it's defcon and

154
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,960
i'll leave that one there um my gosh

155
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,639
like this is incredible

156
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,600
like really really incredible so this

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
whole thing came on and came out playing

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,479
with me

159
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,759
this got checked the hat did in a big

160
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,360
pelican case and then uh the batteries

161
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
and the cables

162
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,919
came in with me on carry on it made me

163
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,800
check it anyway

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,039
halfway through the flight because bwi

165
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,800
likes to do that

166
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,440
so they're really crazy about that

167
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
i mean this is incredible like thank you

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,440
so much for sharing this
