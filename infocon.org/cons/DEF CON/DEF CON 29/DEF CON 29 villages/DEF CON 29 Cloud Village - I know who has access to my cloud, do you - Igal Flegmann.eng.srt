1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,720
yeah so uh as mike was talking it's kind

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,080
of hard to

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,399
manage access to cloud and see who has

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,919
access and everything so in this talk

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,280
we're gonna talk about kind of like some

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
of the security best practices that i've

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,519
learned working at microsoft and then

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,640
like the tool that my company created

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,400
so we're going to start with a little

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,080
bit about myself

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,160
so i'm an identity security engineer

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,359
with years of experience creating

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,080
identity and pki services for microsoft

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,840
and then after a few years decided to

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,320
leave and co-found ketos where we create

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,200
pki services easy to use pki services to

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,719
kind of make the world a password-less

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,600
place

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,360
uh and then there's my twitter handle if

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,800
you have any questions feel free to send

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,960
them there and also send them

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,640
in to the cloud village and we'll answer

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,559
them at the end and here's a picture of

24
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
me outside uh since i didn't know we

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,079
were gonna talk about rowing i wanted to

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
show that sometimes i go outside too

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,719
so uh let's start with something that we

28
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,280
can all agree on humans suck like

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,879
they're slow to respond when there's an

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,039
outage they get hacked because they

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,480
don't follow your recommendations and

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
they can't scale but they

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,119
they don't follow your recommendation so

34
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,720
they will still go on facebook they'll

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
still click that phishing email and why

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,320
because we're humans we make mistakes

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
they can't scale we we can't go all the

38
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,159
way

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
to cloud scale and having hundreds and

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,720
thousands of machines as mike was saying

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,439
like automation is taking over and we

42
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,360
should take over uh it doesn't make

43
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,040
sense to people still going in and

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,520
clicking through and creating vms so we

45
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,799
have to

46
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,320
try to get them out of the equation as

47
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,479
much as possible but also understand

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,119
when we're designing our security policy

49
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,280
they're not going to be perfect humans

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,360
having

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,600
doing everything perfectly like

52
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,520
count that they might choose a bad

53
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
password and help them do the right

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,560
thing the easiest way

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,799
so in this talk i'm gonna start by first

56
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,159
talking about like kind of like the

57
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
cloud best uh security best practices

58
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,799
i'm gonna go through each one of them so

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,280
i'm not gonna read them out right now

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,840
so first one is keep management identity

61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,719
ideally to zero so uh mike in the

62
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,280
previous talk was also talking about

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,360
pim and adjusting time access

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,959
so um

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,239
it's something we're going to talk about

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,400
but the first thing we have to do is

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,239
infrastructure as code

68
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,160
if you don't have the humans go in and

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,360
click through and everything and they

70
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,040
don't really have to go to the portal as

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,599
much it will make it easier for them to

72
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,239
not have access to

73
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,560
to to the infrastructure and

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,319
harder to hackers to get in when humans

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,959
don't have access and the the way to

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
make this is making it easier for them

77
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,400
so one of the things we have learned at

78
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,040
ketos is that one of our most visited

79
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,200
sites is our docs page where we talk

80
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,079
about how to deploy

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,120
cloud vms with already ssh certificates

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,959
in them the reason for that it's easier

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
to just go to one site that has all the

84
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,640
information than to have to go and

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,319
figure it out and if that information

86
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,239
has the best practices then your users

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,280
are just going to follow the best

88
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,920
practices so encourage

89
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,080
arm templates server form templates

90
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
blooming templates whatever your

91
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
organization uses to make it easy for

92
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,200
the user to do the right thing maybe

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
create some with the ports closed and

94
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,560
all that

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,319
stuff and then as i was saying about

96
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,640
just in time access so one of the things

97
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,480
that justin time access gives you is

98
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,680
first of all you don't have access all

99
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,519
the time so it makes it a little bit

100
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,680
harder to scan and it also gives you the

101
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,760
ability to have dual key approval dual

102
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,319
key approval helps because then you need

103
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,720
another account compromise and you need

104
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
to convince someone at microsoft we had

105
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
to do it that like i would go in person

106
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,519
or like call my manager and be like hey

107
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,280
i need access to this please approve

108
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
this which is very hard for a hacker to

109
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,319
be able to uh

110
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,319
imitate that so

111
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,120
uh

112
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,720
having dual key approval having some

113
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,319
policy that the user has to actually

114
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,319
talk to the other person will really

115
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,480
help mitigate some of the attacks

116
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,319
and the other one it also makes it hard

117
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,080
it makes it hard to get into

118
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,480
the infrastructure forcing people to to

119
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,920
do the first thing that we were talking

120
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
about infrastructure as code and

121
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,360
automate some of the stuff if it

122
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
is if it's going to take you a while to

123
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
get in every time you have to get in

124
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
then you're going to find ways to

125
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
automate yourself out of it

126
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
and then

127
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,280
we we have talked about uh how we're

128
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,799
trying to get out of it but you also

129
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,959
have to have a strong identity so one of

130
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,399
the things

131
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
that we do at ketos and many companies

132
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,320
do as well is having a completely

133
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
isolated identity

134
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,400
that your email identity is going to be

135
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
compromised because you're checking

136
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,440
email you

137
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,919
you'll get phished and

138
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,199
bad things are gonna happen to that

139
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
account if you use it a lot you enter it

140
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,960
for multiple sites so the user is kind

141
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,400
of like train

142
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,479
a password and and move on with their

143
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,759
life

144
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
so if you create an isolated identity

145
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,280
that you only use for production so

146
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
you're only using it in aws or you're

147
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
using only using it in azure that kind

148
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,840
of helps your users

149
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
only think that that identity is for

150
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,759
that and it's harder to get fished

151
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,280
so something to keep in mind that you

152
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,840
can have two different identities

153
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
and those identities should have mfa

154
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
nowadays with cloud there's no reason

155
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,919
you shouldn't have mfa i'm a big fan of

156
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
fido and piv and hello for business

157
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
because i worked on some of those

158
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
technologies or because it's the best

159
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
way

160
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
to work with

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
for humans like it's way harder for a

162
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
human to remember a 20 character

163
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,479
password and have

164
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,560
400 different passwords for all their

165
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,880
accounts uh but it's very easy for a

166
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
human to

167
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
grab their ubi key and plug it in

168
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,880
and get access to

169
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,960
enter a pin and get access so it's way

170
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
easier to remember

171
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
and it's a better user experience i

172
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,919
actually prefer having this and typing

173
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,560
six things instead of having to have a

174
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
big password and cell phone

175
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
and the other one is you can do

176
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
conditional access that i'll cover a

177
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
little bit more in another slide but

178
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,759
basically

179
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,919
it allows you to have

180
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,919
if the user hasn't logged in in a while

181
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,639
like ask for mfa although i recommend

182
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,120
asking mfa for each time and if the

183
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,199
computer is not compliant you can

184
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,680
block the

185
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,199
the access

186
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,360
and then as i said humans are always

187
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
going to try to find a way to get in

188
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
late the lazy way and one of the ways

189
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
that they do that is creating a service

190
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,759
principle a service account that with a

191
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,880
password and then they can set the

192
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,639
password whatever they want so if you

193
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,160
set up all the mfa and everything they

194
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,479
can still set up a password and bypass

195
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,120
that so have some policy that you cannot

196
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,400
create

197
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
pulls with passwords and also you

198
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
shouldn't use passwords for service

199
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,639
service

200
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,360
certificates are out there use pki

201
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,160
and the last one i want to talk to

202
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,319
is remove vm password so

203
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,080
most vms

204
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,840
in cloud like aws and azure and jcp will

205
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
come with a default password that you

206
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
set and it's like a local account

207
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,440
make that automate that in your uh

208
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,680
in your scripts when you're creating

209
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,199
that it's just a random password that no

210
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,880
one has access to

211
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,800
and don't use that password the reason

212
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,840
for that is you don't want to have a

213
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,280
shared account and also the engineer

214
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
that is creating the vm will have that

215
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,280
password and if they leave or in the

216
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,440
insider thread like they can still

217
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,039
recommend using

218
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,160
your azure active directory passwords or

219
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
basically your they need to provide your

220
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,160
passwords to access your vms and there's

221
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
a lot of tools that do it like

222
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
uh you can domain join your machines and

223
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,319
for linux there's many tools we actually

224
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,120
create in keto is one of those tools so

225
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,560
there is a lot of tools out there that

226
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
you can use

227
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
and then uh the other one is keep your

228
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,199
network closed i don't know why

229
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,680
everybody decided it was okay to open

230
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
all the ports uh maybe it's

231
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,599
about earlier that

232
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,879
it's just people don't

233
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,400
like before it was like the network

234
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,319
engineer making sure that the firework

235
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,520
firewall and everything was close and

236
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,199
now everybody has access

237
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:51,919
but

238
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,280
from going from like completely a

239
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,960
firewall to being completely open we

240
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
should still keep just necessary ports

241
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
open be very strict about your ip ranges

242
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,440
so no your whole corporate doesn't need

243
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,000
access to manage your vms like your

244
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
management board should probably be

245
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,039
closed all the time

246
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,240
and maybe have some ip addresses and

247
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,440
same with service to service

248
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,280
authentication not all services talk to

249
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,879
each other just have the specific ip

250
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,800
addresses of the services that talk to

251
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,479
this specific service have access to the

252
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,720
service there is no reason to have a

253
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
completely open network

254
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,479
and then networking jits so that goes

255
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,520
back to the

256
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
management ports

257
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
so azure offers is networking just in

258
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
time access which means that it when you

259
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,000
need access to the port is always closed

260
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,839
no

261
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
no port no no ip has access

262
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,519
and

263
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,159
okay sorry

264
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,240
no no no port has access to

265
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
[Music]

266
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
to the machine and then uh

267
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
when you need access it will just

268
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
request access for you

269
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,920
i got a hurry up here so i'm gonna keep

270
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
keep going

271
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,080
uh the strong device so a strong device

272
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,160
so you manage your identity you secure

273
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,760
your identity you do all this great

274
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,880
things for

275
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
keeping your identity secure

276
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,240
but then if you have a device with

277
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
malware they can still steal your token

278
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
and do stuff like that so you have to

279
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,560
have your device managed make sure that

280
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
they get scanned and they have proper

281
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,279
policies as you can see for the medium i

282
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,760
prefer intune is way easier than ad gpos

283
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
and it's cloud-based and easier to

284
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,279
manage and you can use conditional

285
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,200
access based on this device health so if

286
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
the device has been scanning everything

287
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,640
they give you access if that doesn't

288
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
it'll block access even if you have the

289
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,880
correct credentials and then

290
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
generally we use isolated device for

291
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,160
production so this is something that

292
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
some companies do it's kind of going the

293
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
extra mile

294
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
um but we're an identity security

295
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,600
company so we go the extra mile that you

296
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,040
have a completely different device that

297
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,120
you only access production with so you

298
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
have your dev machine that is where i'm

299
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,399
presenting this

300
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
you have your email and everything

301
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,000
actually touch the production you have

302
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to open another device and log in with

303
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,680
production identity so your production

304
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
identity is always in that device so a

305
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
compromise to this device wouldn't give

306
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,560
me access to the device identity

307
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
and the last one is use

308
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
cloud tools so you have the azure

309
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,200
security center that will help you with

310
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
compliance and help you with some stuff

311
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,079
when you're moving to the cloud that you

312
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,839
might oversee like hey you left all the

313
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,360
ports open you should probably close

314
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,959
some of the ports the other one is

315
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,279
managed service identities it allows you

316
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,279
to

317
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,640
manage your identities for you and this

318
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,079
is all azure

319
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,880
i i mostly use azure so all my

320
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
terminologies in azure but most of these

321
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
cloud providers have the same like so

322
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,079
you just have to translate it to your

323
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,000
cloud provider so manage service

324
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,920
identities will the cloud provider will

325
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,760
manage the password for you this makes

326
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
it hard for a user to get at the

327
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,399
password and use it and it also avoids

328
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,000
outages such as

329
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
bad password rotations or anything so

330
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,480
using manage identities is great for

331
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,640
availability and it's great for security

332
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,920
and for the passwords that you can use

333
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,560
that you should use azure key vault kms

334
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,839
any of the password vaults that will

335
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,440
allow the services to access the volts

336
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
and you can rotate them and have all

337
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,959
your policies to to do all that stuff

338
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
and and once again if you make it easy

339
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,360
put it put some code samples out there

340
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,200
and be like hey this is how you get your

341
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,279
passwords from a key vault or this is

342
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,680
how you get your passwords for of this

343
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,959
how you authenticate with the managed

344
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,600
service uh service identities it makes

345
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
it easier for your developers to use the

346
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
right tools and instead of them having

347
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,440
to figure it out on their own and also

348
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
makes a better uh experience for the

349
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,640
security team

350
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,079
i always thought that security teams

351
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:32,800
should

352
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,320
people should come out with security

353
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
meetings instead of with more tasks to

354
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
do with ways to improve so they look

355
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,079
forward to those security meetings

356
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,079
instead of dreading like oh i have to go

357
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,600
to another security meeting so let's see

358
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
how we get delayed this time

359
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,839
and then i already talked about pim

360
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
networking jit and intune so those are

361
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
some that i already covered in the talk

362
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,360
and then monitor everything

363
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,680
so you should have your sim up and

364
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
running with alerts uh azure security

365
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,720
center it has some alerts but

366
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
and then turn logs on every service even

367
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,600
if you're not reading all the services

368
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,839
you have to turn on the logs just to

369
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,839
have forensics if something bad happens

370
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
you want to be able to go back and look

371
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,959
so

372
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
don't save those extra few dollars turn

373
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,680
on logs on every single

374
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
you run

375
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,959
and also run your own custom alerts and

376
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,120
code because some of the things they get

377
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,639
through infrastructure but one of the

378
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,240
things that we did great at microsoft

379
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,360
was we had some trainings that said

380
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,959
everybody had to do them and we would

381
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,240
talk about security the red team would

382
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,760
go up there and say like hey this is how

383
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,279
we get in and this is how you guys can

384
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,839
stop us so then like the engineers are

385
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,880
aware of it and you write um

386
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
you write different

387
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,800
alerts and here i have an example of one

388
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
that we actually write uh we have i'm

389
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,959
not going to show exactly what we log in

390
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,600
where this is but somewhere in our code

391
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,320
we log this and the engineer on call

392
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,839
will get a call saying like hey someone

393
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,480
is trying to mess with our apis let's

394
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
track that

395
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,519
so

396
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,279
basically if you follow this we solve

397
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,440
security uh you will never get hacked no

398
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,800
i'm kidding

399
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
this just is not a silver bullet these

400
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,040
are just best practices and that's the

401
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,440
thing even if you follow all this you

402
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,320
can't

403
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
make a mistake something's gonna happen

404
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
and a hacker can still get in

405
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,720
so

406
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
i'm going to talk about some of the back

407
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
doors that i've seen people do and then

408
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,519
i'm going to talk about cloud watcher

409
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,560
our tool

410
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,800
that uh

411
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
that we have created

412
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,399
so the first one is adding

413
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,160
so if you have your groups that are

414
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,279
echoed like you might have like your

415
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,839
engineering group and that group gets

416
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,839
hackled into your subscriptions if you

417
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,279
add an extra member in there it's a

418
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,480
group that you don't check the

419
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,639
membership that often so having that

420
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,279
extra member will give them access to

421
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,040
all the stuff your engineers have access

422
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,839
but you won't notice

423
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,000
having an administrator so this is once

424
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
again azure specific classic

425
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,680
administrators was a way of doing things

426
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,959
like four years ago we have been trying

427
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,199
to facing them out since then

428
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,199
and

429
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
now they they have moved them to another

430
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,000
uh tab which is great less chances of

431
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,320
people creating them but it's also

432
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
harder to detect when someone adds one

433
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,399
so if like a hacker adds one it's harder

434
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,240
to detect that there's one than that

435
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
they have uh

436
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
another one that i used to love when i

437
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,279
was doing pen testing is adding a

438
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,040
service principle as a contributor to

439
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,079
the subscription and if you put like the

440
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,680
player somewhere in the name no one

441
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,000
wants to break deployments so no one is

442
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,480
going to touch it so something to make

443
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
sure that you're keeping track of and

444
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,880
usually deployment has contributor

445
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,639
access because you have to create and

446
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,920
delete resources this one is more

447
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,639
developers being lazy that it's um

448
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,639
removing the azure active directory

449
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,480
authentication only so

450
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
they might want to create a password

451
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,959
for sql and just use that instead of

452
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,440
their active directory account so having

453
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,320
that checked uh forces them to use azure

454
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,920
active directory

455
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,279
uh add more

456
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,279
permissions to ikv

457
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,519
so um

458
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,600
this one is if you have all these

459
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,560
different permissions like let's say a

460
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,399
developer only has list permissions but

461
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,560
it doesn't have get if they get the get

462
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
permission now they can steal the the

463
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,000
code uh the

464
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
the secret and use it so keeping track

465
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,440
of that it's kind of hard because when

466
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,480
you're looking at the keyboard you're

467
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,600
like yeah they should have some

468
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,920
permission so that's about right then

469
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,680
adding ip addresses to a firewall this

470
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,959
one is one

471
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,720
match when you have like a long list of

472
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
ip addresses and you just add one there

473
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,360
might be a developer being lazy maybe a

474
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
hacker from

475
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,959
else trying to get in so

476
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,600
catching one is kind of hard if you have

477
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,399
uh

478
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,240
if they try to remove the rule or

479
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,759
something it's easy but catching one is

480
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,079
kind of hard for a human so we created a

481
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,600
solution that kind of

482
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,560
monitors all those back doors and

483
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
it's basically a powershell model module

484
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,000
that runs in azure automation you can

485
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,079
get it from the azure powershell gallery

486
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,160
it's all free we basically used it

487
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
internally and decided to open source it

488
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,440
like we this is not one of our products

489
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,800
or anything we don't make any money out

490
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,240
of it we just wanted to share with the

491
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,839
security community

492
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,079
uh scans your subscription and detect

493
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
any of the configurations changes that i

494
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,600
mentioned

495
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,839
and alerts you if the change has been

496
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,680
detected so here you can see no changes

497
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,839
have been detected this is kind of like

498
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,600
a run that um

499
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
would be fine

500
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,440
and then here we show one that it hasn't

501
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
been detected and we have it that it

502
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,000
fails the runbook whenever something is

503
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,399
detected and then we set up an alert

504
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,240
that when a round book fails it calls

505
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,800
our on-call engineer so here you can see

506
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,600
we added some stuff and it failed

507
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
so what it covers our back changes so if

508
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,360
something gets added to the r back or to

509
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,959
a uh

510
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,880
it will detect it and let you know

511
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,120
because production access should be very

512
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,279
monitored classic administrator changes

513
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,199
so we'll alert if that classic

514
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,360
administrator is changed azure resource

515
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,639
provider uh changes so this one is uh

516
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,600
azure

517
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,439
resources get access through azure

518
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,000
research providers and you can and they

519
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,760
get kind of like automatically added to

520
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,959
your subscription but you can create

521
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,039
custom ones so for example like one of

522
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,720
the ways that i like explaining it is

523
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
like the azure resource provider for key

524
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,799
vault has access to the vms so they can

525
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,959
encrypt the disks so it can give you

526
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,480
some access to the

527
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,919
resources so we just like to keep it

528
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,480
clean so we added it for monitoring

529
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,720
research creation and deletion

530
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
this might seem a little bit harmless

531
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
but if someone adds a vm that then

532
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
they're using for tests but it's not

533
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,080
production network and then that doesn't

534
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,160
get patched it could

535
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,240
it can be a way in later so it's

536
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
important to keep everything clean and

537
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
also if someone deletes something

538
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
in a production subscription you should

539
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
be alerted because you don't know if

540
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,360
it's something that happened by mistake

541
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,799
and all of a sudden you one of your

542
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,039
availability zones is down and you'll

543
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,360
eventually have a disaster or something

544
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
so it's important to keep track of that

545
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,360
change of group members risk there we

546
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,919
only do nested groups uh sorry we don't

547
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,440
do nested groups so we only do first

548
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,080
degree so any group that is anywhere in

549
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,520
your subscription will monitor the

550
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
membership to make sure that nothing has

551
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
changed

552
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,919
sql firewall changes so if a firewall

553
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,919
rule gets added a single ip or something

554
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,360
will

555
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,160
do

556
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,720
sql server aad admin changes

557
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,200
so as i mentioned if they like uncheck

558
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,280
the aed only or they change the admin

559
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,880
group or anything

560
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,160
we'll alert azure keyboard uh access

561
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,679
policy

562
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,039
so once again

563
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,960
uh those are the ones that i talked

564
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
about that like changing the how many

565
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,600
permissions you have into the

566
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,640
azure keyboard firewall changes

567
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,360
so

568
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,720
i'm going to address the elephant in the

569
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,640
room maybe of you might be thinking like

570
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,799
he already talked about cloud tools why

571
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
isn't he just using azure security

572
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,640
center and like sentinel and the reason

573
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,240
is like those

574
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,039
don't cover all this stuff so we use the

575
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,160
all of those

576
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,600
plus this

577
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
so we have all our detections and

578
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
everything but this is more kind of like

579
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,520
making sure that nothing has changed

580
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,440
because azure security center it's not

581
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,720
going to alert you if someone adds an

582
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,240
extra

583
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
person to a group that seems pretty

584
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
normal or if someone has an extra ip

585
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
address that's something that my

586
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,160
service got a new ip address or

587
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,280
something so

588
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,880
this one we keep it just because we want

589
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
to make sure that everything

590
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,360
we get alerted and we know if something

591
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,120
changes

592
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,039
so now i'm going to talk about how we

593
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,960
set it up uh this is a great picture of

594
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
how we actually set it up

595
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
and then here i kind of

596
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,640
make it easier uh we just have one cloud

597
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,679
watcher in this one but every

598
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,039
subscription would have a cloud watcher

599
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,039
watching in the other subscriptions

600
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,400
and you have your production

601
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,520
subscription in this case that is the

602
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
one we're watching you have a cloud

603
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,400
watcher in this subscription that

604
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,160
ideally has different identity

605
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,679
management

606
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,240
than the original so like you don't have

607
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
the same administrator so a compromise

608
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
and one identity doesn't compromise the

609
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,480
other one

610
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,760
and then you have the baseline in a

611
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,360
different subscription so as a

612
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,880
compromise in this one doesn't

613
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
compromise the baseline which this one

614
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,520
only has read

615
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,200
we actually keep this one in a different

616
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,880
tenant a whole different setup um

617
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,320
but so

618
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
yeah so this one will read the baseline

619
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,320
which is basically a json file and then

620
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,440
it'll compare it to your resources

621
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
so what's next the next thing we want to

622
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,000
attack is uh create a ui to visualize

623
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
our resources and kind of like alert on

624
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
certain things

625
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,720
that might be

626
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,120
a vulnerability

627
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,919
so

628
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,520
um

629
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,480
like

630
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,559
you you we we would show kind of like

631
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,600
all the

632
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
resources and say like hey like it seems

633
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,840
like this is very open you should check

634
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,440
that and that that will help us because

635
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,400
we think

636
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,640
security um

637
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,880
security reviews

638
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,080
don't

639
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,840
like all diagrams so like having

640
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,039
something up to date that you can

641
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,640
actually use for a security review and

642
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,520
actually

643
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,880
being based on the scan of your

644
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,240
subscription instead of what you think

645
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,679
the service looks like

646
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,400
will help a lot with the security then

647
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,159
add more resources as you saw right now

648
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,600
is kind of limited but we're a small

649
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
company that doesn't use many types of

650
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
resources so that's one of the reasons

651
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,960
we're open sourcing it if you want to

652
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
use it and you want to add your own

653
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,559
resources please feel free to make a

654
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,559
pull request and not them and then the

655
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
last one is we want to integrate with

656
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,039
pollubi terraform and

657
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,520
all the other providers to be able to

658
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,080
match the baseline also to your

659
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,679
infrastructure as code to make sure that

660
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,720
nothing is changing from your

661
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
infrastructure infrastructures code to

662
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,520
the actual

663
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,440
console

664
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,400
and once again thank you so much

665
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,480
here's the link to the

666
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,440
uh

667
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,280
to the github project

668
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
here are the slides and i actually also

669
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
created a set of videos so make sure to

670
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
check that out i'll just go through the

671
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,760
whole things of how to set it up

672
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
