00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,319
hi i'm giggs welcome to when electronics

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,559
and deception collide a short talk about

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,759
historical and modern uses of technology

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,719
to mislead and deceive

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,200
i'm the

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,680
founder of compound electronics on

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,840
freenode may she rest in peace we've

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,840
moved over to libera chat if you haven't

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,760
moved with us yet

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,599
i've been a volunteer at the hhv for

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,480
about eight years

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,519
ish

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,119
now

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,039
regarding this talk keep in mind that

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,079
this is all hobby stuff for me i might

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,079
be wrong about something

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so what can be seen cannot be unseen

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,360
we'll obviously get a lot more into this

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,440
later but there are elements to

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,079
polygraph testing that don't really work

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,840
right if a person being examined knows

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,440
how they work

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,800
if you need to do this for your job

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
consider whether you should continue

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,160
watching this or not

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,399
that said everything in this

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,120
presentation is public information there

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,920
shouldn't be anything secret

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,600
you have been warned

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,519
related to the idea that knowing how a

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,240
test works can ruin the test back in

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,680
2009 i used to edit wikipedia i noticed

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,840
the debate raging on the back and

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,360
discussion pages about the rorschach

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,119
inkblot test

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,040
regarding whether the images for the

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,240
test which had fallen into the public

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,759
domain should be published

39
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,759
you may think that a test where you look

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,520
at random images of inkblots wouldn't

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,520
have the correct answers or incorrect

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,680
answers but that's not the case the test

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,759
actually has a set of same answers and a

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
set of insane answers and

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,119
those are the incorrect and incorrect

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,560
answers

47
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,880
i wrote up a small blurb about the

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,439
debate for slashdot which got posted on

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,920
the front page in 2009

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,399
i expected that would be the end of it

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,399
a geeky story about slashdot or four

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
slashdot about an argument within

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,079
wikipedia and that's it

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
turns out

55
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,880
that gnome cohen a reporter for the new

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
york times also apparently read slashdot

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,719
he picked up the story it caused the big

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,240
media flurry there were morning news

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,880
shows where they were broadcasting the

60
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,840
actual rorschach images where they were

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,959
giving each other the test playing games

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,560
seeing if they would get the right

63
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,560
answers or not

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
despite this leak in the strong evidence

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,400
that the test is suited scientific it's

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
still sometimes used in court cases

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,440
so on to the actual topic of the talk

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,800
electronic deception

69
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
one of the earliest writings that

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,520
documents electricity other than

71
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,520
lightning

72
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,879
is already ascribing powers to it that

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,959
it doesn't have

74
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,319
plenty of the elder wrote extensively on

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,400
natural remedies around 77 a.d including

76
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,280
the electric torpedo fish which he said

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,440
could

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
numb the most vigorous arm and rivet the

79
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,800
feet of the best runner

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,800
he then goes on to list nine very

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
questionable medical treatments based on

82
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
the mysterious powers of this fish

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,480
including one for precedence of the

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,640
rectum

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,840
which apparently either means prolapse

86
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,200
or hemorrhoids it wasn't entirely clear

87
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
and it's treated by applying the

88
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,519
electric fish topically i don't know if

89
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,400
they mean alive or ground up but either

90
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
way

91
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,519
sounds pretty gross

92
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,400
skipping forward eighteen hundred years

93
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,319
or so not very long after the early work

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
in harnessing electricity and magnetism

95
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,840
had just been done

96
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,599
one of the first non-scientific uses of

97
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,959
electricity was in the stage show of

98
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,720
robert hooden

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,879
his trick with the light and heavy chest

100
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,040
was to invite a boy and a strong man

101
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,519
from the audience a small boy could lift

102
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,440
the chest while the strong man could not

103
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,480
it relied on a strong electromagnet

104
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,480
under the stage and a metal steel plate

105
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
in the bottom of the box and he would

106
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,080
turn the electromagnet on and off to

107
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,360
control whether the box was light or

108
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
heavy

109
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,200
most of the audiences at the time had no

110
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,640
idea what electromagnetism was it had

111
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,400
only really been discovered and

112
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,400
documented 30 years before this

113
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,840
moving on to a slightly more

114
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,439
controversial topic nikola tesla tesla

115
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,920
invented and proved numerous things we

116
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,439
still use today but he was also intense

117
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,200
especially toward the end of selling

118
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,400
this idea of long-range wireless

119
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,159
electricity

120
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,319
he gave shows where he he would hold

121
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,920
lamps and strong electric fields and

122
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,519
they would light despite not being

123
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,799
connected to anything

124
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,640
most of us have seen similar

125
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,440
demonstrations of fluorescent tubes

126
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,199
under power lines and things like that

127
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,040
and they light up

128
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,320
the problem is the electric fields drop

129
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
off with the inverse square of the

130
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,240
distance despite tesla's claims

131
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
otherwise

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
so was tesla being deceptive it's hard

133
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,520
to say he probably believed what he was

134
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,080
saying that's the problem that runs deep

135
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,320
when you look at these issues

136
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,840
separating the charlatan from the true

137
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,680
believer

138
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,120
is not always easy

139
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,720
what we're about to look at are a few

140
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,400
technologies that certainly have their

141
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
share of true believers

142
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,880
if you yourself haven't if you yourself

143
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,720
happen to be a true believer don't take

144
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,479
this as a personal attack but maybe take

145
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,919
a step back and evaluate whether your

146
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,919
belief is misplaced or not

147
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
so first a personal anecdote my uncle

148
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,360
recently

149
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,120
called the carpet cleaning service and

150
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,600
they brought in these high-powered uv

151
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,520
lights to detect cat urine

152
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
they proceeded to say his entire house

153
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,199
was covered in cat urine that they'd

154
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
need to tear out all the carpets and

155
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,600
replace at least the pads

156
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,160
my mom showed me these pictures the

157
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,039
thing is uv light causes many things to

158
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,919
fluoresce not just urine spilled food

159
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,479
liquid detergents club soda lemon juice

160
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,240
toothpaste it's a pretty big list

161
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,600
i mean yeah that carpet's pretty dirty

162
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,600
but maybe give the cat a break

163
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,840
so what makes a good modern deception

164
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,080
prop we can look at the field of ghost

165
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,840
hunting for some easy examples

166
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,400
it should be something that produces

167
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,600
noisy fuzzy output with lots of

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,440
artifacts preferably not totally random

169
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,720
but with some kind of opaque internal

170
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,720
functioning

171
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
the vague property of being sciency

172
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,960
helps link credibility as well

173
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,280
people want to see patterns they want to

174
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,039
confirm what they already believe

175
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
these sorts of devices are tools of

176
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,880
confirmation bias that let people find

177
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,960
the patterns that they're looking for

178
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,560
so we got a list here

179
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,319
you can read it

180
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,360
they all have the same sort of thing

181
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,199
night vision video artifacts audio

182
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
recorders

183
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,600
let's move on to the fmri the functional

184
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,680
f the functional mri it's a tool that

185
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
was developed in the 1990s and measures

186
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,039
blood oxygenation in the brain that's

187
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
all it does

188
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,360
blood oxygen oxygenation is somewhat

189
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,800
decent proxy for telling us what areas

190
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,800
of the brain are being more active but

191
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,039
that's about where the good parts end

192
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,280
it collects an image of between 130 and

193
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,199
160 000 voxels

194
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,520
with noise inherent in the capture it

195
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,039
has time-based blurring which means that

196
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,039
when a part of the brain demands more

197
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
oxygen it takes several seconds to ramp

198
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,960
up the detection on the mri when the

199
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,880
demand of blood goes down it keeps

200
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,400
showing up for a while as well

201
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,960
head movements can throw it off in

202
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
spatial resolution but the main problem

203
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,240
is that it's generating a large and

204
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,560
noisy data set with over a hundred

205
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,639
thousand potential correlations

206
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,560
p hacking is the term given to the idea

207
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,800
that if you try enough independent tests

208
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,639
you'll eventually find a positive answer

209
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,280
if your p-value threshold is five

210
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,199
percent and you try something 20 times

211
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,759
you'd be expected to find one false

212
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,759
positive

213
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,720
so

214
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,800
this is a fish in an fmri notably it's a

215
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,720
dead fish a salmon

216
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
craig bennett of uc santa barbara was

217
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,400
frustrated with the situation of fmri

218
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,880
studies being released that were not

219
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,479
doing multiple comparison corrections

220
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,319
which are mathematical techniques to

221
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,440
help negate the inherent p hacking that

222
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,199
fmri

223
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
correlations give

224
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,800
so i went to the store bought a dead

225
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
salmon put in the fmri and then asked

226
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,479
the dead salmon to explain what emotions

227
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,639
were being depicted in the pictures that

228
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,720
he showed to the dead salmon

229
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,560
the fmri did not fail to show the

230
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,919
response of the dead fish you can see

231
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,639
the voxels lighting up there

232
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,479
so the study making fun of the lack of

233
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,520
use fixed fmri right well

234
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,240
fast forward to 2016 anders eklund ran

235
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,759
some tests on large sets of control data

236
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,080
but the p-value of o5 5 false positives

237
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,479
were expected instead he found false

238
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,720
positive rates as high as 70 percent

239
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,319
it turns out the normal the noisy data

240
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,800
with opaque software still wasn't

241
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,440
working right

242
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,360
a staggering 40 000 fmri studies were

243
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,000
potentially used use the software that

244
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,360
he tested and could be made very easily

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
to show positive results when

246
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,919
non-existent this was on the heels of a

247
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,680
year prior when a separate study

248
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
failed to replicate 50 percent of the

249
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,120
published studies in psychology that

250
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
they examined

251
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,200
obviously i'm not accusing all the

252
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,360
scientists involved in malpractice

253
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
but the drive to find a positive result

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
is a strong one and what the science is

255
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,200
used for is not always benign

256
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,279
these sorts of studies are used and

257
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,519
abused to advance policy arguments even

258
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,440
in some cases directly in politics with

259
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,360
studies saying things like this

260
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,959
political group shows more activity in

261
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,560
their brain and this part of the brain

262
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,839
than that political group and things

263
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,760
like that

264
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,000
the sheen of science and hard data lends

265
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,720
credibility to these uses and that may

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,720
not always be deserved

267
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,320
so this is this year's tour badge cs and

268
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,240
i built it for the tour project it's a

269
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,640
mini polygraph with two channels

270
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,640
galvanic skin response and heart rate

271
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,839
someone on twitter said how can you sell

272
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,240
this without warning people that

273
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,480
polygraph is [ __ ] well

274
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,160
i'm here giving the stock so

275
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,160
you've been warned it's [ __ ]

276
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,680
so about the polygraph

277
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,560
here's some stuff you probably already

278
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,399
know it's rolled into missile in court

279
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,720
which is unlike the rorschach test which

280
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,959
is apparently still mostly admissible it

281
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,560
measures several body bodily parameters

282
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,880
that in theory are correlated with

283
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,720
stress the apa among other groups say

284
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,480
there's little evidence that polygraph

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,480
can accurately detect lies

286
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,360
the inventors of the polygraph are more

287
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,680
interesting than the machine itself

288
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,200
nard is on the left his name was leonard

289
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,160
keeler but he preferred being called

290
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,920
nard he was into stage magic on the

291
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,160
right is john larson he was the first

292
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,160
cop in the u.s ever to hold a phd which

293
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,480
he got in physiology

294
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,160
in 1921 these guys work together to

295
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
invent the polygraph it's a fitting

296
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,279
invention a stage musician and someone

297
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
with a phd in medical field both become

298
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,320
cops and invent the thing that's the

299
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,320
intersection of all those things

300
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,440
it is interesting to note that the

301
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,600
john larson there he's he said later on

302
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,320
that he regretted ever inventing the

303
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,480
polygraph that it was it was abused for

304
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,959
in ways that he never intended

305
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,480
originally

306
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,640
so here are the major categories of

307
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,800
testing the use of the polygraph the

308
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,399
relevant irrelevant control question

309
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,680
tests guilty knowledge so speak of

310
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,680
tension test

311
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,360
they all have some traits in common they

312
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,360
all mostly work because the subject

313
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,959
believes that they work

314
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,480
it's the main job of the examiner to

315
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,480
convince the subject that they work

316
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,480
all of the tests are biased against the

317
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,600
innocent we'll talk more about that

318
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,519
later

319
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,560
and for in the results for the most part

320
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,560
involve subjective judgment

321
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,680
the oldest and simplest test is probably

322
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,920
the conception the lay public has for

323
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
how polygraph works some irrelevant

324
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
questions are asked and they're known to

325
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,959
be irrelevant by the examiner and the

326
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,880
subject

327
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,560
then the relevant questions are asked

328
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,720
this version has the most subjective

329
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,720
interpretation of the results

330
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,320
it varied so much from examiner to

331
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
examiner that it was impossible to

332
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,399
compare anything

333
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,600
this version of the test is really

334
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,600
rarely used today

335
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,440
the control question test this is the

336
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
big one in the us and has been for a

337
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,760
long time this one works in a slightly

338
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
more nuanced way the pre-interview is

339
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
conducted where the examiner goes over

340
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,079
every question with the subject

341
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,440
the questions might be something like

342
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,519
what is your name

343
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,279
have you ever stolen anything

344
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,920
were you at home on the night of the

345
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,079
bank robbery

346
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,760
examiner will say

347
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,200
the what is your name question is the

348
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,880
control question but it's not the

349
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
control question it's an irrelevant

350
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,680
question the true control question is

351
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,519
have you ever stolen anything

352
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,600
you may confess to a few things like

353
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,000
stealing pens from work or candy bar

354
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,279
when you were a kid or whatever it

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,560
doesn't really matter how much you

356
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,160
confess

357
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,240
so then during the test they changed the

358
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,160
question slightly to other than what

359
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,240
you've already told me have you ever

360
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,000
stolen anything

361
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,399
the premise is that it's impossible to

362
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,480
fully confess to the question it's a

363
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,399
probable lie question one that forces

364
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,200
you into lying even if you don't intend

365
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,200
to

366
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,600
the probable lie questions establish the

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,120
baseline for what a lie looks like

368
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
for that person

369
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,440
on the graph

370
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,279
the problem with this is that the

371
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,600
cleaner your conscience is the more

372
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,240
likely you are to fail the test

373
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,320
i read an example where this was used

374
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,320
where this particular question was used

375
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,240
as the probable lie question

376
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,079
and here it is other than what you've

377
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,160
told me have you ever done any illegal

378
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,920
drugs even once

379
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,519
the subject failed the polygraph because

380
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,519
they were a super straight edge person

381
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,120
who could with great confidence answer

382
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,079
that that question

383
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,760
which set their live baseline really low

384
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,160
that's just one way the test is biased

385
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,160
against the innocent

386
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,480
the stem test mentioned here on the

387
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,560
slide is just more theater the examiner

388
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,120
instructs the subject to lie on a

389
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
question and that they tell the subject

390
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
that that's establishing the baseline

391
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,680
but it really isn't

392
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,120
we all know at this point that that's

393
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,000
going to be treated as an irrelevant

394
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,760
question

395
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,160
the probable i questions of the real

396
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,880
baseline the subject answers and then

397
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,639
the examiner says um yeah yeah look look

398
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,040
you can see here this this machine can

399
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,720
tell you're lying but it's all theater

400
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,000
to convince the subject that the machine

401
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,560
works

402
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,079
so that that's the stim test

403
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,760
so is there anything better is there a

404
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,839
better methodology

405
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,279
yeah but only slightly so

406
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,360
in japan they use a test called the

407
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,880
guilty knowledge test in this test often

408
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,120
the examiner isn't even aware of the

409
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,199
facts of the case on purpose

410
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,279
is much less involved in the process the

411
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,040
examiner may still use some theater to

412
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,480
convince the subject of the validity of

413
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,519
the test but

414
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,360
questions are all multiple choice

415
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,040
the subject is presented with the

416
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,360
question and answers

417
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
which includes the correct answer that's

418
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,120
a fact of the crime

419
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,399
that's unknown to the public and several

420
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,160
innocent several incorrect answers

421
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,920
the idea is that the subject will show a

422
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
greater response when the correct choice

423
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,360
is presented and that this response will

424
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,920
correlate over a large number of

425
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,920
questions

426
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,000
this test is still biased against the

427
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,000
innocent since the guilty can seek out

428
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,920
knowledge on how the test works and

429
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,680
ensure that their response is less to

430
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,519
the correct answer than it is to the

431
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,360
other answers

432
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,560
then the guilty know what the correct

433
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,560
answers are after all

434
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,040
related to the guilty knowledge test is

435
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,279
the peak of tension test this is often

436
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,600
used with sequential quantities such as

437
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,920
was the amount stolen one two three or

438
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,839
four thousand

439
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,680
the idea is that the tension builds up

440
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,440
as the correct as the correct answer is

441
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,320
approached and then we'll release once

442
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,560
it's surpassed so what goes up must come

443
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,560
down

444
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,519
so that's it for the polygraph

445
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,360
this is far from a complete discussion

446
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,560
on the topic in the short talk but it

447
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,240
should give you some idea of the

448
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,519
deception that underlies the machine

449
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,880
itself

450
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,399
on this slide i put some honorable

451
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,320
mentions

452
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,920
you may or may not recognize the machine

453
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,000
on the left it's a scientology e-meter

454
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,639
the glorified love tester that tells you

455
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
about your uh painful emotion engrams

456
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,759
and the invisible aliens that are

457
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,759
attached to you

458
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,839
and on the right is d.d palmer the

459
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,600
founder of chiropractic that's another

460
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,600
field where the technology is used to

461
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,199
give a sheen of credibility

462
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,199
to the underlying pseudoscience

463
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,839
so the next time you're using an

464
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,399
electronic tool question if you're being

465
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,440
deceived either by someone else or by

466
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,199
yourself

467
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,560
i'm giggs and you can probably find me

468
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,920

469
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,480
want to discuss

470
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,480
enjoy the rest of defcon

471
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
and i apologize for the

472
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,560
bug zapper
