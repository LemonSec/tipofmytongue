00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,200
hi everyone and welcome to my bio hack

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
panel i am very fortunate to have

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,320
two friends with me today ken carter and

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,960
eric dolphy and today we want to talk a

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,279
little bit about red versus blue versus

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,240
green the logical disconnect between the

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,039
different teams and large organizations

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,039
uh gentlemen please go ahead and say hi

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,439
to the crowd

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
i'll go first hey i'm eric i work at a

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,480
medical device manufacturing company

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,640
and i currently position in an

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,320
enterprise role helping oversee and

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,800
mentor teams build their applications

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,559
and get them out in the public app

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,959
stores

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,600
my name is ken carlo i'm a technologist

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,680
uh i split my time between boston and

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,360
washington dc

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,440
i like to do a lot of different things

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
around security i came from the finance

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
and healthcare background so i spent a

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,720
lot of time thinking about not just how

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
to keep data secure for individual

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,720
companies but for individuals themselves

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,720
well i thought we're going to talk a

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
little bit about the red versus blue

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,159
versus green

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,560
now from your experience how do you

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,040
think in a large organization's

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,600
these three teams tend to work together

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,759
do they do this well do they struggle

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,439
and what are some of the commonalities

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,559
you see in those struggles

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,759
well erica

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,960
i'm gonna let you take a swing that's

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,079
even on mine sure yeah so i

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,040
it really depends on the team my my

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,439
background i came from a business unit

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,680
that specialized in

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,600
devices that

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
one of the panelists here is very

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,640
familiar with

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,720
and

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,439
working with teams to build maintain

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,840
release these applications

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
across several different releases doing

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,479
things like penetration testing

50
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,320
taking that feedback in and making

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,479
mitigations or making corrections and

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,439
such

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
when when you get to large teams uh my

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,879
my experiences have been

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,280
mixed depending on the project where it

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
is in its life cycle is it a new product

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
or is it something that you know is

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,520
going through maintenance releases and

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
different kind of situations where

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
maybe there is a dedicated security

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
engineer

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,599
on the team ejected in the project from

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,959
day one

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,760
or maybe you have another project where

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
due to rollover or things like that you

66
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
know people leave the company

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,239
and and we have to onboard um the

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,239
security engineers into our new product

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,920
or our existing products so it can be

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
hit or miss and it's i've had

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,480
a number of different experiences but

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,120
a lot of really good ones uh we're we're

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
working hand in hand um in groups and

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,440
it's it's definitely been an evolution

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,400
for me as i've been at the company the

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
last seven years

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
um right out of college

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
where it's like you know i'm i'm trying

79
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,599
to just absorb and meet all these

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,840
security engineers regulatory engineers

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,519
privacy engineers

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,400
these seemingly different silos

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,319
at least for me my experiences have been

84
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,599
that um

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,200
i've i've been fortunate enough that

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,480
they've been broken down as in in some

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,360
fashion and i i get good visibility and

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
collaboration with the different teams

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,599
i think my experiences are pretty

90
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,959
similar to yours but at one point in my

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,879
career path i decided to really

92
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,720
specialize in things through how to

93
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,440
learn and do offensive cyber so that i

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
have a better idea of

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,799
how to secure it

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
and i discovered that

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
most companies really don't accept nor

98
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,440
invest into red teaming with a lot of

99
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
stuff like chaos engineering so

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,760
companies are perfectly happy being

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,120
situated with the notion that if a risk

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
occurs i have a mitigation effort

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,120
and when the risk does occur

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
i'm liable for this amount

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,640
so the

106
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
solve is never for

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,280
keeping something safe the solve is for

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
how much can i lose and expect to

109
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,519
survive so it's a very different world

110
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,720
for me on the red blue green team versus

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
risk management so from a pure security

112
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,759
side it's really fascinating where

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,080
i often find people who do invest in red

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,040
teaming to really understand criticality

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,639
and vulnerability in their business

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,600
model

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,720
versus those who don't

118
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,800
i think when it comes to vulnerabilities

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,520
here

120
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,919
one thing at least the person sometimes

121
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,600
tends to forget is the

122
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,280
person on the other side that has the

123
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
device the one that that

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
inevitably is at the end of it all

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,040
um what i have learned from my

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,199
perspective is that we often speak

127
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,199
different languages and we have

128
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,960
different perspectives and context

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,039
and it's only now recently that i've

130
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
learned thanks to eric a little bit

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
about the green team straight stresses

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,759
and pressures and context that i was

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
able to shift and i do believe that if

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,639
we understand the whole ecosystem or all

135
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,639
sides of it that we are able to actually

136
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
communicate effectively

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
now i have another question and this

138
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,280
might be a touchy subject in terms of

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
looking at the recent breaches in

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
healthcare

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,880
is there

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,039
one instance that you can say you know

143
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,240
this was handled well

144
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,759
that to say i can't think of an instance

145
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,720
where

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,440
a security side was handled well

147
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
but the

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,000
mitigation so the legal impact of the

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,240
business that's handled pretty well

150
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,479
right so you know at what point can we

151
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
get enough lawyers to

152
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
fight against the company going down

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
that part is happening really well from

154
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,560
a business aspect from a security aspect

155
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,199
i think the better question to ask is

156
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,199
why are we prioritizing different parts

157
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,199
of security over another when the

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,880
objective is to secure something and

159
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,479
that fundamental objective wasn't

160
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,960
accomplished

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
but i mean it's often said that you know

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
security gets a budget once the breach

163
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
has occurred but it's little it's often

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
little too late

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
um

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
in the whole instance of things eric do

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,400
you have anything to add to this um

168
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,919
yeah i don't i don't have any personal

169
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,960
experience um with any intrusions or

170
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,039
breaches

171
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,720
in in the industry as you know as a

172
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
consumer

173
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
being a affected you know your email and

174
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,080
password or whatever

175
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
for any number of things whether it be

176
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
personal applications health

177
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,199
applications fitness applications

178
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,599
anything that is you know private

179
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,280
information phi pii location information

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,759
it's it's a real drag to consumers

181
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,199
that

182
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,280
application developers

183
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
you know either they don't know or they

184
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,039
don't care or there's

185
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,360
other constraints like it you know maybe

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,639
time cost money etc where things just

187
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,240
don't get built the way that they should

188
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
be from the get-go

189
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,479
and one one thing that i i take pride in

190
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,400
my work is you know when i

191
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,960
get a penetration test result on an

192
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,160
application

193
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,639
i'm going to go read these and not only

194
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,880
like understand but plan to make actions

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,479
on them before an application were to be

196
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,599
released

197
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,039
or

198
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,759
if i obtain this information and provide

199
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,599
it to other teams to say hey this is

200
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,360
something that you know might be a

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
common mistake if you're a new team but

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,919
building out a new application and you

203
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,840
just don't know any better so let me

204
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,759
enable you to make the right decisions

205
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,400
to

206
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
have that long-term success so i i don't

207
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
have any experience with the breach more

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,199
of the you know preventing things

209
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
um so that they don't happen or you know

210
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
if if they do you know we've got

211
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,879
mitigations put in place that it's

212
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,120
things like if there's a denial of

213
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,360
service it's a single individual it's

214
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,479
not a systemic thing building uh privacy

215
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,319
by a design and security and design from

216
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,520
day one

217
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,080
if i may pull on that rather that's

218
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
really really beautiful i love that

219
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,039
pattern and to kind of pile on that for

220
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,120
me the way i think about screw today

221
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
even outside the healthcare just in

222
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,560
software in general is to be able to

223
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
bring that teaming to the beginning to

224
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,080
be able to have security as a

225
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,160
fundamental principle day one i prefer

226
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
to take my security folks instead of

227
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
having a separate team to embed them in

228
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,360
each software dev team so that because i

229
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
can never expect

230
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,000
or

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,958
even

232
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,880
anticipate any software personal

233
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,479
developer it's going to be a security

234
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,559
access i can't count on that so to hedge

235
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,159
that i'd rather have skateboards

236
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,160
inserted they want

237
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
yeah if i look back and reflect on a

238
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,760
requirement that i had reviewed in the

239
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,800
past

240
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,279
from a security engineering colleague

241
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
and it was you know very vague and

242
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
generic and in my background as a

243
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
software developer

244
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
i don't have a formal security training

245
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,360
background i don't have

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,680
that number of years experience dealing

247
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
with these things it's like like i have

248
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,560
to ask

249
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,399
well what do i do about this how how do

250
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,519
i do this

251
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,519
and whether it be you know reflect on

252
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,600
open source to find a library that does

253
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,279
what we're asking you to do

254
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,760
or you know leverage another team it's

255
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
it's really good to

256
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,519
be efficient at communicating and

257
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,760
collaborating with the individuals that

258
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,920
know and not having everybody

259
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,360
responsible to know everything

260
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,680
so i'm kind of like crusading at the

261
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,480
moment to try and teach developers

262
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
security and forensics

263
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
so building in the information that we

264
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,080
need to detect prevent and investigate a

265
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
breach

266
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
and that is only done because i mean

267
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,519
let's face it we are good at defense and

268
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
you know attack but we're not the ones

269
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,040
building the software

270
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,200
uh we're not the ones influencing the

271
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
code or what is getting written that

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
that's in the hands of green

273
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
so i think i almost see blue as

274
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
red basically strengthening the code

275
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
that's produced by influencing the

276
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
knowledge that's passed on how do you

277
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,279
guys feel about that

278
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,920
i think that's a really accurate read on

279
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
being able to divide and conquer the

280
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,240
team but to have the one cohesive team

281
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,519
to be able to move forward with the

282
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,000
entire stack going forward versus having

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
separate responsibility i'd rather not

284
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
have this waterfall event of thinking

285
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,160
security after the fact i rather think

286
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
about it way ahead her though

287
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
yes so you i agree completely there with

288
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,360
you that we should i sometimes feel we

289
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,079
do a thing that i call dev opsec where

290
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,920
security is always lost in the line

291
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
where we should be doing

292
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,360
devsecops all together as one team as

293
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,920
one collective

294
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,600
i often feel like we're trying to fix

295
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
things at the end of the pipeline where

296
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
it's super expensive for an organization

297
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
for a development team to handle it

298
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,399
but we don't address the things right at

299
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,519
the beginning

300
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,000
now i have another question for you guys

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,959
um taking into account

302
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,130
the context of um

303
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,399
[Music]

304
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,640
medical devices that have been involved

305
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
where do you see the future of this

306
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,959
going in terms of dealing with legacy

307
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,279
devices that at some point become

308
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,399
vulnerable

309
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,640
do you guys think that will be a problem

310
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,519
or do you guys think that it's not going

311
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
to be a problem because we're solving

312
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,040
them and updating them at the moment

313
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,839
so

314
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,079
to step into the light of

315
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,800
new devices coming online at

316
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
my workplace or in competitors or in

317
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,480
just in the medical industry in general

318
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,079
bluetooth being a really popular

319
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,839
technology because it's on everybody's

320
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,079
smartphone everybody's got an app for

321
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,360
their product

322
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,200
these devices are going to remain

323
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,120
connected to the smartphone as long as

324
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,839
the smartphone is in the embodiment that

325
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,839
it is but to your point about the legacy

326
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,040
devices

327
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
um these these devices are going to

328
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
eventually be phased out you know they

329
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
have a certain life expense expectancy

330
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,440
for for batteries and support and things

331
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,880
like that

332
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
but but there's always a risk of you

333
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,279
know every every device it just takes

334
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,720
time and money

335
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,959
before you can find something and we can

336
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,680
only do our best to to make sure that

337
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,839
the legacy devices get just as much care

338
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,120
as the new products do as we go forward

339
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,600
i think it's also a really complicated

340
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
balance between the consumer and what

341
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
devices can be easily changed at what

342
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,920
can

343
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,440
vice the

344
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
support of the limited devices even

345
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,560
google has now made a statement of how

346
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,399
they're going to discontinue

347
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,480
connectivity to older android versions

348
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
because of circuit risk and i imagine

349
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,279
that while bluetooth client insulin

350
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,639
pumps could be changed out because

351
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
they're external a bluetooth connected

352
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,760
uh pacemaker or even the heart control

353
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,440
device i think may be a very very

354
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,639
different problem

355
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
so i think there's gonna have to be a

356
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,480
balanced somewhere

357
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
of how to prioritize what you are going

358
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,880
to support legacy wise i think that

359
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,800
might be the best thing i could think of

360
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,079
to try to

361
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,279
help humans live longer

362
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,959
like one of the things that i learned

363
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,279
very early on in my research was that

364
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,800
yeah these things are connected to

365
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,519
patients i mean i've never done since 19

366
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,519
but you know sometimes it's a question

367
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,160
to patch or not to patch um

368
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,880
these cardiac devices end up in surgery

369
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,720
for a patient that wants it to be

370
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
removed due to security constraints i

371
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,480
think it's very important how this

372
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
message gets communicated to those

373
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
patients affected a lot of them are

374
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,519
elderly or a lot or not technologically

375
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,079
savvy but now do you guys feel that the

376
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,600
medical you know their health care

377
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
professionals have actually caught up

378
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,320
with medical technology and are able to

379
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
explain cyber risks and advisories to

380
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,920
patients

381
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
um how do you think

382
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,959
that could be combated if it's not done

383
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,959
as we expect which should be done

384
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,680
i feel that that's a matter of what that

385
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,279
person's priority is i think that a

386
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,639
medical professional priority is going

387
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,399
to be explained the health benefits and

388
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,600
risk

389
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
and

390
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,079
i think there's gonna have to be ways to

391
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,440
quantify

392
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
cyber risk is part of health risk for an

393
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,600
md to really care about and be

394
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,680
passionate about explaining it and also

395
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,240
have the bandwidth to even try to get to

396
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,760
the adaptive why it's critical

397
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,040
so for me

398
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,440
when when we're thinking about

399
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,839
education to our patients within our

400
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,160
systems within our applications

401
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,199
um

402
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,800
there's a couple of different

403
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
personas that kind of emerge individuals

404
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,760
that just simply don't care you know

405
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
they put everything on facebook they put

406
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,279
everything on the internet they use the

407
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,519
same password for every single thing

408
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,279
because that you know maybe that's how

409
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,959
they remember it or they just

410
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,560
don't know any better or don't care and

411
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,399
then there's individuals that

412
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,279
you know only like like myself i only

413
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,720
buy apple products

414
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
i have the mindset that

415
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,320
my data is better protected in this

416
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,600
ecosystem compared to the alternative uh

417
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,279
but i i make this

418
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
conscious choice about it and you use

419
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,680
password managers use the

420
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,839
secure private email all these kind of

421
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,120
things that

422
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
um as as we see more and more devices

423
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,199
being introduced the market that are not

424
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
just for the elderly because you know

425
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
there's there's new

426
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
diagnoses there's new technologies that

427
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
you know innovation every day uh we're

428
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,880
going to start to have more and more

429
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,680
users that have more of the

430
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,240
the mindset of i'd like to know what can

431
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,199
i do

432
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,680
and for that we can certainly provide

433
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
education whether it be materials that

434
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,120
is directly

435
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,199
to a user within the application like

436
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,120
when you're setting up your email and

437
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
password just mentioning you know it's

438
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,079
got to be this number case sensitivity

439
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,880
length strength etc and please remember

440
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
it please don't make it the same as

441
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,759
everything else or when we're educating

442
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,079
clinicians and field wraps about how the

443
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
technology works to kind of make sure

444
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,519
that there's no concern and the patients

445
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,680
really get that peace of mind because

446
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,519
they are trusting us

447
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,720
to

448
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,519
keep them going or or to help them in

449
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,600
any any way that we can through the

450
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,920
device or therapy that we're delivering

451
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
so there a lot of that education comes

452
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,199
in where

453
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,279
you're you're teaching and providing

454
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,279
that information is a really good way to

455
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,000
achieve that

456
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
so i i i have some questions

457
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,399
specifically aimed at the two of you um

458
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,240
because i think the perspective that you

459
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,320
come from is defensive can

460
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,560
what motivates someone to look into

461
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,959
hacking medical devices now i get asked

462
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,560
this question a lot and people look at

463
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,160
me strangely like this should be

464
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
something wrong with me right what is

465
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
your motivation behind you know doing

466
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,800
penetration tests on medical devices

467
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,360
and so you know breaking into them

468
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,599
sure my personal motivation is to uh

469
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,119
help a lot of my friends wear these

470
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,760
devices right like since i am of a

471
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,919
security-minded person i rather kind of

472
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,599
give the shot to c or the

473
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,520
vulnerabilities i can expose

474
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,199
and there are and the second half of

475
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,679
that is that responsible disclosure how

476
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,199
can i communicate with these companies

477
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,839
to effectively disseminate information

478
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,000
in a secure way so i don't actually risk

479
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,480
human life so my personal motivation is

480
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,520
to help friends help human life

481
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,520
so no plans of all domination yet

482
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,280
now eric say same question just slightly

483
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
different frame for you

484
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,360
how does one become a

485
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
software developer or engineer for

486
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
designing medical devices and what is it

487
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
like knowing that you are designing

488
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,160
something that has a physical impact on

489
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,120
someone's longevity

490
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,480
so a couple of my personal experiences

491
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,600
for me

492
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,760
you know fresh out of college having a

493
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,880
computer

494
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,160
engineering degree working with

495
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,960
microchips and

496
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,440
regular computer code and

497
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,360
whatever may be in college getting

498
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,000
getting a job lined up out of school as

499
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,080
an associate very entry level

500
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
but very quickly becoming attached

501
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,000
because i have

502
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,240
family members extended that

503
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
have our devices and then you know

504
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,760
friends and colleagues that do it as

505
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,520
well and so there's there's a personal

506
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,120
connection that

507
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,640
is a drive and has been a drive for me

508
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,080
to accelerate and achieve in this space

509
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
but generally speaking you know

510
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
you you can do things like learning

511
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,720
about security learning about building

512
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
reliable applications learning about how

513
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,039
to build something that's private by

514
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,080
design

515
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,000
and not you know collecting data

516
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,880
unnecessarily just to be able to make a

517
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
profit that's not at all what we're in

518
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,559
the market for

519
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,000
because we're in the life-saving

520
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
business not in the data selling

521
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,960
business

522
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,520
so it really it really depends on

523
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,240
where you're looking to get into things

524
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,400
if you want to be more developing the

525
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
product i can speak to mobile

526
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,120
applications you know i'll just dive in

527
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,120
a ton of resources online to get into

528
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,799
mobile technologies

529
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
can't really speak too much about the

530
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,200
embedded firmware devices

531
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,039
or the implantable devices in terms of

532
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,440
how to get into that game or that space

533
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
but it is certainly

534
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,080
a different way of thinking uh even from

535
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,919
a mobile's perspective

536
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,400
like if i compare some individuals that

537
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
work on server technologies you know the

538
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
server will scale we host things in the

539
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,679
cloud every company does it um you know

540
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,120
you just put more money in the server

541
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,280
will scale you got more resources you

542
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,760
work in a mobile space well

543
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,679
you know your application is limited to

544
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,360
what apple and what google want to give

545
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,760
you you go over that budget you know

546
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,720
they're going to terminate your

547
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,480
application and then the user has to

548
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
relaunch it to resume whatever they were

549
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,559
doing and then the embedded devices you

550
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,440
know being very very particular about

551
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,000
every single bite of memory management

552
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,240
so there is different levels of

553
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,080
scrutiny and different areas and

554
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,000
different constraints depending on which

555
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
part of a system you're building

556
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
that are all

557
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,240
very very interesting and equally

558
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,039
different in their own way

559
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,280
i think what is very obvious is that the

560
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,840
motivation behind this is

561
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
into making it safer more securely and

562
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,840
better built

563
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,440
even though we come from very different

564
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,720
backgrounds for me it's more about

565
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
how do we detect

566
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
and investigate that something's

567
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
actually happened on a device do we have

568
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,720
the capabilities to forensically look at

569
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,640
these devices and even know that they've

570
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,000
been a target of a cyber attack

571
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,799
that's kind of where i my passion lies

572
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,720
and the reason being is we don't know

573
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,559
that there hasn't been a cyber attack

574
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,400
because we simply don't have the

575
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,799
information to do so

576
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,360
but again also i have a device so i

577
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,520
wanted to know that

578
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,679
my heart is safe in the hands of the

579
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,280
people that bolted

580
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,039
and i actually got to meet the developer

581
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,880
behind the firmware on my device and it

582
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,600
was a very emotional meeting because

583
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
you're looking at the person's

584
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,320
mind that's sculpted the thing that

585
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,880
every day saves your life

586
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,559
now looking at what we can do better

587
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,360
going forward can you you talk to big

588
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
organizations that medical manufacturers

589
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,280
are big

590
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,159
how do they successfully navigate

591
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,360
building secure software and and

592
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,000
navigate this torrential

593
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
road to

594
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,760
success

595
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,440
that is a enormous question and one i

596
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,840
think about all the time

597
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,000
to a point where i am actually starting

598
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,240
to write something about it so there's a

599
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,919
lot of processes out there today right

600
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,880
there is iso at 31 000

601
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,360
uh there is the traditional risk formula

602
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,600
right like is it you know what's

603
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
likely versus what's the

604
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,080
level of consequence probably both is

605
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,919
the is predicated upon the quality of

606
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,120
data inputted and still gets the best

607
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,360
it also it largely ignores the treatment

608
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,520
process so i've been thinking about my

609
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,000
experience writing software and how i

610
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,919
produce software and how i put my

611
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,159
security embedded and i've been coming

612
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,039
up with a concept called the risk budget

613
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,840
and the risk budget is really the is the

614
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,480
how do i talk to people equally on both

615
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,120
sides how do i have my security team be

616
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,799
able to express security problems to

617
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,480
your concerns and how do i have

618
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,919
non-practitioners the rest of the

619
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,000
organization who are not having a

620
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,919
security to be able to come to the table

621
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,159
and still have a conversation so that's

622
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,640
something i'm reframing recently and

623
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,600
kind of

624
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,520
run writing out the process that's been

625
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,039
successful for me

626
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,039
but at the end of the day what a risk

627
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,880
budget is this you want to subtract

628
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,600
the

629
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,840
logistical problems from actual security

630
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,000
problems and do the actual security

631
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,080
around what's important critical because

632
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,679
you can't secure all the things all the

633
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,320
time and you sure cannot secure

634
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,000
everything all at once for

635
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,799
prioritization criticality and a plan to

636
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,039
go forward

637
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,720
so in in my role there's a couple of

638
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,280
different things that i can do i'm doing

639
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,799
planning on doing

640
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,039
things like you know if you look at

641
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,559
certificate pinning to prevent man in

642
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
the middle attacks on on your network

643
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,960
stack this is something that you know

644
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
you're not going to go and read about if

645
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,600
you're checking out apple developer

646
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
android google developer websites

647
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,640
they're just going to show you how to

648
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,320
make the network call they're not going

649
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,400
to tell you why you need to do this

650
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,919
you're only going to know why if your

651
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,000
security engineer your your colleague

652
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,679
that's done it before and

653
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,320
for either reaction or preventative

654
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,240
measures has told you you need to do it

655
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,480
then you go do it things like that where

656
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,559
it's it's simple enough and it's

657
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,440
it

658
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,640
takes a lot of risk out of play just do

659
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,279
it

660
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,840
make a standard uh build in tools that

661
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
you can inspect you know hire pen

662
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,120
testers

663
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
do internal testing make sure that your

664
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
environments are set up to you know

665
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,799
manipulate in such a way that you can

666
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,480
prove that your application is doing

667
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
what it's supposed to be doing other

668
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,919
strategies you can put into your

669
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,600
applications for other security

670
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,679
mechanisms like preventing denial of

671
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,559
service on on your implantable device or

672
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,159
maybe denial of service on the

673
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,600
application that connects to that

674
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,400
implantable device these are more ideas

675
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,159
that you can rinse and repeat across

676
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,080
projects but not necessarily have the

677
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,880
same implementation because as you know

678
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
like as an example a

679
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,679
cardiovascular implantable device is far

680
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,640
different than a diabetes pump in terms

681
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
of what it does you know one delivering

682
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,480
electrical therapy another one

683
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,600
potentially

684
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,120
delivering insulin or or other

685
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,520
devices just in general maybe they don't

686
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,840
do any kind of delivery of therapy and

687
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,760
they're just reading data

688
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,640
so

689
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,360
between creating reusable components and

690
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,159
tools that you can put into place and

691
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,039
enforce advise encourage teams to

692
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,080
implement

693
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,440
and then building more of a here's a

694
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,600
documentation strategy on setting

695
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,919
yourself up for long-term success making

696
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,960
sure that you're checking the right

697
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,480
boxes and doing your due diligence

698
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,120
and then be maybe uh to call you out on

699
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,480
a couple of things

700
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,159
the conversations that

701
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,240
you know that we've been working on

702
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,919
um we're

703
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,279
talking about developing logging

704
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,559
as a first party

705
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,720
feature of an application for any number

706
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
of reasons whether it be the developer

707
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,320
the forensics engineer friend that

708
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,440
you've got

709
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,880
or it's the field tech support who

710
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,120
whoever whoever it may be

711
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,320
building robust logging solutions to

712
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,279
enable you to analyze items during

713
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,480
development

714
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,559
during your initial release and all the

715
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,520
way through

716
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
your production

717
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,000
and through legacy and retirement to the

718
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,799
device monitoring things at all points

719
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,159
in the life cycle of that product

720
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,720
so i i kind of thanks for calling me out

721
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,400
like you know i'm the one that's hitting

722
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,240
the panel i'm not supposed to be called

723
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,120
out well played um i think what i

724
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,000
realized is we all do instant response

725
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,760
all of us red blue and green and i you

726
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,360
know how i came to the conclusion is

727
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,520
like eric was explaining to me that they

728
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,279
do in field investigations when they

729
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,720
have to debug something i don't think

730
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
but that's type of incident your

731
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,159
incident is that your device or your

732
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,080
application start functioning

733
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
and then as i thought from when i've

734
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
done some you know paint testing and

735
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
reverse engineering well that was an

736
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,600
incident as well i was investigating how

737
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
to break into something and then you

738
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,279
have me on the forensic and incident

739
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,960
response side that looks at a security

740
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,320
breach

741
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,279
so we all end up looking at the logs

742
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,520
but often the logs are designed by

743
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,679
developers board developers not

744
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,679
necessarily taking into account what we

745
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,520
need for security

746
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
or what we need for

747
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,919
uh investigation and sometimes even

748
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,279
leaving trails for red team to find

749
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,480
i don't know if you guys know the

750
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,799
statistics on insensitive information

751
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,360
disclosure and data breaches recently

752
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,760
it's said to be 80 sensitive data is

753
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,039
disclosed

754
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,960
during a data breach and a lot of that

755
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,559
information comes from the logs

756
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,799
why do you guys think that there's so

757
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,960
much sensitive data being leaked into an

758
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,520
application log

759
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,919
so one one thing might be

760
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,360
the

761
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,000
understanding of trust between systems

762
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,960
like you know if if i am putting a log

763
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,360
on my app and i i send that log to my

764
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
server you know i

765
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,440
in in theory it's encrypted

766
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,080
during rest and it's encrypted during in

767
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
in transit

768
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,399
um and if if i'm naive and don't know

769
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,520
any better

770
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,320
and just assume trusting everything then

771
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,640
you know i'll go about my business but

772
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,880
uh if if you've had conversations at

773
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,760
length

774
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,960
um with another member of another color

775
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,279
team you might realize that you know

776
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,240
it's it's intended to be placed in this

777
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,039
data warehouse or secure storage but you

778
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,760
know somebody might by accident

779
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,440
find some information come across some

780
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,039
information

781
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,080
or you know if you're analyzing

782
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,880
a

783
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,679
bug

784
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,600
in a mobile app and you look at the logs

785
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,679
and there's information that a developer

786
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,880
put in there

787
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,720
not knowing or not considering that it

788
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,840
was

789
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,799
example phi or pii one of the corrective

790
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,120
actions you can do is in your logging

791
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,640
requirements

792
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,840
design it such that you are not putting

793
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
that information in there maybe you're

794
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,480
hashing identifiers or you're

795
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,200
obfuscating these pieces of information

796
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,919
that is a one-way hash algorithm so if

797
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,159
you if you hold that information

798
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,159
in another context

799
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,840
you can run it through the same one-way

800
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,600
hash and then you can resolve the same

801
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,360
number and then you can verify that your

802
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,640
logs are

803
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
emitting the pieces of information

804
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,919
connecting to the things that they're

805
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,919
supposed to be doing so there's a lot of

806
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,720
work that can happen just by

807
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,200
making a developer think in a different

808
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,399
mindset about what to log how to log it

809
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,640
why to log it who's going to have access

810
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,679
to it

811
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,799
and

812
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,918
how long is it going to live

813
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,919
very well thought out the other the

814
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,360
other thing is the on the whole

815
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
transport of logs

816
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,960
the thing that i would worry about i

817
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,520
guess from the wrestling side is that i

818
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,000
tend to use opportunities like where

819
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,399
lots go or how logs are transmitted it's

820
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,360
either ways to expo data or even as an

821
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,720
attack service

822
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,320
so if that

823
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,480
making the transformation logs used and

824
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,720
just for me it's a way to get in

825
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
so i think there's also gonna be some

826
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,279
kind of a meaningful way to talk to both

827
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,440
the set team the logging team and the

828
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,600
dev team about how to be transformed

829
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,520
logs in a secure way and how do we

830
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,679
ensure that it's a one-way ingress

831
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,399
you know this is the kind of thing that

832
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,480
i like hearing because this is the thing

833
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
that people don't often know but the

834
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,960
logs are all often the key that opens

835
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,159
the door

836
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,520
to the red team

837
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,480
now

838
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
based upon me talking a little bit last

839
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,760
question that i have i'm going to ask

840
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,159
you guys to zero trust or not to zero

841
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,039
trust

842
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,919
i think that's a hard question for me to

843
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,679
consider when there are so many

844
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,679
in your and i guess in the this case

845
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,320
edge devices kind of moving around

846
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
and

847
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,000
i don't feel it's the device itself they

848
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,520
even have them locked down it's the

849
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,159
communication between device and the

850
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,519
whatever the

851
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,519
data devices so i guess in most

852
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,720
instances there will be a bluetooth

853
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,360
connection so what can we do to optimize

854
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,519
security around bluetooth we're making

855
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,080
this assumption and accept from the

856
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
console matching bluetooth that is about

857
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,360
the screen built in

858
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,039
but simultaneously there's a bunch of

859
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,399
problems around the authentication

860
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,240
scheme around as well

861
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,760
so for me

862
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,679
i don't think it's so much as a question

863
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,360
around to zero for the nozzle trust

864
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,880
because of the fundamental connections

865
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
the bluetooth connectivity between

866
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,279
is the biggest attack surface then i

867
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,640
would worry about securing that burst

868
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,320
so i might have a little bit of an

869
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,200
interesting um thought process on this

870
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,039
being in the mobile space

871
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,440
i don't only just think about you know

872
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,480
is is the iphone platform as a whole

873
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,840
secure or is google

874
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,880
secure

875
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,960
but i also think about

876
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,880
is that third-party library that saves

877
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,720
me a little bit of time

878
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,640
should i be using that

879
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,480
uh should i just learn what it's doing

880
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,080
and write it myself and control it

881
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
myself

882
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,279
or should i research you know an

883
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,880
algorithm

884
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,720
that does whatever it needs to do should

885
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,880
i research it and write it by hand what

886
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,559
what is the trade-off to accept some

887
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,440
library do you just trust it blindly or

888
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,840
do you do you use it with

889
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,240
caution and i i always tend to

890
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,200
write things by hand if if i can

891
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,799
write something that we control

892
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,799
internally and share it across the teams

893
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,279
and have revisions on it you know open

894
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,760
source is a wonderful place

895
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,600
you you see open source

896
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,159
and you then have that source too in

897
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,399
public visibility which you might get

898
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,399
some benefits of hey people reporting

899
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,120
bugs and then you can go inherit and fix

900
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,440
those things through the the updates

901
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,760
that are made to the repositories but uh

902
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,480
my my natural tendency is to not trust

903
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,440
anything

904
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,960
um and to build mitigations

905
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,679
many times over as often as we can

906
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,760
to make sure that you know doing a risk

907
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,760
analysis well what if what if the the

908
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,000
flash memory is compromised well then

909
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,760
you encrypt your data to make sure that

910
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,519
it's not encrypted well what if what if

911
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,360
they can get the keys well then the key

912
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,200
is different place than where the data

913
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,440
is so you know building in several

914
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,039
layers and walls

915
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,799
around it

916
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,480
at some point you're going to have to

917
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,360
trust

918
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,760
something

919
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,919
but when you have mitigations put in

920
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,840
place you're burning down that risk as

921
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,279
much as you can

922
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,360
i love that uh that's something i worry

923
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,279
about constantly that's the software

924
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,039
supply chain right

925
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,640
and uh

926
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,080
for me i

927
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,000
tend to go towards the open source rat

928
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
more and more and trust certain

929
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,000
libraries but check and verify for

930
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,799
myself before blind using so i tend to

931
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,480
corral how

932
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
my developers can get to certain

933
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,760
libraries pull down like i tend to

934
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,240
control my dev network so that folks

935
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,919
can't just go windowing out and grab

936
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,080
what they want there's a verification

937
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,320
process of what is trusted and how we

938
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,799
can maintain it i try not to fork

939
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,039
existing resource projects because for

940
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,360
me it's hard to maintain things so

941
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,760
there's now a separate domain knowledge

942
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
necessary to be in a certain team which

943
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,639
i try personally to avoid granted i am

944
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,399
not creating that device like yourself

945
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,440
so i don't have that high lit mr cross

946
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,199
but for me i also think about

947
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,839
sustainability

948
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,760
so there's there's definitely a

949
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,119
need sometimes to use a well-established

950
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,520
library that specializes in one thing

951
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,040
you know they are the experts in this

952
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,079
case not

953
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,159
not me as an individual developer like

954
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,599
me as a team

955
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,079
with my colleagues so there there is

956
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,159
trade-offs and and

957
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,280
making sure that updates are made timely

958
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,520
uh to the field where vulnerabilities if

959
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,599
they're identified they get patched or

960
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
you know new features or whatever it is

961
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,079
that's benefit benefiting the patient

962
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:50,960
um

963
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,719
that there that all comes into play when

964
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,918
making those kind of decisions

965
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,320
so to end our time off i would like to

966
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,240
end it off on a positive note what is

967
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,160
the one piece of advice you can give to

968
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,800
manufacturers

969
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,200
engineers or someone generally in this

970
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,320
space

971
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,359
um or what is the one thing you want to

972
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,720
highlight that they've done well you

973
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,480
know something positive to end it with

974
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,000
because the world's in turn more school

975
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,880
with over two years on um so let's end

976
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,599
it off with a positive note can you

977
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,800
europe first

978
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
thanks well first of all let's say

979
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,480
thanks to inviting here has been great

980
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,640
uh hearing folks like yourself and eric

981
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,560
talk just made it warm and fuzzy that

982
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,160
things have obviously done very very

983
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,680
well in mechatronics

984
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,720
uh so kudos to metronic in your teams

985
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,200
as for advice uh

986
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,720
stay curious

987
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,960
uh it's how i survived and secure the

988
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,160
game this long for me to always wonder

989
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,520
not always be

990
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,880
scared

991
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,040
you know security is a weird frontier to

992
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,520
be in and at times that can't be scary

993
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,280
but fear should not be

994
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,440
the motivator or the demotivator it

995
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,160
should be the end goal of how can we all

996
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,280
get to the same applicable share of data

997
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,000
and everything else

998
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,599
yeah i'm i'm really excited for the

999
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,760
future i i think you hit one of the big

1000
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,000
things that i had in mind about being

1001
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,359
curious

1002
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,000
as as a mobile developer that likes to

1003
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
partake in the annual developer

1004
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,760
conferences each summer

1005
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
eagerly anticipating the fall release

1006
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,000
and all the new things you always have

1007
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
to be on top of things to

1008
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,400
learn the new technologies

1009
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,839
like let's say you're not building

1010
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,200
application support for the fall updates

1011
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,000
at a compile time perspective but your

1012

from the big apple and and google

1016
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,640
campaigns that they see all over the

1017
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,119
internet and on tv so my one of the

circumstances by providing new

1026

1045
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,760

1046
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,359
testers because they understand how the

1047
