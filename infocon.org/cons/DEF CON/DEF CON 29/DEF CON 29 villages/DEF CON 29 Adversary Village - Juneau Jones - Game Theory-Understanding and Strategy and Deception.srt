00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,480
hello today i'm here to talk about

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,799
understanding strategy and deception

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,880
using game theory

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,639
a little bit about me my name is juno i

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,519
work as a red team consultant and also

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,080
do security research i moved to texas in

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,440
2018 from alaska and since then have

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,560
become really involved with the local

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,199
hacker community i currently run dc214

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,480
dallas's defcon group and i've been very

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,840
involved in the dallas hackers

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,400
association which is where i actually

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,560
got my start speaking about game theory

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,239
outside of the hacker community i also

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,920
volunteer and teach through girls who

16
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,079
code black girls code and at some other

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,079
local schools i've got my bachelor's

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,079
degree in computer science and economics

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,800
and i'm getting my master's degree in

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,160
cyber security from nyu and my contact

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
information is up on the screen if you

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
have any questions or comments or just

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
want to know more

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,960
just a little bit of a road map first

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,640
we're going to start by talking about

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
what is game theory and how has it been

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,000
used previously

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,440
and from there we're going to look at

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,199
the prisoner's dilemma which is one of

30
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,559
the most popular game theory examples

31
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,559
we're going to look at how to find a

32
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,400
simple equilibria and then look at a

33
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,920
repeated game where

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,080
the play where the players repeat the

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,680
same interaction more than once

36
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,760
next we'll look at brinksmanship how

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,760
drastic action can force your opponent's

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,759
strategy to change

39
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,759
and a signaling game where players have

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,759
the opportunity to trade information

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,920
that may or may not be true

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,600
using a very simple attack defense

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,240
scenario and we'll look at finding an

44
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
equilibria there as well and there are a

45
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,920
couple of definitions to keep in mind

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,520
the first of which game is the term i'm

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,520
going to use to refer to the interaction

48
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,280
that we're modeling and players is the

49
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,159
term we'll use for the ones doing the

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,640
interaction whether or not they're human

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,320
and rationality is defined by economists

52
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,600
is a little bit different it's defined

53
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,280
as doing what is best for oneself 100 of

54
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,119
the time now

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,439
that's quite a different definition than

56
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,600
i'd say most of us have but in this

57
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,240
scenario but we need this

58
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,960
in order to prove why or we need this as

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,960
a as a rule in order to explain why

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,079
players choose the highest payoffs in

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,600
our models moving forward

62
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,200
so we're actually going to start with

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,200
one of the most common game theory

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,879
examples the prisoner's dilemma

65
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,640
you're probably familiar with it it's

66
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,800
pretty popular either in the pilot

67
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,920
episode of half a dozen cop shows or

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,319
intro to psych in philosophy textbooks

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,760
but if you're not familiar it's

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,920
really where two individuals are

71
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,840
arrested after committing a crime

72
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,120
they're separated and offered the same

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,720
plea deal

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
uh the

75
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,160
that gives them two choices the first

76
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
choice we'll call defect

77
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,200
confess and you will go free only your

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,080
partner will be charged or cooperate

79
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,319
stay silent don't say anything

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
however if both players choose to defect

81
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,040
both will be charged if both cooperate

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
without communicating both will get a

83
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,879
lighter sentence

84
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,519
now obviously that's the best option but

85
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,440
is that what really happens

86
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,599
so here i have a payoff matrix for our

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
two prisoners alice and bob

88
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,519
and alice and bob

89
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,440
both have the option to cooperate or

90
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,519
defect

91
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,440
the the numerical values i have assigned

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,400
is the payoff just represent the amount

93
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,879
of good to each individual player

94
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,720
for example if alice chooses to defect

95
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,720
while bob chooses to cooperate she gets

96
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,040
that highest payoff of two the best

97
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
possible outcome for alice getting off

98
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,239
free

99
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
while bob gets that payoff of negative 1

100
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,680
the worst possible outcome for him which

101
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,239
is

102
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
getting the maximum sentence

103
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,200
now

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,239
because alice and bob are separated

105
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,400
they're essentially making their

106
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,480
decisions independent of each other this

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,799
is a simultaneous game

108
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,239
so all each player has to go off of is

109
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,760
what they believe their opponent will

110
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
choose to do

111
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
so

112
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,400
if alice believes that bob will choose

113
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,080
to cooperate she'll choose to defect for

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,920
that higher payoff

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,840
similarly if she believes bob will

116
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,239
choose to defect she'll choose to defect

117
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,920
as well again for the higher payoff

118
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,799
and because bob's in the exact same

119
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,480
situation and has the exact same payoff

120
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
he'll make the same choices choosing to

121
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
defect if he believes alice is going to

122
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,840
choose to cooperate

123
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,319
or choosing and choosing to defect if he

124
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,239
believes she'll choose to defect

125
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,319
this leaves us with a logical outcome of

126
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,400
the game or the nash equilibrium where

127
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
both players defect

128
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,799
now obviously this isn't the best

129
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,799
outcome of the game for either player

130
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,560
if both players choose to cooperate we

131
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,639
have what's called a pareto optimal

132
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,880
outcome an outcome that's better for

133
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,880
both players

134
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,320
however in real life this doesn't just

135
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,759
happen in a vacuum nothing in my

136
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,360
previous model addressed any of the

137
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
potential consequences of these

138
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,479
decisions outside of the direct

139
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,320
interaction

140
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,639
so we can start to make the model more

141
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,400
realistic by looking at a repeating game

142
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,199
where alice and bob end up in the same

143
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,040
situation over and over and end up

144
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
having to choose whether to cooperate or

145
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
defect each and every time again and

146
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,479
again

147
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,479
and when the same interaction happens

148
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,639
repeatedly players can begin to use a

149
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,400
punishment strategy to motivate each

150
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,160
other to make the choices

151
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,759
that they would want

152
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
and there are many types of punishment

153
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
strategy but we're going to look at the

154
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,039
great what's called the grim trigger

155
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,160
punishment strategy cooperate until the

156
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,639
trade and then choose to defect forever

157
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,960
after that now obviously this leaves the

158
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,400
player open to betrayal at the beginning

159
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,039
but there's

160
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,479
retribution if the player is betrayed

161
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,680
one thing we have to keep in mind when

162
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,680
we're looking at the math for this

163
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
though is the discount factor which is a

164
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
measure of patience

165
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,440
essentially future payoff is worth less

166
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,960
than present payoff

167
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,960
ten dollars now is worth

168
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,560
ten dollars ten dollars

169
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,639
two days in the future is worth ten

170
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,000
times d a number from zero to one that

171
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,520
represents the decrease in payoff

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,479
so

173
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,919
if you're in if you're in a scenario

174
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,400
and you believe that your opponent is

175
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,800
using a grim trigger punishment strategy

176
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,880
you know that as long as your

177
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
you haven't defected your opponent will

178
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,039
cooperate with you

179
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,800
so we can find the payoff to cooperate

180
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,560
is going to be equal to 1 minus the

181
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,880
discount factor

182
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,639
multiplied by one the best possible

183
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,680
payoff you can get in the scenario if

184
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,160
you're

185
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,440
or sorry multiplied by one the payoff

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,280
you get

187
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,720
for cooperating

188
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,560
plus one the payoff you get for

189
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,639
cooperating multiplied by the discount

190
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,520
factor on out in repeating out into the

191
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,120
future

192
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,120
and this actually just simplifies down

193
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,000
to one

194
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
and

195
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,319
then if you choose to defect your payoff

196
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,880
is going to be equal to one minus the

197
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,520
discount factor multiplied by two that

198
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,360
payoff you get for defecting

199
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,800
right now plus

200
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,880
zero multiplied

201
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,720
the best zero which is the best possible

202
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,800
payoff you can get after choosing to

203
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,960
defect now that you know your opponent

204
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
is choosing to defect every single time

205
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,960
multiplied by the discount factor on out

206
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,039
into the future and this simplifies down

207
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,479
to two minus one d

208
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,520
and so when we

209
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,199
and when we

210
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,120
put these equations together we find

211
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,960
that the payoff to cooperate is greater

212
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,319
than the payoff to defect

213
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,520
as long as the discount factor is

214
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,680
greater than one half so for cooperation

215
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,080
to have a higher payoff than defecting

216
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,280
the future payoff must be worth at least

217
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
half of the current payoff

218
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,319
however

219
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,160
if you do choose to trade your opponent

220
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
you know that they will play defect

221
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,440
indefinitely

222
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
so then your payoff to cooperate is

223
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,440
going to be equal to 1 minus the

224
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,240
discount factor

225
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,080
my multiplied by negative one the payoff

226
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,639
you get for cooperating when you know

227
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,120
your opponent is going to defect plus

228
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,479
zero the best possible payoff you'll get

229
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,240
the next round

230
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,080
uh with your opponent defecting

231
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,919
multiplied by the discount factor on out

232
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,759
into the future which simplifies down to

233
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,080
d minus one

234
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,759
and the payoff to defect is going to be

235
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,080
one minus d

236
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,400
multiplied by zero the payoff you get

237
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,000
for defecting along with your opponent

238
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,440
plus zero the best possible payoff you

239
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,840
can get multiplied by the discount

240
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,520
factor again on out into the future

241
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,599
and so the payoff to cooperate in this

242
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,680
scenario is only greater to the payoff

243
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,840
to defect

244
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,400
when d is greater than one which isn't

245
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,919
possible because it's a percentage so

246
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,879
if you believe your opponent is using a

247
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,039
grim trigger strategy once you have

248
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,520
defected it is better to continue to

249
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,520
defect

250
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,120
so

251
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,960
next we're going to talk about

252
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,560
brinksmanship which is defined as the

253
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,400
practice of trying to achieve an

254
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
advantageous outcome by pushing

255
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,719
dangerous events to the blink of a brink

256
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,959
of active conflict

257
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,640
so here we have another scenario between

258
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,839
alice and bob where alice and bob are

259
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,399
playing a game of chicken

260
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,120
and each player has the option to swerve

261
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,120
or to stay

262
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,360
and if both players swerve they tie

263
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,600
if one player swerves while the other

264
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,880
one stays the one that stays wins the

265
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,279
game of chicken

266
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,760
however if both players stay and neither

267
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,440
of them swerve they crash and so again

268
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,080
like in our last model we can translate

269
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,519
this into a payoff matrix essentially

270
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,519
ranking the outcomes for each player

271
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,760
so

272
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,560
like our previous game this is a

273
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,160
simultaneous game

274
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,920
and

275
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,600
all our players can base their decisions

276
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,440
off of is what they believe that their

277
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
opponent will do

278
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,760
so if alice believes that bob will

279
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,519
choose to swerve she'll choose to stay

280
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
to win the game for that highest payoff

281
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,240
of two

282
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,720
and if she believes that bob will choose

283
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,560
to stay she'll choose to swerve for to

284
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,880
avoid the crash and for that higher

285
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
payoff of zero

286
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,760
and

287
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,760
bob is in the same situation and has the

288
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,360
same payoffs

289
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,360
choosing to

290
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,320
stay if he believes alice will swerve

291
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,800
and swerve if she stays so our two

292
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,440
national nash equilibriums

293
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,120
are where alice stays and bob swerves

294
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,120
and alice swerves and bob stays

295
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,320
now

296
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,480
what if they had different motivations

297
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,720
what if instead of bob being alice's

298
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,440
opponent alice's opponent opponent was

299
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,760
say a stuntman in a stunt car who could

300
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,880
take a crash without as much damage as

301
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,040
she could

302
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,560
in this scenario our stuntman would

303
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,480
choose to stay

304
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,160
whether or not he believed alice choose

305
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,880
to swerve or stay

306
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,720
so this makes our nash equilibrium an

307
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,720
outcome where alice chooses to swerve

308
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
and the stuntman would choose to stay

309
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,680
instead of what we saw with two equally

310
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,519
matched opponents like alice and bob

311
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,360
so going back to the alice and bob

312
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,440
example

313
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,360
here we have a decision tree that models

314
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
the same payoff matrix we showed for

315
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,200
alice and bob

316
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,440
alice has the choice to stay or swerve

317
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,600
and then next bob has the choice to stay

318
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
or swerve now because this is a

319
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,440
simultaneous game

320
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,320
bob doesn't actually know whether alice

321
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,399
has chosen to stay or swerve swerve he

322
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,360
doesn't know which node on our decision

323
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,279
tree he's at and so this is

324
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,880
and this uh dotted line between our two

325
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,440
bob nodes denotes that lack of

326
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,440
information

327
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,399
so

328
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,800
enrinksmanship is essentially the act of

329
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,640
removing one of these options

330
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,160
so let's say

331
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,360
as alice is driving she calls out hey i

332
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,120
cut my brakes i can't stop

333
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
what alice essentially does in that

334
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,120
scenario

335
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,399
is she removes half of the tree she says

336
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,959
i am not going i cannot swerve

337
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,480
i'm going to stay

338
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,360
you have to make your choice based on

339
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,079
that and so then bob knows exactly where

340
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,519
he is he has to choose to stay or swerve

341
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,040
based on

342
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,519
his knowledge that alice will choose to

343
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,519
stay and that spreadship is is

344
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,240
essentially removing half of the

345
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,320
decision tree using a dangerous action

346
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,839
to force your opponent into making a

347
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,839
decision based on that

348
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,800
so next we're going to look at a very

349
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,200
simplified down attack defense scenario

350
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
between

351
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,959
two players an attacker and a defender

352
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,120
and essentially the defender has the

353
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,240
choice to choose to monitor their stuff

354
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
or not

355
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,120
and the attacker has the choice to

356
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,560
attack a system they come across or to

357
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,440
ignore it and move on to the next thing

358
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,200
and

359
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,040
so and if

360
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
an attacker believes the defender is

361
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,200
going to be monitoring a system they're

362
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,000
not they're going to pass on attacking

363
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,440
it

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,959
however if they believe the system is

365
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,240
not monitored they're going to choose to

366
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,440
attack

367
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,279
likewise

368
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,880
if a defender believes their systems

369
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,680
will be attacked they'll choose to

370
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,320
monitor but if they believe they won't

371
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,480
they won't choose to monitor

372
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,560
so unlike in our previous games we don't

373
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,839
have a nash equilibrium or a logical

374
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,839
outcome to the game

375
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,200
so to start to find an equilibrium we're

376
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,720
going to look at p the likelihood the

377
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,639
defender will choose to monitor their

378
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
systems in the first place

379
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,480
and so for an attacker the expected

380
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,959
value of attacking something they come

381
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,480
across is equal to p the likelihood the

382
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,880
system is monitored

383
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,800
multiplied by the payoff

384
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,639
the system they attack they get if the

385
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,399
system they attack is monitored that

386
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
payoff of negative 10

387
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,360
plus 1 minus p or the likelihood the

388
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,680
system is not monitored plus 10 which is

389
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,920
the payoff of attacking a system that's

390
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,279
not monitored so the expected value of

391
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,000
attacking is going to be equal to

392
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,600
negative 10 p plus 10 multiplied by one

393
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,600
minus p

394
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,000
and the expected value of passing is

395
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,560
always going to be equal to zero

396
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,639
so when we set those equal to each other

397
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,720
we get p is equal to one half this means

398
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,320
that p is equal to one half or if it's

399
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,399
50 50 whether

400
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,399
system is monitored the attacker is

401
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,440
indiff is forced into indifference about

402
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,440
whether or not they attack

403
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,600
and we can see this with this graph that

404
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,959
i have here essentially the expected

405
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,040
value to the attacker goes down

406
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,839
as the likelihood that this uh the

407
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,920
system is being monitored increases

408
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,320
and so

409
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,320
and so by uh by changing p

410
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,560
defenders can actually force the

411
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,760
attackers into indifference

412
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,880
or into making a different decision

413
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,720
now

414
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,720
what happens when one player can lie

415
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,160
how

416
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,600
we saw how information can change an

417
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,519
outcome of a game

418
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
but how do we actually change that

419
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,800
information

420
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,560
well using a signaling game we can start

421
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,120
to look at what happens when a player

422
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,880
starts to use or starts to

423
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
signal with information that may or may

424
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,399
not be false

425
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,320
in order to in order to force their

426
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,320
opponent into a different outcome

427
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,000
so for our signaling game we're going to

428
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,160
look at the same game with two players

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,079
attackers and defenders but this time

430
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,160
our defenders are either high or low

431
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,480
quality

432
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,920
and attackers want to attack low quality

433
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,320
defenders

434
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,839
now any defender can signal that it's a

435
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,880
high quality defender and its systems

436
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,959
are secure

437
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,920
but signaling comes at a cost and this

438
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,519
cost is higher for low quality defenders

439
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,279
and i should talk for a minute about

440
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,800
what a signal actually looks like

441
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,360
because there is a big difference

442
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,199
between a credible signal and one that's

443
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,160
not for example

444
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,240
if a company tweets on twitter

445
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,800
we're unhackable we're gonna see them go

446
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,959
down in probably the next three hours

447
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,079
um but a lot of signals we see are

448
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,440
things like

449
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,360
buying

450
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,279
buying overpriced you know security

451
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,600
systems that never actually get properly

452
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,639
implemented stuff like that and this is

453
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,040
a bit of an abstract example but

454
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,399
or the uh this model is a bit abstract

455
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,800
but it's good to keep those real world

456
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,880
examples in mind

457
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,440
now one thing to keep in mind is the

458
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,839
attacker does not know what capabilities

459
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,600
the defender it comes across has this

460
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,160
makes this game a game with incomplete

461
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,160
information

462
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,120
so here i have another decision tree for

463
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,279
our signaling game

464
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,199
and the first move is just a move by

465
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,399
nature determining whether any given

466
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,759
defender is high or low quality and

467
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,480
we're going to say high quality

468
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,120
defenders appear at a percentage of

469
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,120
one third or 33 percent of the time

470
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,959
and uh low quality defenders who can't

471
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,279
monitor their stuff

472
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,120
appear at a percentage of 66 percentage

473
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,959
of the time

474
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,360
next is the choice by the individual

475
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,600
defender to signal that they're a high

476
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,480
quality defender or not and of course

477
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,199
that signal comes at a cost

478
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,759
and finally the choice by the attacker

479
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
to attack or pass and the dotted line

480
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,000
between these attacker nodes here

481
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,480
signals that the attacker does not know

482
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,399
which part of the tree that it's on

483
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,880
the attacker knows only that they've

484
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,639
seen a signal not whether or not

485
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,639
the defender is high or low quality

486
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,559
so first we're going to look for a

487
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,880
separating equilibria where different

488
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,600
players do different things

489
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,360
so

490
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,480
we're going to say if a defender is high

491
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,600
quality

492
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,039
they'll choose to signal and if a

493
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,480
defender is low quality they'll choose

494
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,720
not to signal

495
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,559
in this scenario if an attacker sees a

496
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,079
signal they'll choose to pass

497
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,240
knowing that

498
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,360
high quality defenders are signaling 100

499
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,280
of the time

500
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,799
and if they see no signal they'll choose

501
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,120
to attack knowing that low quality

502
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,160
defenders are not signaling 100 of the

503
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,280
time

504
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,720
now this doesn't this uh this equilibria

505
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,080
actually fails

506
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,919
because

507
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,600
if we see our low quality defenders are

508
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,039
choosing not to signal and are getting

509
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,240
attacked for that payoff of negative ten

510
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,720
however

511
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,120
if attackers are passing on 100 of

512
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,120
signals

513
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,360
it's worth it for low quality defenders

514
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,039
to choose to choose to pay to signal for

515
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,039
that payoff of 10 instead

516
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,480
and so uh so this does so this

517
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,480
separating equilibria doesn't work

518
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,160
so next we're going to look for a

519
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,919
pooling equilibrium where all defenders

520
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,000
choose to signal

521
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,679
if all defenders are signaling attackers

522
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,080
are going to attack x percent of the

523
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,760
time based on the probability the signal

524
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,039
is coming from a high or low quality

525
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,720
defender

526
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,400
and the probability of the signal coming

527
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,960
from a high quality defender is

528
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,960
one-third the rate at which they appear

529
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,320
based on nature and the probability of

530
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,840
signals coming from a low quality

531
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,440
defender is going to be equal to

532
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,679
two-thirds based on the rate they appear

533
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,400
in nature

534
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,400
so

535
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
if attackers attack x percentage

536
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,280
oh and the

537
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,360
and the payoff for attacking a high

538
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,880
quality defender is negative 10 the

539
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,919
payoff for attacking a low quality

540
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
defender is 10.

541
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,880
so

542
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,039
the expected value to an attacker of

543
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,720
signaling or of attacking given that

544
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,640
they've seen a signal

545
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,720
is going to be equal to the probability

546
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,960
the signal is coming from a high quality

547
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,640
defender multiplied by that payoff of

548
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,160
attacking a high quality defender that

549
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,760
negative 10

550
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,360
plus the probability the signal is

551
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,200
coming from a low quality defender

552
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,440
multiplied by the payoff of attacking a

553
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,000
low quality defender

554
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,200
and this ends up being equal to three

555
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
and a third

556
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,039
the expected value of passing is always

557
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,200
going to be equal to zero

558
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,600
so in this scenario a hundred percent of

559
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,440
the time the expected value of attacking

560
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,640
is greater than the expected value of

561
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,039
passing so attackers will attack 100 of

562
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,039
the time

563
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,000
so next we're going to look for

564
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,600
semi-separating equilibrium and that's

565
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,200
where if a defender is high quality

566
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,720
they'll choose to signal and if the

567
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,760
defender is low quality they'll choose

568
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,000
to signal x percentage of the time

569
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,520
and so attackers if they given that

570
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
they've seen a signal will choose to

571
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,440
attack why percentage of the time and

572
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,880
given that they've seen no signal will

573
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,600
attack a hundred percent of the time

574
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
so

575
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,360
the problem

576
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,520
and uh here i have the equations for the

577
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,280
probability that the signal comes from a

578
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,640
high quality defender and the

579
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,640
probability if it comes from a low

580
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,320
quality defender which we'll need later

581
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,840
but i won't get into

582
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,679
how how i found that just right now

583
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,520
so first we're going to choose or we're

584
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,760
going to find why the probability the

585
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,360
attacker will attack a defender given

586
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,640
that they've seen a signal so

587
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,559
and to find that we're going to look at

588
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,679
the expected value to a low quality

589
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,760
defender

590
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,840
the expected value to a low quality

591
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,720
defender of signaling is going to be

592
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,640
equal to y

593
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,880
the probability they get attacked

594
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,400
multiplied by the payoff of sending a

595
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,360
signal and getting attacked that

596
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,360
negative 13.

597
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,640
plus one minus y the likelihood the

598
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,400
player is not attacked multiplied by the

599
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,240
payoff of sending a signal and getting

600
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,159
passed on which is that payoff of seven

601
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
and we'll compare that to the expected

602
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,280
value

603
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,960
of not sending a signal which is the

604
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,640
payoff of

605
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,559
getting attacked

606
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,159
or negative 10. and when we set those

607
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,520
equal to each other y is going to be

608
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,320
equal to

609
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,960
17 over 20 meaning that attackers will

610
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,039
attack if they see a signal 17 times out

611
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,200
of 20.

612
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,280
and so what this

613
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,080
uh what this ends up looking like is the

614
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,799
expected value of s of signaling

615
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,799
decreases

616
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,360
as uh as the as as y increases and when

617
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,159
y is equal to 17 over 20 low quality

618
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,679
defenders are

619
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,080
indifferent about whether or not they

620
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,080
signal

621
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,640
and so from there

622
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,840
we're going to do the same thing to find

623
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,720
x the probability a defender

624
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,360
with

625
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,919
low qual or a low quality defender will

626
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,000
signal will signal that they're high

627
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,760
quality and that's going to be based on

628
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,919
the expected value

629
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,919
to an attacker of attacking which is

630
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,360
going to be equal to the probability the

631
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,600
signals coming from a high quality

632
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,000
defender multiplied by the payoff of

633
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,520
attacking a high quality defender plus

634
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,600
the probability the signal is coming

635
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,360
from a low quality defender multiplied

636
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,400
by the payoff of attacking a low quality

637
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,320
defender

638
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,080
and the expected value of passing is

639
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,840
always equal to zero

640
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,480
so when we set those equal and solve for

641
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,240
x x is going to be equal to one fourth

642
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,919
so in this scenario

643
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,200
a quarter of low quality defenders will

644
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,679
signal that they can monitor their

645
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,679
systems

646
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,000
and so again we can graph the expected

647
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,679
value to an attacker as

648
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,080
as x the likely uh the likelihood that

649
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,120
a low quality defender is choosing to

650
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,120
signal increases

651
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,320
the expected value of attacking

652
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,880
increases along with it and when x is

653
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,840
equal to 1 4 attackers are forced into

654
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,840
indifference

655
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,559
so

656
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,159
when we see when we see or is so when we

657
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,600
run through this game with these with

658
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
these numbers

659
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,360
we find uh we find a semi-separating

660
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,280
equilibrium where a quarter of low

661
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,280
quality defenders will signal will

662
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,880
signal that they're high quality and

663
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,960
attackers will attack given that they've

664
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,760
seen a signal 17 times out of 20.

665
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,280
so where do we go from here

666
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,200
i hope to have given you a good

667
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,039
demonstration of how we can break down

668
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,960
conflict into steps

669
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,200
and by going through those steps and

670
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,880
determining the payoffs each step of the

671
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,799
way we can start to model the outcomes

672
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,520
using game theory

673
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,520
i also we can also watch how strata

674
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,960
strategies interact and can change each

675
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,880
other

676
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,799
and i want you to think about where do

677
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,640
you see some some examples of some of

678
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,400
these similar strategies being used on a

679
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,240
regular basis what do you think you can

680
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,240
start to apply this to

681
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,840
now obviously there are some limitations

682
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
i'd say one of the biggest limitations

683
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,880
of game theory is determining payoffs

684
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,559
and motivation in a realistic fashion

685
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,039
the numbers i used in these examples

686
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,559
were just that examples to make the math

687
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,960
come out you know relatively nicely

688
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,279
how uh however when determining payoffs

689
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,679
i often try to look at it is

690
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,799
essentially ranking the outcomes for

691
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,720
each uh for each of the players or

692
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,600
doing amount and from that doing the

693
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,919
amount of net positive or negative but

694
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,480
there are a lot of different ways

695
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,440
and it's often hard it's often hard when

696
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,039
uh

697
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,559
with some of these more complex games

698
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,919
when there are motivations you

699
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,279
potentially may not have been able to

700
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,880
account for

701
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,880
and as these games get more and more

702
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,320
complex of course they're they're harder

703
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,480
they're harder to model especially

704
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,000
without the use of a computer

705
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,000
but we've been using game theory to

706
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,760
model conflict throughout centuries and

707
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,320
i believe when applied to cyber security

708
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,080
we can create complex and robust models

709
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,000
of threat behavior

710
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,080
anyways my name is juno thank you so
