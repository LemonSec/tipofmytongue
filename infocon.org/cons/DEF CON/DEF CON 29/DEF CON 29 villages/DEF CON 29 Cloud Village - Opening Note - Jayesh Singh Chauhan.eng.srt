00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,640
all all here and uh this is the third

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,120
year of cloud village and uh we could

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,960
have we could not have been here with

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,240
all you folks

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,840
so

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,920
yeah we decided to to go virtual this

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,480
year as well we will like we have folks

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,240
like our crew members everyone is just

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,560
uh scattered across different places and

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,000
we just thought it would be the best

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,560
idea to to do this virtual this year and

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,039
make it seamless and probably next year

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,720
we'll be on site

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,760
so with that let me uh start uh

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,200
i like i have a quick little

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200

so uh while we're doing virtual coverage

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,239

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,239
beautiful part about virtual is there is

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,560
no limit to number of attendees and we

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,560
enjoyed that privilege last year and i'm

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
glad this year we were able to do that

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,280
along with defcon's blessing and

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,400

find that in the chat you would have

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,040

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,040
like we've tried our best to to make a

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,320
uh like a setup where we have a decent

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,120
like we we just don't have aws we have

137
