1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,639
media psyops a look into how social

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,120
media

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,359
has been weaponized for psychological

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,160
warfare

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,599
with yours truly be a scilab

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,000
before i get started here's a little bit

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,120
about me

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,519
i'm 14 years old i was the youngest

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,320
speaker at hope

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,880
which stands for hackers on planet earth

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,359
i am a four-time speaker at defcon

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,080
i have also spoken internationally on

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,000
election security at death camp

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,039
in romania i'm a maker and a hacker in

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
my election hacking from the roots

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,760
asylum

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
was highlighted at a congressional

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,000
hearing on election security

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,320
let's start off with the definition and

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,079
then a little history

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,320
psyops is short for psychological

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,960
warfare operations which are military

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,000
operations

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
usually aimed at influencing the enemy's

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,760
state of mind

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,399
through non-combative means techniques

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,680
used by military

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,399
police and political forces to influence

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,440
the beliefs

30
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,800
emotions and behavior of citizens

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,840
at the end of the day it's all marketing

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
but instead of a product they are

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
selling you an ideal

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,159
now for some history it was the year

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,520
329 bc and alexander the great was

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,040
conquering empires all around he quickly

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,680
took over

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
large parts of europe and the middle

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,200
east

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,840
as his armies kept taking over more and

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,799
more land

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,280
the number of soldiers he had started to

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,159
dwindle

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,720
causing alex to wonder if he could keep

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,920
all his new found territory to himself

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,320
that's when alexander the great had a

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,520
brilliant idea

48
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,000
that would intimidate the enemy without

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,240
needing to do much work at all

50
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
after conquering a new city alexander

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
had his armies leave behind large pieces

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,680
of armor

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,799
that would fit a seven foot tall giant

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,360
when the enemy soldiers passed by they

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
would see massive chest plates

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
helmets and boots this surely

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,759
intimidated the opponents

58
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,840
making them wonder if they could ever

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
win a battle against alexander the

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,479
great's

61
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,878
army of giants around the same time

62
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,280
genghis khan also proved that the power

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
of intimidation

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
can go a long way before attacking a

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,160
city

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,239
he would send messengers ahead to tell

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,400
of the horrible huge army

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
that was coming to attack as this

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,080
presumably

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
huge army came into view all you could

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,520
see is a

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
massive dust storm coming your way

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
this wasn't caused by the number of

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,560
soldiers in the army

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
but rather by rocks and heavy objects

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,200
that the horses dragged along behind

77
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,840
them

78
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,040
creating the illusion of a large army

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
his archers also shot arrows that would

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,280
whistle in the air

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
further intimidating the enemy

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,360
now we will jump ahead to war one and

83
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,720
world war ii

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,519
back in 1914 the germans were the first

85
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,319
to send pamphlets to the enemy troops

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,640
after observing how well these tactics

87
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,360
worked the united states decided to jump

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,680
in

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,319
and make some propaganda of their own

90
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,879
these leaflets had topics such as

91
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,640
how great the american troops were

92
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,599
performing and how poorly the german

93
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,040
troops were doing

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,840
each nation also used psyops on their

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,200
own citizens

96
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,360
sometimes leading them to believe that

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,560
they were winning

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,920
even if that fact may not be true

99
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
the german military also used radio

100
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,879
messages to state that the troops wives

101
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,840
were sleeping with

102
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,319
other men while they were at war so they

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,360
should surrender

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,959
and go home right away each nation used

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,840
propaganda on their own citizens as well

106
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
they did this in order to get them to

107
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,360
enlist in the military

108
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,440
or to have them send money and supplies

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,120
to help the troops

110
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
in vietnam war the u.s military played a

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,519
soundtrack

112
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,720
called ghost tape number 10 in the

113
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
vietnamese jungles at night to persuade

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,120
the troops to surrender

115
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
u.s forces hoped that the operation

116
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,879
codenamed wandering seoul would weaken

117
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
the morale of the viet cong

118
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,000
and prey on the fears of many vietnamese

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,720
the vietnamese culture includes beliefs

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,600
and rituals

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,918
that show respect for the dead they

122
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,120
believe if a person

123
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,680
is not properly buried they will wander

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,880
the earth as a

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
wandering soul in the gulf war

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,320
psychological tactics were very

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,280
successful

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,000
because they threatened consequences to

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,520
those who did not abide

130
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,560
by the coalition's rules the american

131
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,080
military also promised

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,639
the iraqi troops that no harm would come

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,280
to them

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,360
and they would be treated very well if

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,720
they surrendered

136
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,880
these messages were delivered by air

137
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
dropping pamphlets and by radio

138
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
as it was one of the few options the

139
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,759
soldiers in the field had to distract

140
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,759
themselves from the war

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,080
many iraqi troops surrendered holding

142
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,759
that pamphlet

143
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,560
the arabs also tried some psyops tactics

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
on the u.s forces

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
using a broadcaster by the name of

146
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,520
baghdad betty

147
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,440
she told the soldiers that while they

148
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,600
were out at war their wives were at home

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
sleeping with celebrities such as mel

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
gibson

151
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,560
tom cruise and bart simpson

152
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
this illustrates why you need to do

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
research on your target audience

154
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,919
before launching a campaign you may be

155
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,720
wondering

156
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,440
how can a tiny piece of paper or radio

157
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
message make a soldier

158
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,919
give up all he has already sacrificed

159
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,400
and

160
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
how can warning messages intimidate

161
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
entire armies

162
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,960
to answer these questions let's take a

163
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,759
deeper look

164
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,960
into each of the prior examples before

165
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,600
any psyops attack is used on an enemy

166
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
they're usually tired hungry stressed

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,880
and

168
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,680
even depressed this makes them even more

169
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
susceptible to psychological

170
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,720
manipulation

171
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
all propaganda typically ties into one

172
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,680
or more of the seven deadly sins

173
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,120
lust gluttony pride sloth wrath

174
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
greed and envy these seven sins

175
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
are the greatest desires known to

176
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,520
humankind

177
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,840
so avoiding these feelings in such a

178
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,880
horrible condition

179
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,000
is virtually impossible additionally

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
they play on the strong human emotions

181
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,199
of anger

182
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,400
fear and hate these emotions are

183
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,880
also the easiest to stir up in an

184
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,639
individual

185
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,800
with that in mind let's look back on

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,160
alexander the great

187
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
and why he left behind those large

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,440
pieces of armor

189
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
remember back then the average height

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,479
was

191
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,440
much shorter than people today picture

192
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,000
yourself

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,560
as one of the soldiers tracking down

194
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,919
alexander's army

195
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,639
and finding giant pieces of armor that

196
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,880
are twice the size of yours

197
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,800
that would definitely strike fear in

198
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
your heart

199
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,039
genghis khan used the power of false

200
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,000
numbers to his

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
advantage as he stormed through cities

202
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,440
and towns

203
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,880
this time imagine yourself as a soldier

204
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,680
in a city near a dusty plain that goes

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:11,919
on

206
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,360
as far as the eye can see suddenly

207
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,440
you hear the sounds of what you believe

208
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,000
to be thousands of horse hooves in the

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,039
distance

210
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,000
a huge cloud of dust appears as you

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,639
watch your

212
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,440
certain doom approaching practically

213
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,639
engulfing your seemingly tiny army by

214
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,840
comparison

215
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,759
again fear was the emotion used here

216
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,560
in the times of war 1 and world war ii

217
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,319
you would see propaganda

218
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,880
everywhere in your town coming in forms

219
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,520
such as

220
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,319
posters billboards newspaper ads and

221
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,440
pamphlets

222
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,240
these posters included sayings such as i

223
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,120
want you

224
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,080
for the us army which plays on pride in

225
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,960
this one

226
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
he volunteered for the submarine service

227
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
which plays on lust that covers things

228
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,000
back home

229
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
but what about campaigns on the front

230
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,440
lines

231
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,919
because of the british blockade getting

232
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,440
food to germany was

233
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,240
virtually impossible leaving the german

234
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,120
troops with

235
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
little rations this gave the british the

236
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,759
idea to send leaflets

237
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,160
with pictures of their soldiers eating

238
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
great food and smiling brightly

239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,039
many men went to sleep hungry that night

240
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,000
while still holding that paper in hand

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
this is a perfect example of the use of

242
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,599
gluttony

243
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,719
in a psyops campaign now

244
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,760
picture yourself as a vietnamese soldier

245
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,399
walking through a dark damp jungle in

246
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,599
the middle of the night

247
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,279
you're tired hungry and just want to go

248
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,800
back home to your family

249
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
who you haven't seen in weeks when

250
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,480
suddenly

251
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,240
you hear the sound of your fellow

252
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,839
soldiers who have died

253
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,160
their souls wandering through the jungle

254
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,120
forever

255
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,360
in the eerie sounds of buddhist funeral

256
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,240
music

257
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,959
screaming crying and the sounds of

258
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,480
ghosts and spirits

259
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,839
let's take a listen

260
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:17,789
[Music]

261
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,610
um

262
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,669
[Music]

263
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,040
at the time of the gulf war the u.s sent

264
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,600
pamphlets out to the arabian soldiers

265
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,680
telling them that if they surrendered

266
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
they would treat them

267
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,440
very well and no harm would come these

268
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,279
pamphlets were designed

269
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,680
with the help of cooperative iraqi

270
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,200
prisoners of war

271
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,920
they advise to avoid using the color red

272
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,080
and to feature soldiers with bowls of

273
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,720
fruit

274
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
including bananas bananas are a delicacy

275
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
to the arabians

276
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,640
this played on the sins of greed and

277
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,680
gluttony

278
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,880
back then they put propaganda wherever a

279
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,360
large

280
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
number of people would see it every day

281
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,920
like posters at a grocery store

282
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
or an ad in a newspaper these days what

283
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,519
is a widely used means of sharing

284
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
opinions and information

285
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,040
that's right social media eighty-two

286
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
percent of u.s citizens

287
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
have a social media profile most likely

288
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,040
you have one too propaganda used to be a

289
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,000
blunt tool

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
and had to be tailored to appeal to a

291
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,000
large general audience

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,959
with social media ads can be targeted

293
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,680
directly to a specific audience

294
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,519
making it more likely for someone to

295
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,480
engage with the adversary's idea

296
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,760
there are many social media outlets but

297
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,399
we will be focusing on two of the big

298
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,040
ones

299
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,000
facebook and twitter have you ever

300
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,240
noticed that your social media ads seem

301
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,200
to be targeting

302
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
you the other day you are looking up

303
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,040
cupcake recipes

304
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,440
and suddenly your facebook feed is

305
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,240
recommending

306
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,839
the baking topic and ads for mixers

307
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,320
that is because the algorithm is

308
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
targeting you

309
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,680
by tracking your likes searches who you

310
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,320
follow and who you interact with

311
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
you also have a digital fingerprint that

312
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,519
ties

313
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,399
all your devices searches apps and

314
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,279
pretty much

315
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,240
everything you do online together

316
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,519
facebook and twitter

317
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,320
know you better than you know yourself

318
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,079
the data from the algorithm

319
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,560
helps them recommend topics and more

320
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
importantly

321
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
they can target advertising directly to

322
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,519
you

323
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,640
this very accurate targeting is why

324
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
social media has been the preferred

325
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,680
delivery method

326
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,639
for modern psyops if you have already

327
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,279
done some research in modern psyops

328
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,680
then this name will be no stranger to

329
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,720
you

330
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
cambridge analytica cambridge analytica

331
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,800
was a political consulting firm that

332
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
used large data sets

333
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,760
to target and change the minds of voters

334
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
though the parent company was located in

335
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,200
great britain

336
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,760
they saw a big opportunity in the united

337
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,800
states

338
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,000
back in 2016 consultants working for

339
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,399
donald trump's presidential campaign

340
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,040
sought out cambridge analytica to help

341
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,959
him and his campaign team

342
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,480
win the 2016 presidential election

343
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,839
trump's campaign spent over 44 million

344
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,800
dollars to run

345
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,639
5.9 million facebook ads at its peak

346
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,200
cambridge analytica was spending over

347
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
one million dollars a day

348
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,240
on facebook ads alone meanwhile

349
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,279
hillary's campaign spent 28 million

350
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,639
on only 66 000 ads

351
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,959
how are these ads so successful for

352
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,160
trump

353
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,720
it all starts with facebook personality

354
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,639
surveys

355
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,600
jane bambauer professor of law at the

356
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,959
university of arizona best describes how

357
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,279
these surveys started out

358
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,240
in 2014 alexander kogan a young

359
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,560
professor at cambridge university

360
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,360
made a personality quiz called this is

361
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,880
your digital life

362
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
that attempted to categorize the people

363
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,839
who took it into a set of psychological

364
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,639
profiles almost everyone who took the

365
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,920
quiz agreed to let him

366
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
access not only their public account

367
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,680
information

368
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
all of it including every like

369
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,360
but also the profiles of their friends

370
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,000
that's how a few hundred thousand survey

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,720
takers

372
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,839
grew into a database of 87 million

373
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,040
people and even though only those

374
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
few hundred thousand took the

375
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,079
personality quiz

376
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,800
that mapped their psychometric profile

377
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
the researcher could use their results

378
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,360
to build a statistical model

379
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,519
that could then predict the psychometric

380
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,720
profiles of the

381
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,079
other 86 million facebook users

382
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,480
the profiles were then provided to the

383
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,079
researchers company

384
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,880
cambridge analytica which used them as

385
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,720
assets to try to get political

386
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,160
consulting clients

387
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,760
like donald trump in 2015

388
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,920
facebook changed its policies to

389
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,800
restrict

390
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,959
how third-party companies collect

391
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,560
information from facebook

392
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,199
users by the time the change was

393
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,320
implemented

394
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,199
cambridge analytica had already received

395
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,720
the data

396
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,440
cambridge analytica used facebook

397
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,959
personality surveys

398
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,959
to sort people into a few main

399
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,160
categories

400
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,560
the survey coupled with other facebook

401
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,639
data they were able to collect

402
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,320
created what is known as an ocean score

403
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,600
ocean also known as the big five stands

404
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,000
for

405
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,440
openness conscientiousness extroversion

406
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,480
agreeableness and neuroticism

407
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,040
depending on your ocean score they would

408
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,680
determine

409
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,160
if you are persuadable who is someone

410
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,760
whose political views

411
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,560
could easily be changed they would then

412
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,120
target

413
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,320
all their ads at the persuadables they

414
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,519
didn't worry about

415
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,079
all the persuadables across the country

416
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:18,560
they

417
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,839
only focused on the swing states florida

418
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,040
wisconsin pennsylvania and michigan

419
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
they knew if they flipped these few

420
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
states they would win

421
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
the election one example of an

422
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
ad campaign that cambridge analytica

423
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,560
created was the crooked hillary campaign

424
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,759
the logo included handcuffs as the o's

425
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,199
in crooked their slogan was lock her

426
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,320
up their art department would create

427
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
many uncredited images and post them to

428
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,240
facebook

429
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,560
people who received these ads would not

430
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,320
only like and share the ad

431
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,399
but would screenshot it and share it to

432
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,320
other social media platforms

433
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
effectively free advertising cambridge

434
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,480
analytica

435
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,120
created the spark and social media

436
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,399
became the flame

437
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,600
ending with the explosive 2016

438
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
election results it is likely we will

439
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,360
never

440
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,480
again have free and fair elections where

441
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,000
candidates are chosen

442
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
by their platform and ideas instead of

443
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,680
lies and fake advertising

444
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,560
as you can see these ads use childish

445
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,320
bullying tactics such as

446
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,440
name calling as well as playing on wrath

447
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,639
fear and pride cambridge was at its

448
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,240
high point following the 2016 elections

449
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,519
when whistleblowers like britney kaiser

450
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,800
and chris wiley decided to take a stand

451
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,199
against the company after pleading

452
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,920
guilty for taking people's personal data

453
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
and refusing to give it back

454
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,880
the company declared bankruptcy and shut

455
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,320
down for good

456
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
but this can't be the end of the story

457
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,199
what happened to all that data

458
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,480
i'm sure it wasn't simply deleted

459
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,880
after seeing how powerful that company

460
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
was it should come as

461
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,039
no surprise that their business closing

462
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,400
opened up the new era of

463
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,319
disinformation for hire cambridge

464
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,199
analytica

465
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,599
showed that there was big money to be

466
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,520
made in disinformation

467
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,480
since then dozens of private firms have

468
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,919
popped up in a space

469
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,319
previously occupied solely by

470
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,520
governments

471
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,840
social media has offered the tools to

472
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,320
sow disinformation at a scale to affect

473
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,480
anything from a small local government

474
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,440
election

475
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,760
to spreading disinformation about

476
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,960
coveted vaccines

477
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,720
or even upsetting a country's election

478
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,960
this can be seen today as

479
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,080
spanish-language

480
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,000
anti-vaccine ads are pushed on facebook

481
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,559
and going back to cambridge analytica

482
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,559
they were able to flip the elections

483
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,760
in trinidad and tobago they were hired

484
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,000
by

485
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
the majority indian united national

486
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,760
congress party

487
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
to defeat the incumbent people's

488
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,280
national movement

489
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,559
which primarily attracts

490
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,720
afro-trinbagonian

491
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,919
voters they researched both audiences

492
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,559
and decided to target the young voters

493
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,600
they knew the young indian unc voters

494
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
would do what their parents told them to

495
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,120
do and they would go out

496
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,000
and vote for the unc so they focused

497
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,799
their efforts on the afro-trinbagonian

498
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,600
voters

499
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,640
creating a campaign called do so to

500
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,200
increase

501
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,480
apathy towards voting and politics in

502
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,200
general

503
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,640
encouraging them not to vote did this

504
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,200
tactic

505
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,799
work yes it did the united national

506
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,080
congress party

507
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,640
won the election in case you are

508
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,799
thinking this is recent news

509
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,080
this happened back in 2010 meaning that

510
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,240
this sort of election manipulation

511
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,640
has been going on for a long time

512
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,559
besides creating campaigns

513
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,960
and posting to social media these

514
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,160
private firms

515
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,559
offer the ultimate power in a

516
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,840
disinformation campaign

517
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,679
deniability governments and political

518
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,480
figures

519
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,880
can contract these disinformation

520
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,840
companies

521
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,559
to do their dirty work making it very

522
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,440
difficult to trace it back to the source

523
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,840
content farms produce thousands of

524
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
legitimate looking accounts

525
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,480
complete with an untraceable unique

526
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,600
profile picture

527
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
and a posting history as well legitimate

528
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,520
user data

529
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,400
can be purchased on the dark web to

530
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,480
further assist in targeting

531
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,919
this disinformation the bonus is real

532
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,880
people spread

533
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,240
these conspiracies and lies by sharing

534
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,200
and reposting on multiple platforms

535
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,840
giving a

536
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,640
huge return on a relatively small

537
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,840
investment

538
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,559
if you tell a lie big enough and keep

539
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,600
repeating it

540
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,080
people will eventually come to believe

541
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,960
it

542
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,679
donald trump has been doing this even

543
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,320
before

544
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,200
he was out of office he told his

545
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,880
constituents that if he

546
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,080
didn't win the election it was ripped

547
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,799
conditioning his followers to rise up if

548
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,880
he did not win the election

549
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,039
once the election results were certified

550
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,080
and joe biden

551
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,400
was declared the winner trump started

552
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
claiming the election

553
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
was rigged stirring up wrath in his

554
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,440
followers

555
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,080
leading to the january 6 attack on the

556
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,280
capital

557
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,440
trump still tells the lie that the

558
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,720
election was rigged

559
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,000
despite the total lack of evidence yet

560
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,799
his followers believe it the underlying

561
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,480
message to his followers

562
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,039
is if you don't win something it's

563
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,480
because it was stolen from you cambridge

564
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,280
analytica

565
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
wasn't the only one persuading voters in

566
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,400
the us

567
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
russian actors also used social media to

568
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,760
cause havoc

569
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,159
and divide the country why in the world

570
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,840
would russia do this

571
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,559
unlike cambridge analytica they are not

572
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,600
out to gain money

573
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,240
but rather power soviet premier

574
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,440
khrushchev

575
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,799
said we do not have to invade the united

576
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,600
states

577
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,799
we will destroy you from within that is

578
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,080
exactly what russia

579
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,720
is doing dividing the country so it

580
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,880
destroys itself from within

581
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
i wonder why everyone tries to gain

582
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,080
power by

583
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,240
belittling others instead of bettering

584
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,440
themselves

585
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,679
if the world was in friendly competition

586
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,640
with each other

587
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,440
we could have made so much more progress

588
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
as a society

589
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,679
the russian actors created facebook

590
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,880
accounts and groups

591
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,640
as well as twitter bots all

592
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
impersonating us citizens

593
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,080
and organized groups one example of this

594
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,120
is south united as you can see here

595
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,480
this ad was paid for in rubles

596
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,200
people follow these accounts and like

597
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,280
and repost the content

598
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,159
one of the ad tools at facebook allows

599
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:00,880
you to send

600
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,640
ads to friends and people who also

601
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,840
follow

602
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,000
and then you can pick from thousands of

603
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,559
different keywords

604
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,280
the russians also make fake news

605
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,760
websites that appear to be real news

606
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,960
sources but are actually fake when

607
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
bob goes on facebook and reads an

608
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,159
article on how

609
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,039
hillary is crooked he's probably not

610
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,559
going to check the source

611
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,880
or compare to other sites to see if this

612
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,480
information is true

613
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,600
he will however like comment

614
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,480
and repost this article so that all his

615
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
friends can do the same

616
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,039
and so on and so forth the younger

617
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,799
audience may be thinking

618
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,840
yeah of course it's fake i can tell but

619
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,320
you have to understand that the older

620
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,760
audience was brought up

621
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,559
believing all new sources are fully fact

622
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,440
checked

623
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,919
they have applied this belief to all

624
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,240
modern delivery platforms

625
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,360
after all facebook is where i connect

626
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
with family and friends

627
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,760
why would facebook lie to me anyway

628
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,320
this news article must be real because

629
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,679
the site it's on

630
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
looks real turns out this

631
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,520
newspaper's mailing address is in a

632
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,000
shopping mall between the orange julius

633
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,120
and the piercing pagoda there's

634
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,400
also a building in washington dc full of

635
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,600
mailboxes

636
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,240
this gives any blogger living in his

637
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,360
parents basement

638
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,679
the ability to list a legitimate

639
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,679
sounding physical address

640
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,960
on the bottom of his new site an

641
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,280
interesting fact is that the russians

642
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,039
target both sides

643
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,320
not just one like cambridge did

644
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,120
this way they can divide and conquer in

645
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,840
the u.s

646
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,200
russian influence reached 126 million

647
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
people through facebook alone

648
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,360
they created fake black lives matter

649
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,440
memes and when you clicked on them

650
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,840
you were taken to pages that invited you

651
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,520
to a protest

652
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,840
at the same time they were targeting

653
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
adversary groups

654
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,159
like blue lives matter with similar fake

655
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,039
pages

656
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,440
inviting them to a protest at the same

657
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,240
location

658
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
on the same day the russian government

659
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,240
is organizing

660
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,120
face-to-face protests in order to get us

661
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,400
to fight with each other

662
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,679
and divide the country so far

663
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,240
we have talked about facebook but when

664
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,720
you think about political discussions

665
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,000
your mind goes straight to twitter

666
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,320
just like facebook twitter is used by

667
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,120
russians and

668
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,600
other groups to sow disinformation to

669
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
the american populace

670
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,760
they are using many of the same

671
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,480
techniques that are used on facebook

672
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
one big problem with twitter is the low

673
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,559
bar for entry

674
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,720
this allows groups to use tools that

675
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,080
create many bot accounts

676
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,120
very quickly these accounts then go

677
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,240
and tweet the same things once the bot

678
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,640
gets

679
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,200
caught and blocked they simply create a

680
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
new batch of accounts

681
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,240
the twitter bots also between

682
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,039
other bots tweets as is shown in this

683
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,600
beautiful graphic by daniel gallagher

684
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
it's just like turtlebots all the way

685
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
down i hope

686
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,080
some of you got that reference going

687
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,320
back to the seven sins and lust

688
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,559
these bot accounts frequently feature

689
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,159
beautiful young woman

690
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,559
because the target audience is primarily

691
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,159
male voters

692
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,200
take this account for example

693
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,000
these photos were stolen off a columbian

694
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,120
instagram influencers account

695
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,440
today you got some history some

696
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,400
psychology

697
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,520
and a heavy dose of reality but

698
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,559
what can you do here are a few examples

699
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,520
of how you can protect yourself against

700
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,600
social media psyops

701
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,799
one install an ad blocker this way

702
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,039
you only get feed and not targeted

703
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,080
information

704
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,200
one i highly recommend is the pie hole

705
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,039
which blocks ads on an entire network

706
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,640
two don't take any online quizzes or

707
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
surveys

708
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,679
i know it's tempting to find out what

709
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,200
flavor of ice cream you are

710
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,320
but it's best not to give out personal

711
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
information

712
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,960
as simple and minor as it may seem three

713
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,200
when reading an article check the

714
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,279
sources and who wrote it

715
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,679
always compare it to other articles from

716
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,440
trusted sites

717
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,039
and last but not least four always make

718
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,080
sure to fact

719
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,120
check everything you see and read

720
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,279
never base your opinion on just one

721
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,600
thing and learn what both sides have to

722
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,360
say before making an opinion

723
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,679
i hope everyone learned something today

724
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,320
and i will see you all in person soon

725
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,840
peace out
