1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,560
so welcome everyone thank you for

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,520
joining us um this is the first day

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,879
of the

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,280
um upstate village in this year's def

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,360
con defcon 29

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,880
um

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,920
it was kind of hard for us to cancel

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,279
this year's in-person part again

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,840
after last year as well

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,480
but we felt

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,649
[Music]

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
i'm very excited to have all these

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,560
people joining us virtually

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,040
because it shows me that

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,440
the community lives even without

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,920
the in-person part and this is always

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
very heartwarming

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,239
the good news is that

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,640
the world became a bit smaller with

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
kovit because

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,879
we suddenly have speakers that could

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,680
never come to defcon before that

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,800
um also attendees we have attendees that

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,680
are joining us from all over the world

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,000
and to you i say good morning or good

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
evening or

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
a nice day

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,680
no matter where you are we're happy that

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
you joined us

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
and this is really

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,040
an exciting

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
way for us to start we're going to start

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,080
um our sessions with a panel of

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
specialists

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,200
um

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,520
this is going to be the colorful upset

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,240
red blue or purple

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
panel

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,119
so

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,200
my name is erazy alon i'm the founder

and in this session we will hear from

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
three experts

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,680
each expert will speak for

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
about seven minutes to share their

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,560
perspective

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
or big idea

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,759
one after the other

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,840
um following all three

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,640
three speakers we will have a qa session

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,799
for the remaining time

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
just voice panel you can write a

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,640
question

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,079
in the chat in the text channel

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,520
at any time and i will try to

57
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,079
[Music]

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,000
put all the questions in the discussion

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
in the panel later

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
uh if you have

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,440
a specific speaker you want to ask the

62
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
question please specify that in your

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,959
question

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,040
so let's get started

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,040
first in line we have pedro umbilio

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
security researcher hardware maker

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
software breaker

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,680
red to the bones hacker

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,720
pedo will share with us his red

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,040
perspective take it away

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,480
thanks there is

72
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,959
so hello everyone it's it's really great

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
to be here at defcon 29

74
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,400
as arya says i know that the conditions

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,040
are less than ideal but still it's great

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,120
to see conferences going above and

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
beyond to deliver meaningful content

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
even with the the situation that that

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,480
we've been facing uh almost two years

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,280
now

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,319
so my name is pedro blano aka crypto and

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,560
i've come to talk to you about red team

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,920
exercises and their focus on apsec

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
now i've done my share of red team

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760
exercises throughout the years

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,239
everything from hollywood style social

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,640
engineering designing and placing custom

88
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,879
implants inside an organization office

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
to less elaborate but not necessarily

90
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640
less time consuming

91
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,040
network assessments pen testing code

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
reviewing software reverse engineering

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
and exploitation and so forth

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
what i really want to stress today in

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
this short conversation we are having is

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
the following

97
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
red teams and or general offensive

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,040
security exercises are or should be the

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,879
most realistic exercise that your

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
company can make to stress test the

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
ability to extend and recover from real

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,400
attacks

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,879
so let me rephrase this regular

104
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,879
offensive security exercises are the

105
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,040
most realistic security exercises that

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,879
your company can make

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,040
now it does not matter how solid you

108
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,200
think your defenses are does not matter

109
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
how expensive is your software or

110
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
equipment does not matter how many

111
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,439
issues you solved in your sas report it

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,200
does not matter how agile is your

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
devsecops implemented and it does not

114
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
matter how much money you put in your

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,519
bug bounty program

116
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,160
all of those things they help of course

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,399
but none none of those matters if you

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,880
don't actually test all your defenses in

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,560
a real world scenario

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,880
because attackers won't play nice

121
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
attackers won't respect your rules of

122
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
engagement nor your very well-defined

123
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,680
scope and attackers for sure won't focus

124
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
only on your android application and

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
leave the api servers alone for example

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
they won't leave the database server and

127
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
test it because it's off school so that

128
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,199
won't happen and that's why you should

129
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,479
care

130
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,520
now

131
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,160
this is where red teams shine we think

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,600
like attackers we go beyond cvss or the

133
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
low high low impact vulnerability

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
classification or even bug bounty scores

135
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,919
and rewards

136
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,160
we know malicious attackers are always

137
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
innovating they are figuring out new

138
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
attack vectors and so are we

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,400
they constantly search for new

140
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
vulnerabilities and how to exploit them

141
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
how to stay undetected new ways to

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,560
deploy phishing campaigns and lateral

143
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
movement and so forth and so are we

144
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,039
as a red team

145
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,039
we will be hopefully

146
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,360
the first wave of highly motivated and

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
skilled attackers that a company will

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,880
face

149
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
so in apsec

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,000
red team exercises are often viewed as

151
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
you know some form of code auditing

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
code review application pen testing or

153
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
in some cases a bug bounty program

154
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
that's limited in scope and limited in

155
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,479
time

156
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,479
but it can be and should be much more

157
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,600
than that

158
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,240
because as red teamers we become users

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,199
and we aim for administrators we explore

160
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,759
in-depth your application ecosystem how

161
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
all the pieces interconnect and the

162
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,600
potential vulnerabilities and risks that

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,880
are associated with those

164
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,319
vulnerabilities

165
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,400
because some risks may not even have a

166
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
cvss score worth of mention

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,280
but the pr cost would just be too much

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,639
for example

169
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,319
and this is something that you probably

170
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,560
won't catch on a bug bounty or code

171
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
review

172
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
we are attackers that care about your

173
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
organization and try to figure out how

174
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,080
to inflict harm in every possible way

175
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,759
before others do

176
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,560
now

177
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
i'm not trying to remove value here from

178
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
bug bounty programs they have their

179
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
intrinsic value

180
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,479
in my case sometimes even between

181
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,680
engagements

182
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,759
i i occasionally participate in bug

183
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,400
bounties for fun and of course profit

184
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,560
but here's the thing

185
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,039
i've received bounties on critical

186
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,919
issues more than once and until this day

187
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,199
i still

188
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,759
don't have the you know the the real

189
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,319
idea of what the application was for

190
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,880
i i just knew that i shouldn't be able

191
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
to perform certain operations without

192
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,599
even being authenticated like for

193
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,639
example

194
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,520
delete all users from a system or

195
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
forward avatar reports to the internal

196
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
network

197
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
in a network device

198
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,680
but i never really understood what i was

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,919
attacking nor i had the perspective of

200
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,840
the company core businesses and the

201
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,720
risks they prioritized so

202
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,199
in this sense i wasn't worried about the

203
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,759
organization i was just worrying about

204
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,319
getting a quick a nice bounty

205
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,639
and this is where i think red teams

206
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,039
differentiate at least in my conception

207
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,440
of what the red team should be

208
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,919
we become users of your applications and

209
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,960
we explore them in that from all angles

210
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,680
we try to understand your user base your

211
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,840
business models to have a clear view of

212
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
what's at stake

213
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,759
and in this way we strive to make your

214
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,080
company safer and understand your

215
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,479
organization values and cultures and i

216
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,800
think this goes way beyond an on off

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,120
engagement

218
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,879
i think so

219
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,800
you know red team assessment benefits

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
for organizations i think they are clear

221
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
because organizations can have a

222
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
snapshot in time on how secure they are

223
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,560
at that moment

224
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
they can measure how well devsecops is

225
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,039
benefiting their code for example they

226
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,280
can compare different sustain or code

227
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
analysis tools for performance in the

228
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,199
real world

229
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
and i think importantly organizations

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,919
can identify new risks that are they

231
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,360
were not in the original threat and

232
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,280
attack models so

233
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
in this way they can reliably assess

234
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,759
their state of readiness when a threat

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,840
actor decides to attack

236
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,279
and all of this that we are talking

237
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,440
about is critical information for

238
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
decision makers to properly plan for the

239
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,958
future

240
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,120
and i think it can hardly be obtained by

241
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,880
other means except for a realistic

242
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,519
attack exercise

243
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,160
a red team exercise is not just about

244
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
discovery the organization weaknesses

245
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,640
and vulnerabilities but it's a really an

246
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
attempt to employ lateral and outside of

247
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
the box thinking regarding the overall

248
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
security of the organization and its

249
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,560
business in a way it's a statement

250
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
and it's a clear effort from the

251
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,399
organization to understand their current

252
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,399
security stance and to continuously

253
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,320
improve it while going forward it's a

254
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,839
it's a commitment with secure

255
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,839
development now and for the future

256
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,120
well if you take anything along with uh

257
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,680
with you regarding my intervention here

258
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
i think it i hope it's the following

259
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
red teams and their regular offensive

260
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
security engagements are the most

261
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,920
realistic security exercises your

262
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,880
company can make security wise and in my

263
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,360
opinion one of the best ways to measure

264
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,680
and prepare for real world attacks with

265
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,519
all its implications

266
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,480
and

267
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,160
that's what i had to say

268
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,519
for today

269
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,800
it is

270
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,760
excellent

271
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
thank you so much pedal

272
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,080
thank you a lot of takeaways

273
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
from that

274
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
um so our blue

275
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360

tanya

281
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,519
is

282
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,600

luis chris gomes

295
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,360
he is the one that got away from

296
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
from upsec to the baldur

297
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
he was born a security fanatic now he's

298
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,480
a cso with 14 years in big tech and

299
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
banking blue teams moving now to a more

300
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,720
managed focused role

301
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,360
lewis will will share with us his blue

302
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,480
perspective thank you

303
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,399
thank you

304
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,680
for

305
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
having me um

306
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,240
first of all i'm older of blue teams i

307
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
always see this as a evolution of

308
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
bluetooth

309
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,519
for me

310
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,800
it's

311
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,959
mostly pros

312
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,639
versus joe

313
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,639
lewis

314
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,639
honestly comes from the fact that normal

315
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,839
red in the amount of shine

316
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,720
uh

317
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,360
can you can am i am i speaking too low

318
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,839
or is it

319
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,760
cutting no you are

320
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,319
it's cut

321
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,399
uh what about now

322
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,959
it seems better let's try let's try

323
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,440
again okay

324
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,079
sorry so i need to be uh more a little

325
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
bit faster in order to maintain this

326
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,440
precarious situation that i have on

327
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,399
internet

328
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,120
um so in terms of blue team advances or

329
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,600
the history evolution of blue teams what

330
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
i see happening right now is that up

331
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,639
until now blue teams always relied on

332
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,079
pattern matching

333
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,160
log leaking and being the guys that are

334
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
behind the wheel like we are trying to

335
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
catch up with red teams and the result

336
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,639
of that is that we never get the amount

337
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,519
of time that we need to be creative

338
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,440
and moving forward from the from the

339
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,680
history that we've been uh pursuing up

340
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,120
until now it's always we are a step back

341
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,839
or

342
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,200
or we are a step behind the attackers

343
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,519
the only evolution possible is for us to

344
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,560
leverage

345
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,360
uh machine learning or ai in order to to

346
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,079
remain uh on top of what is pattern

347
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,480
matching of what we do today

348
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,720
but allowing us humans the human part

349
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
the creative part of security to be on

350
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,040
top of our game and creating stuff that

351
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,279
the red team never seen before

352
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,200
because up until now what we what we

353
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
have been seeing is we always try to

354
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,839
catch up to them to people like pedro

355
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,160
or even after when tanya speaks people

356
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,040
like tanya but we never reach that level

357
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,440
of development and moving forward we can

358
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,639
only achieve

359
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
the ultimate blue team security module

360
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
if we are able not only to shift left

361
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,399
but the event driven

362
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,320
and being event driven it's not like uh

363
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,560
there is an action for every security

364
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,639
pattern that we know is actually

365
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,199
creates a layer deeper than that is

366
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,199
being creative enough that the red team

367
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,279
is now after us they need to understand

368
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,600
us instead of us just understanding them

369
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
it's time to level up the playing field

370
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,959
that is my

371
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,880
my ultimate evolution in terms of blue

372
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,760
team as of now

373
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
if you have a possibility you have a

374
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,279
couple more minutes here

375
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,680
okay so uh as a last note i would just

376
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
like to say that uh

377
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
moving forward

378
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,600
this type of situations where you see ml

379
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,760
or ai which is kind of a buzzword to be

380
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
honest but doing it's not only if

381
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,560
clauses right it's actually being data

382
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,680
driven

383
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,760
we are moving into this scenario but

384
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,000
it's really hard for example for any

385
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,399
management uh in security or even

386
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,320
security expert

387
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,399
to really put the ego aside and show the

388
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,040
value of a blue team uh in terms of

389
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,199
being a profit center not a cost center

390
00:14:59,199 --> 00:14:59,920
right

391
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
the only way for us to do that is to be

392
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,560
enablers or to be inside of the way of

393
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,440
working

394
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,920
of companies as of now and we are not we

395
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,040
are

396
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,279
normally the gatekeepers we are the the

397
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,560
guys that are on the door saying hey

398
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,120
this is risky in this pattern before and

399
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,639
we are never bringing up to the table

400
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,880
the research part of work i i bet there

401
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,240
is a thousand blue guys in

402
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,480
in in any of these

403
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
conversations between blue and red team

404
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,639
that want to do more but they are stuck

405
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,240
in doing the the old ways of doing

406
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,560
things like the cms the teams the

407
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,600
all of the

408
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
the tooling instead of the creative part

409
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
of the game

410
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,800
so the evolution of us as a blue team is

411
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,279
to move into a research field not to do

412
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,680
the repetitive tasks that that machines

413
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,439
excel at we don't excel at that

414
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,359
you muted yourself i think

415
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,279
i did i mean um

416
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,560
this was my end point i'm i i was trying

417
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
to make a little bit of

418
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,759
of my own um ideas in the end

419
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,560
but uh also i will leave i'll leave some

420
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
room for developing the questions in the

421
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,560
questions yeah i actually have a lot of

422
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,240
questions to you but uh let's wait for

423
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,839
the panel to

424
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,120
yeah next speaker um is our purple

425
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
expert again tanya janka ceo and founder

426
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
of weak purple

427
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,639
take it away

428
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,639
oh looks like she just disconnected by

429
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,199
accident

430
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,320
yeah

431
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
seems like we have

432
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,719
some technical difficulties today

433
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,160
i have invited her to speak

434
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,680
tanya feel free to hit that button that

435
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,320
you hit last time to join us

436
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,959
hi are you able to hear me now

437
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,640
yes we are

438
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,439
well oh my gosh discord

439
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,559
so many

440
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,720
rude words that i would like to say

441
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
about it but anyway let's talk about

442
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
appstack instead so thank you so much

443
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
for having me

444
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,599
um

445
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,679
so i want to talk about purple team so

446
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,079
the two previous speakers spoke about

447
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,559
you know red team offensive security the

448
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,640
idea of you know testing our bounds

449
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,559
making sure that our defenses actually

450
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,559
work and then of course our other

451
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,240
speakers spoke about blue team like

452
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,559
setting up defenses making

453
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,320
you know making sure all of our bases

454
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,520
are covered

455
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,840
you know uh assessing risk making sure

456
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,200
those risks are covered etc so i like to

457
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
think of purple team as sort of well i

458
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,000
guess collaborative

459
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
application security

460
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
so i know people talk about purple team

461
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
exercises where they pit the red team

462
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
and the blue team

463
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,000
against each other and they kind of you

464
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,880
know

465
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
the red team attacks the blue team

466
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,679
defends and sees you know how it goes

467
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,520
and i know that's a thing but it

468
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,600
actually happens very rarely

469
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
it out in the wild

470
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
it's very very rare people do those

471
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,360
exercises and most the time what is

472
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,559
happening is collaborative security

473
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,799
whenever i've done appsec wherever i've

474
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,360
worked i've been that bridge

475
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,080
between the security team and the devs

476
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,880
i try to break down silos and make sure

477
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
they're actually talking

478
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
i try to like every time the security

479
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,080
team is going to do something that

480
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,160
affects the software developers or the

481
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,880
the devops people i try to talk with

482
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
them about it and pass it by them

483
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
and make sure that i get their opinion

484
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,280
and their feedback and we adjust so that

485
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,120
we're not breaking all the cool stuff

486
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,039
they're doing

487
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
i use a lot of empathy and advocacy so

488
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,400
by empathy i mean i try to figure out

489
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
you know what matters to the security

490
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,799
team what matters to the dev

491
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,919
teams

492
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,039
and then try to adjust accordingly and

493
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,640
you know when we're making decisions try

494
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
to remember this team needs that or that

495
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
team has this deadline or this team

496
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
won't be able to succeed with this

497
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,799
without that and so how can we secure

498
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,960
that so that they can still do it or

499
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,640
what other way could we accomplish the

500
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,799
thing they need but securely

501
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,600
and then with advocacy what i mean is

502
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,400
socializing and spreading the word so

503
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
that can mean sometimes you know me

504
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
giving a lunch and learn

505
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,280
it can mean me holding a consultation so

506
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,760
i've written a new policy i want

507
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
everyone's opinion first before i

508
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
release it i want to talk to teams that

509
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
might not be able to be compliant for a

510
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,000
long time and how we can work together

511
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
to make that happen

512
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,400
and constantly reinforce that no one's

513
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,679
getting fired

514
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,760
i'm not making a policy to run around

515
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,679
and smash people with

516
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,360
making a policy

517
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,559
so that we can try to achieve that

518
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,120
and try to kind of hurt everyone in the

519
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,360
same way so that then we can have

520
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,600
a steady security

521
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
posture across our entire organization

522
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,200
it also means

523
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
putting people

524
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,520
first

525
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,159
and then processes and then tooling and

526
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,240
figuring out how we can make all of

527
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,480
those things function at the absolute

528
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,360
best capacity so i've seen places where

529
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
they you know buy five hundred thousand

530
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,440
dollars worth of super cool appsec tools

531
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,159
and they have the process for actually

532
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,720
pushing out a bug fix is

533
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,159
awful

534
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,480
and the people are frustrated and i'm

535
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,799
like why are we spending 500 000 on

536
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,200
these three tools when instead we could

537
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,520
hire someone to redo the processes or we

538
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,159
could hire a consultant that will set up

539
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,080
a bunch of pipelines for us and automate

540
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,360
this or do you know what i mean and so

541
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,679
like looking from a holistic approach at

542
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,360
all the different things and making sure

543
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
we're not just concentrating on one of

544
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,280
those three pillars

545
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,600
and then the last thing that purple team

546
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,320
really focuses on and this is same with

547
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
all the devops people and all the

548
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,840
security people is continuous learning

549
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
and so you as a security person i'm

550
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
pretty sure everyone listening to this

551
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,320
you're at defcon because you want to

552
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,080
learn because you want to improve

553
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,799
yourself well part of security is us

554
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,039
teaching all the rest of the business

555
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,520
the security lessons that we've learned

556
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,240
and as they apply to them so if you have

557
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,559
people that are product owners teaching

558
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,000
them about why security is value it's

559
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,080
value for the customers it's part of the

560
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
product it is a non-functional

561
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,240
requirement that's absolutely essential

562
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,480
or it's about working with the devs and

563
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,039
teaching them the cool new tool that you

564
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,720
found or tricks that you found for

565
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,799
helping them secure their systems better

566
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,280
or talking to the operations team about

567
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,120
you know there's this vulnerability out

568
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,880
in the wild right now i'm really

569
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,559
concerned about it can we test our

570
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,760
systems

571
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,480
so

572
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
you as a security person spreading and

573
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,200
sharing important knowledge that applies

574
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
to different areas of the business so

575
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,200
you want to continuously learn but you

576
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,640
also want to help the rest of the

577
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,520
business continuously learn security

578
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,080
so that we can meet our goals secure

579
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,919
apps

580
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,000
and that's what i wanted to share the

581
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,559
idea that purple team is collaborative

582
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,640
application security that we bring all

583
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,159
the different teams together we share

584
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,360
the knowledge

585
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
we are the bridge that brings everyone

586
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
together and i know that that sounds

587
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,720
like

588
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,320
you know care bears and hugs and

589
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,200
rainbows but really if you are trying to

590
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
work in absec and you aren't good with

591
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,840
empathy or advocacy like you're gonna

592
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,760
it's an uphill battle every day for you

593
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,360
if you don't know how to negotiate if

594
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,200
you don't know how to persuade

595
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,720
if you don't know how to see anyone

596
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,240
else's side

597
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,120
you're gonna have a really tough time

598
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,520
and that is what i have to say for now

599
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,880
until question period

600
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,159
awesome

601
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,960
yeah so thank you so much for that uh we

602
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,360
got to the panel part of this session

603
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,080
so if anyone has a question

604
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,000
please feel free to write it down in the

605
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,559
colorful absence text channel and we'll

606
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,640
try to dig some questions out of there

607
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,799
but first tony i want to to start with

608
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,400
you uh it's a

609
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,679
it's a

610
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,720
lasting first out so you spoke last

611
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,480
let's say

612
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,559
let's get a bit into this collaborative

613
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,480
security that you talk about because you

614
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,840
mentioned that

615
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,679
what exactly does that mean how does it

616
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,120
look like

617
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,400
uh in a day-to-day basis i'm a developer

618
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,240
in the company what what does a

619
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,240
collaborative security looks like for me

620
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,200
it means that the security team

621
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,559
talks to you

622
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,600
not only when

623
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
not only when there's bad news i

624
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,440
personally

625
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,760
believe that so whenever i start doing

626
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,000
appsec somewhere i want to meet every

627
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
day if i can i want them to know my door

628
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,159
is open

629
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,440
and i start sharing information as soon

630
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,159
as i can so let's say you know i want us

631
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,760
to have a secure coding standard and so

632
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,919
on i'm going to start it off as

633
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,240
conversations so hey we don't have any

634
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,559
sort of standards for secure coding i

635
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,960
really want us to have sam you know

636
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,600
here's one from the book i wrote because

637
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,400
i can do that um but i was hoping we

638
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,960
could start with this what do you think

639
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
like and invite them to meetings talk

640
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,880
with them about it

641
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,559
teach it to them

642
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,080
right because like there'll be junior

643
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,159
devs where it might be new to them and

644
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,760
they'll be senior dabs where maybe they

645
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,240
know it by the back of their hand

646
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,159
for teams supporting lots of legacy

647
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,400
stuff it's like okay so

648
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,159
you don't have to be compliant the first

649
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,559
day with this i understand your app is

650
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,080
old enough to vote

651
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,760
so what can we do to make it um

652
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,559
so what can we do to reduce the risk

653
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,120
the idea of collaborative security is

654
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,679
not i push out rules and they'll have to

655
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,080
jump through these hoops and then make

656
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,760
it through these gates where they can't

657
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,799
get their jobs done it's me helping them

658
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,400
secure their apps

659
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,760
and sometimes helping them means

660
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
teaching them sometimes helping them

661
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,440
means you know getting budget so we can

662
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,919
get a tool that they like using but i

663
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,480
also think does good security

664
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,960
it means when i do a proof of concept i

665
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,880
definitely need their opinion like if

666
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,240
let's say i'm trying to pick like a new

667
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
dashed tool

668
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
i want the devs to come and take a look

669
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
i want their opinion on you know here's

670
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,559
some output from the tool does this make

671
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,559
any sense to you like how could it make

672
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,760
more sense if i'm looking at a few tools

673
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,919
i want to invite some of the devs to

674
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,159
come along and look at the tools with me

675
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,760
because if they're going to use it every

676
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,679
day i think they should their opinions

677
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,200
should be heard

678
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
and so the idea of collaborative

679
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,279
security is

680
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,440
i don't think that that word is new but

681
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
i think security teams actually applying

682
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,159
it with the way they do their work

683
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,480
is somewhat new

684
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
when i was a devs seriously whereas they

685
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,919
would just come to my desk and tell me i

686
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,840
was a shitty dev

687
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,360
they'd just be like we stand it with

688
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,279
this it's garbage i'm like can i use the

689
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,200
scanner tool they're like no

690
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,799
like can i see it no

691
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,640
here's the report i'm like great who can

692
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,880
explain it to me you should know go away

693
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,360
you stuck

694
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,960
i feel like

695
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,840
that's not collaborative

696
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,480
yeah okay so so collaborative basically

697
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
means the opposite of what we see in

698
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,639
most places

699
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,720
yes but i swear it's cheating place

700
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,480
after place they're changing the way

701
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,640
they do things they're trying hard not

702
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,960
every place but i'm seeing big changes i

703
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,159
really am

704
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,600
angry

705
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
so

706
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,000
luis tell me how how much important

707
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
collaboration is in a blue team

708
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,400
well that is one of the most key uh i

709
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,279
would say

710
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,960
develop some that we need to make for

711
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,720
sure for example during incident

712
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,400
procedures one of the things that we

713
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,559
like the most is a

714
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,520
full understanding of the data flows the

715
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
only people that can uh explain to us

716
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,360
normally either are the

717
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,000
sres the devops or the or the developers

718
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,640
right so when we create a war room if we

719
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,600
don't have the necessary connections and

720
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,080
the right mentality to be on board uh

721
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,440
against uh um a unified threat what you

722
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,600
get is like uh you ping somebody on

723
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,799
slack then

724
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,640
the guy is not is not really answering

725
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,559
you need to ping the manager then

726
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,279
creates a scenario like tanya said that

727
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,840
people feel uh fear and accountability

728
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,320
what if i i don't answer what if i take

729
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,720
too much time and in bed the bad

730
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,840
decision flow starts when whenever you

731
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,679
start to rush things right when

732
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,919
everything is clear and you do what the

733
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,039
auditors call fire drills which is in

734
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,399
fact

735
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,320
a similar exercise that we actually put

736
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,960
to the test these types of procedures

737
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,720
that is where you see the biggest flaws

738
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,799
in in collaboration um

739
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,480
one of the good examples that i can give

740
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,679
you is that normally uh we don't even

741
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,559
invite red team

742
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,559
participants to the war rooms it's only

743
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,880
the blue team and a couple of uh asset

744
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,440
managers within the the channel

745
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,159
but i i think that that is a one of the

746
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,760
examples that we need the red team there

747
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,679
because the fresh ideas that come from a

748
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,159
guy that is looking into the eyes of an

749
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,240
attacker are super important also so

750
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,000
everybody that are a part of the system

751
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,960
should be

752
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,799
heard and should be a part of the

753
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,039
conversation that's the only way for

754
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,200
blue teams to live through others not by

755
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,360
themselves trying to put walls or gates

756
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,600
in the middle

757
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,039
so i'm going to ask you a question now

758
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:47,840
from

759
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,279
from the channel

760
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,520
um

761
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,440
from your blue perspective do you think

762
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,520
the time for application security is not

763
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,039
enough as adversaries has basically

764
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,600
unlimited time um this is a question by

765
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,000
a.m

766
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,960
yeah that is interesting like uh the way

767
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,200
that i am evolving the multiple business

768
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,720
units under under my scope for for blue

769
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,960
teaming or what i call

770
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,080
a defensive point of view is that we

771
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,200
integrate

772
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,159
a lot of of threat sources in in

773
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,880
log information right but do we do

774
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,480
anything uh ahead of the attack like do

775
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,080
we do any preparation in terms of uh of

776
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,960
patterns of risk a good example uh would

777
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,000
be

778
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
normally we integrate i'll give a real

779
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,720
life example integrate a new relic and

780
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,480
we put aws information we put a bunch of

781
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,880
thread feeds and i don't know something

782
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
else that in the middle like i don't

783
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,080
know splunk something everything is

784
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
coordinating in terms of events the

785
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,159
number one question that i make for for

786
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,080
absec individuals on on the blue team

787
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,039
side is are you doing anything new that

788
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,440
will create a different layer of of

789
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,159
proportion in terms of uh complexity for

790
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,159
the attacker with that information

791
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,640
instead of just listing the pattern or

792
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,960
verifying a threat risk by combining

793
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,440
multiple sources are you doing anything

794
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,360
new in order to create a different

795
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,880
complexity level a good example would be

796
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,000
for example if we if you white list the

797
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,080
normal human behavior within your your

798
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,559
application like you know that a user

799
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,840
would go for

800
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,559
uh

801
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,640
i mean i'll give you one example from my

802
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,039
world we'll go for classifieds we'll go

803
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,200
for an ad right like you see on ebay

804
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,720
amazon whatever

805
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,960
is it normal for an individual that

806
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,200
connects to that to go directly or from

807
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,919
log

808
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,000
in directly to password

809
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,559
uh do you rate that action in any way

810
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,039
shape or form as a high risk uh action

811
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,039
since he completely bypassed all the

812
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,520
menus that the human would see there and

813
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,159
therefore you put that under scope uh

814
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,159
and the next section would be if the guy

815
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,320
tries to change the password then send

816
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
them a challenge or something and this

817
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,720
will be dynamic behavior right so even

818
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,000
if the guy changed but he's not

819
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,720
following a normal trend of a human are

820
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,240
you able to

821
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,399
capitalize on the massive amount of data

822
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,200
and create a dynamic baseline that is

823
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
always trying to verify the risk level

824
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,320
of an action and create a complexity for

825
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,039
the for the attacker if you do that then

826
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,799
you have enough time because the guy is

827
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,600
always trying to think what can i do

828
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,519
that will mimic a human to a certain

829
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,799
extent

830
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,399
it doesn't know he is probably going to

831
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,080
try to try and create noise and

832
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,600
therefore you will automatically know

833
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,360
that he's an attack uh i don't know if

834
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,919
you is this a good example

835
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,240
yeah yeah it's an excellent example

836
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,840
and this is exactly what we're talking

837
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,399
about here when we try to compare our

838
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,000
efforts with

839
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,559
um let's call it unlimited time that

840
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,320
adversaries have

841
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,840
um

842
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,880
so so pedro looking from your red

843
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,600
perspective we talked about adversaries

844
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,360
and their um theoretical unlimited time

845
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,679
you are the adversary in this um you

846
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,960
definitely don't have an unlimited time

847
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,159
um

848
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,720
so what is your perspective on that and

849
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,799
i think in general what are the

850
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,960
challenges to organizations or to red

851
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,919
teams

852
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,399
um when designing the ready exercises

853
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,240
because you do have limitations after

854
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,320
all

855
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,440
yeah sure and the limitations are

856
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,320
actually very very important

857
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,039
well that's that's that's a real uh

858
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,480
issue uh

859
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,679
at least for

860
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,399
for small medium-sized companies uh

861
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,519
even for for even larger companies

862
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,000
time is not unlimited and since time is

863
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,799
money money money is also not unlimited

864
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,600
so there's the the issue how much time

865
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,880
and how much money can you invest

866
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,440
in in the red team exercises in a way

867
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
that you can really get the benefits out

868
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,600
of it and

869
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,240
and makes it a valid exercise instead of

870
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,960
just you know putting a check box under

871
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,640
the okay we perform the red team

872
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,840
exercise whatever that means

873
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,399
um

874
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,880
there are several challenges that that

875
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,799
that

876
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,000
you know

877
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,480
red teamers have and also

878
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,840
companies have for example usually some

879
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,000
of the challenges start at the the very

880
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,720
very beginning uh with scope and rules

881
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,559
of engagement uh you know companies uh

882
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,760
want uh and red team exercise and when

883
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,519
they sit down with us and we are trying

884
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,159
to design the exercise figuring out

885
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,080
what's important for them what's the

886
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,000
risk assessment and the threat and the

887
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,240
tech models uh we come up with the the

888
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,279
scope and the rules of engagement and

889
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,000
usually it's kind of uh

890
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,480
like this the red teamers want access

891
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,679
to everything

892
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,320
and the companies go like okay if it's a

893
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,360
production server it's of limits it's uh

894
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,679
the smartphone app is just a better

895
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,279
version and

896
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,679
there's those two or three critical

897
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,399
legacy servers that you cannot touch

898
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,599
and

899
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,918
you know senior staff cannot be social

900
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,280
engineers just you know the the

901
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,560
junior staff so they put this

902
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,960
amount of rules of engagement that are

903
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,800
not really

904
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,480
realistic

905
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,159
from the point of view of a real

906
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,440
attacker and it's our job

907
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,520
as a red teamer as a security person to

908
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,599
properly explain

909
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,599
uh the reasons

910
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,280
and

911
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,719
drive the the customer to

912
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,119
to a point that he understands that

913
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,599
certain things should be tested and of

914
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,040
course we as red teamers also have to

915
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,239
have some flexibility to understand that

916
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,918
there are some systems that are really

917
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,040
critical

918
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,920
and

919
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,160
for in order for them to be touched if

920
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,320
there's no uh test machines uh you

921
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,640
should be really really careful about

922
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,760
doing that

923
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,800
uh

924
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,720
so there's kind of this game that

925
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,560
happens uh

926
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,400
at the very start

927
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,560
then then of course as uh

928
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,680
as a

929
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,280
red teamer there's also uh other types

930
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,480
of challenges uh tanya and and

931
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,920
english talked a lot about persons and

932
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,440
and uh

933
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,839
the importance that that

934
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,520
a person

935
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,240
has in in the security uh

936
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
life cycle of a company which is

937
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,400
paramount uh

938
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,720
so i i would like to bring this this

939
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,480
topic that's quite trending that's uh

940
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,640
headaches uh while doing red team

941
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,359
exercises well for example there's been

942
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,400
some news of phishing campaigns in in

943
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,560
which the context was a i think a salary

944
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,560
bonus or a promotion or whatever and

945
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,920
then uh people on the news reported oh

946
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,599
there's off limits you shouldn't you

947
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,760
know play with the person's employees

948
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,560
feelings and so forth and ethics can be

949
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,599
a real challenge especially in in social

950
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,599
engineering because

951
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,599
you know in a way you are scamming

952
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,640
people

953
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,160
so but

954
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,720
also the entire exercises is a challenge

955
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,200
and the exercise must be valid so if you

956
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,359
think about a phishing campaign as just

957
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,520
you know sending an email to trick users

958
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,320
then yes that's that's a low blow but a

959
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,640
phishing campaign under the the umbrella

960
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,720
of a social engineering campaign is it's

961
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,960
much more than that it should be you

962
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,480
know awareness sessions should be

963
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,640
promoted success metrics should be

964
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,839
analyzed defenses should be evaluated

965
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,920
and this should not never be about the

966
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,320
person or who clicked the malicious link

967
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,760
for example uh it's about how did that

968
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,920
email ended up in the user's mailbox in

969
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,000
the first place what defenses were there

970
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,280
in place

971
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,599
how many users clicked the link how up

972
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,359
to date is your infrastructure how

973
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,960
segmented it is a resistant to attack so

974
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,359
this is not about the person

975
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,119
that clicked the link it's about the

976
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,800
company as a whole

977
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,119
have the has the company you know reduce

978
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,359
training programs or

979
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,520
are is the company you know promoting

980
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,400
the right security mindset uh explaining

981
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,960
and training the their employees

982
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,839
um in the end when something fails it's

983
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,560
always the company fault and it's not

984
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,240
a person's fault

985
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,720
so i believe it's possible to conduct

986
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,040
realistic social engineering campaigns

987
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
you know without making people feel like

988
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,280
crap yes

989
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,680
so the blame issue the blame issue is

990
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,960
always always uh something that is uh on

991
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,520
fire that's a really great segue to a

992
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,280
question that we got from

993
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,839
a ghost e3 or

994
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,240
i'm not sure how to pronounce it ghost

995
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,440
um

996
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,680
this is for tanya so tanya how do you

997
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,359
build bridge

998
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,560
between

999
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,200
dev teams and security compliance teams

1000
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,160
and also i will add my question here of

1001
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,680
how do you look at security compliance

1002
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,359
and versus

1003
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,040
security best practices

1004
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,880
that is a great question

1005
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,400
i would have to say that

1006
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,200
i

1007
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,040
i go over and i talk to them like a

1008
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,960
person

1009
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,280
you would not believe how many apps

1010
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,119
i've joined or security teams that i've

1011
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,280
joined where i said

1012
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,680
oh okay so the decks are doing this did

1013
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,480
you go talk to them and they're like

1014
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,200
well no

1015
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
did you go and have a meeting with them

1016
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,040
do they even know who you are and

1017
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,119
they're like well no like i want the

1018
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,160
dads to all know who we are like they

1019
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,520
might not

1020
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,079
know every member of the aptek team but

1021
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,599
like they should know we exist they

1022
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,520
should know we're here to help and i

1023
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,599
want a bunch of them to know my face and

1024
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,000
i know with covid right now a lot of us

1025
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,160
are not working in person and that is

1026
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,599
totally cool

1027
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,000
um but you know having a zoom meeting

1028
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,920
talking with them on slack or teams or

1029
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,000
discord or whatever you use at work to

1030
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,880
chat

1031
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,359
so i would first start with going over

1032
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,359
like especially if you're starting a new

1033
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,599
job it's kind of easy as an excuse to go

1034
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,680
introduce yourself

1035
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,520
i'll ask can i come to a team meeting

1036
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,200
and like speak like three minutes on

1037
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
like hi i'm tanya i'm new i'm part of

1038
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,160
the apsec team you know here's what i do

1039
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,760
i'm here to help you

1040
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,359
and start like that

1041
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,359
and then when there's a compliance thing

1042
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,440
that i want or there's a thing that i

1043
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,640
want i rate them and i'm like hey i have

1044
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
this thing i have to do

1045
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,240
um i'm wondering if we could meet up and

1046
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,920
chat about how we could do it in the

1047
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,079
least painful way possible

1048
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,720
i also i i have some self-deprecating

1049
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,280
jokes that i will use because sometimes

1050
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,000
i find compliance pain in the butt and i

1051
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,400
don't necessarily love it i also try to

1052
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,040
automate things so it's not as annoying

1053
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,119
and then when the results come out i

1054
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,079
explained so now we negotiate because i

1055
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,920
know they're not going to do all the

1056
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,560
things i need like if you have to follow

1057
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,280
hipaa or gdpr

1058
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,960
or um

1059
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,640
iso 27001 salk2 whatever the thing is

1060
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,200
you can't negotiate on that because you

1061
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,800
must you know if you're handling credit

1062
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,200
cards you must do certain things to be

1063
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,040
pci compliant and i will explain that

1064
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,560
but we might negotiate on when or how or

1065
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,119
who does which work like maybe my team

1066
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,119
can help with some of the things maybe

1067
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,800
we'll get a consultant to help with

1068
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,480
stuff like one of the places where i

1069
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,280
work

1070
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,359
you know we started using a sas tool for

1071
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,200
the first time and we literally found

1072
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,319
like 80 000 bugs because they have lots

1073
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,160
of legacy and they have like hundreds

1074
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,920
and hundreds of apps

1075
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,599
and the devs just

1076
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,599
for obvious reasons we're a little

1077
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,680
uncomfortable and we said listen we're

1078
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,280
going to hire two people for four months

1079
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,000
to triage all of these validate 100 of

1080
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,680
the results for you

1081
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
and then if there's time left they'll

1082
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
even help you fix the bugs but we're

1083
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,079
gonna pay for this to assist you and

1084
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,839
like we don't expect you to validate

1085
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,920
these results that's our responsibility

1086
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,920
but we need you to help us fix those

1087
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,200
bugs and so then we're gonna have

1088
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,119
meetings with them to talk with them

1089
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,520
about okay so you know there's this many

1090
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,400
bugs

1091
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,480
we're worried about that many

1092
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,720
can we plan them out in your upcoming

1093
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,400
releases that you're planning and like

1094
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,119
put them in your schedule and so then

1095
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,880
we're not like

1096
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
essentially

1097
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,000
putting an avalanche of work on them and

1098
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
then walking away

1099
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,720
you know we're working with them and so

1100
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,880
that's how i do it i do a lot of talking

1101
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,319
to them i also do a lot of

1102
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,160
so like i realize that i'm here as a

1103
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,760
speaker at def con so people are like

1104
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,440
you're great at presenting but i'd like

1105
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,160
to note i sucked when i started

1106
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,720
it took a long time to get good at it

1107
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,680
and so

1108
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,560
it

1109
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,960
like anyone listening here like if you

1110
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,880
do lunch and learns and you do little

1111
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,520
presentations even if you're not great

1112
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,079
at it the fact that you're trying people

1113
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,839
will see that and they'll get to know

1114
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,359
you and it sounds weird but it breaks

1115
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,520
down a lot of barriers and so then when

1116
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,760
i go to talk to that team

1117
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
that one dev that went to all the lunch

1118
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,960
and learns or went to some of them it's

1119
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,400
like oh

1120
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,960
hi tanya i'm like hi how's it going and

1121
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,480
it's like you already have an ally on

1122
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,040
that team a person who's like in it with

1123
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,839
you

1124
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,280
and like they'll

1125
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,599
try to help you they don't even realize

1126
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,160
it's just like people love helping and

1127
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,079
if they're going to your presentations

1128
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,079
or they're going to the meetups with you

1129
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,640
or whatever the thing is

1130
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,720
they're they see the value of what

1131
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,119
you're doing and they want to help you

1132
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,319
get there

1133
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,319
and so yeah that's those are my

1134
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,000
suggestions

1135
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,319
there was another question in the tech

1136
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,520
chat

1137
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,760
um that was for me but

1138
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,000
all of the t like all of us could answer

1139
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,319
if you want eras the one

1140
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,000
about um

1141
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,359
implementing

1142
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,359
new security tools

1143
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,400
yeah so

1144
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,359
you mentioned you mentioned the novel

1145
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,599
previous answer i think this is part of

1146
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,200
the avalanche right implementing new

1147
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,720
security tools

1148
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,960
um tons of practices

1149
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
um this is definitely an overload for

1150
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,119
developers many times so how do you keep

1151
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,960
the balance in this part of the

1152
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,440
avalanche

1153
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,480
yeah i i teach them the tool

1154
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,440
i so

1155
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,280
i involve them with proof of concepts if

1156
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,880
they want to come and then when it when

1157
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,680
it comes out i teach them the tool i

1158
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,760
also try to create like little resources

1159
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,599
that go with the tool so for instance

1160
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,359
like one place where i've been doing

1161
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,839
some consulting so we wanted to put

1162
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,240
some tools into their pipelines

1163
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,800
and you know they have the pipe i'm not

1164
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,960
gonna do all of them so what i did was

1165
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,760
is like we did it and tuned it and did

1166
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,079
everything in one pipeline and then we

1167
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,240
shared the yaml with everyone like the

1168
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,400
code and we're like you build the task

1169
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,480
like this you would you know add it here

1170
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,000
this is where it needs to go here is the

1171
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,760
code for it here is this here is that

1172
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,280
and then like made this cute little

1173
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,079
video of us implementing it

1174
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,000
and then turned it all into like an

1175
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
email of how they can do it themselves

1176
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,319
and to ask us if they have problems

1177
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,440
and then

1178
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,599
again like have a meeting with us after

1179
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,119
you run the scanner we'll go over the

1180
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,040
results with you and i realize that this

1181
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,880
doesn't scale very well but lots of

1182
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,160
teams

1183
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,040
you offer they don't accept but knowing

1184
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
that you're there if they get stuck is

1185
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,440
what matters if that makes sense

1186
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,960
and so

1187
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,280
teaching it to them offering as many

1188
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,200
things as you can and also telling them

1189
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,040
what things they have to fix and what

1190
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,800
which things they don't have to

1191
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,319
so for instance if there's like a

1192
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,800
licensing violation it's like whoa we

1193
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,280
don't want to get sued but if you know

1194
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,680
there's high mediums and lows coming

1195
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,200
from you know about some of your

1196
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,720
dependencies

1197
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,560
telling them in advance like listen you

1198
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,319
have to fix all the highs but we can

1199
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,440
negotiate on mediums and lows

1200
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,160
telling them that it makes it less scary

1201
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,560
so try to make it less scary and let

1202
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,160
them know you're there

1203
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,560
i i i totally agree with that i hear a

1204
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,760
lot from

1205
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,920
um people who are

1206
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,760
wondering about if they want to use

1207
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,359
something and ask them what would make

1208
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,359
you use that and and sometimes they say

1209
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,520
the simplest thing like

1210
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,079
if i knew who my focal point was if i

1211
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,920
have any issue with it something like

1212
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,599
that it's it's so easy so so i agree 100

1213
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,040
with me

1214
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,760
we do we do build uh something similar

1215
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,400
like daniel was saying like for example

1216
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,200
we do have currently on the pipelines we

1217
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,119
run assassins uh on the qa in pre-prod

1218
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,200
and then we run dust at the point of

1219
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,240
deployment when you deploy that in

1220
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,839
in in production

1221
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,400
uh and the reports are catered meaning

1222
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,640
the reports that come out of this uh

1223
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,119
secure development lifecycle are catered

1224
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,760
to each team like they the the report

1225
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,520
goes on a monday with the introduced uh

1226
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,079
vulnerabilities or or the path to to

1227
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,960
learn

1228
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,880
on the report of monday and on the

1229
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,040
bottom part of the report

1230
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,680
we curate the best learning resources

1231
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,119
that they can

1232
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,800
get to

1233
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,119
to achieve a mitigation of those types

1234
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,520
of vulnerabilities like for example if a

1235
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,560
team is really good at making queries to

1236
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,760
the database and they do the proper

1237
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,720
sanitization but they are really bad at

1238
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,920
access

1239
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,520
or authorization

1240
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,599
we on the bottom we would have an

1241
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,720
excellent article for for idols and

1242
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,680
explain

1243
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,680
how can they mitigate it from from

1244
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,240
scratch right uh and if that is not

1245
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,960
needed every month we do a

1246
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,480
monthly with all the

1247
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,680
developers

1248
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,640
explaining uh the scores like they have

1249
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,960
actual in a sense of capture the flag

1250
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,400
they have scores of

1251
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,480
how much did you improve over time not

1252
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,319
how much did you get worse because if

1253
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,400
you get worse means that me as a blue

1254
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
team or me as a security individual

1255
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,560
maybe i need to enable them in a more

1256
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,880
secure environment so i need to help

1257
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,960
them to get better not just blame them

1258
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,560
for not having the right patterns of

1259
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,000
behaviors right

1260
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,079
so we catered more to them instead of

1261
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,240
they catering to us and be afraid of

1262
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,560
security

1263
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,359
yeah

1264
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,720
so you had a question for pedals right

1265
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,359
uh i do i mean this is mostly for pedro

1266
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,839
because this is a hot topic for for blue

1267
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,079
teams is better when you're doing a red

1268
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,880
team exercise is it important for you to

1269
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,760
be whitelisted or you prefer to be seen

1270
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,079
as the as the attacker from the outside

1271
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,880
regardless of the the complexity or time

1272
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,520
constraints

1273
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,800
yeah that's also an interesting question

1274
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,280
from the point of view

1275
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,599
that kind of relates with the time slash

1276
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,599
money that the company

1277
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,319
is willing to invest

1278
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,160
for me ideally

1279
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,640
i see a red team exercise more like a

1280
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,520
black box as exercise it can be kind of

1281
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,599
gray box exercise but never never

1282
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,319
white box and i say this because

1283
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,480
uh we need to understand the different

1284
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,760
uh

1285
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,000
the differences between a vulnerability

1286
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,400
assessment that's one thing the

1287
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,160
penetration testing that's that's

1288
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,920
another thing and then there's red

1289
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,960
teaming

1290
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,760
uh red teaming by definition should have

1291
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,160
more time uh

1292
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,119
at least

1293
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,280
more stretched in time you don't you

1294
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,440
don't have to be permanently attacking

1295
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,359
the the organization that you're trying

1296
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,240
to

1297
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,680
to to enter

1298
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,480
but

1299
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,800
you need enough time to be creative to

1300
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,319
to figure out new

1301
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,960
you know maybe new attack vectors

1302
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,880
depending on the rules of engagement

1303
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,440
even a physical presence

1304
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,559
might be

1305
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,000
allowed and those are the the fun ones

1306
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,640
where you can actually go into the

1307
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,880
into the facilities of a company and you

1308
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,400
know drop an implant and so forth so

1309
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,359
yeah

1310
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,359
i agree i agree

1311
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,640
i agree i mean mine is mostly my my

1312
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,559
question is mostly from the fact that

1313
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,240
when we are doing the the blue team

1314
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,680
preparation for

1315
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,720
i even prefer not to know when

1316
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,880
i prefer not to advise teams when they

1317
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,800
are about to get a red team assessment

1318
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,720
just to verify the incident procedures

1319
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,520
and all of the security layers that we

1320
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,440
sell so much to the board they should be

1321
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,240
able to sustain a non uh it's not like

1322
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,319
hackers are gonna call your company and

1323
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,800
gonna be like hey uh we're gonna breach

1324
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,839
you in seven days so be ready it's like

1325
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,240
they they are there all the time right

1326
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,200
yeah yeah

1327
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,160
so that's why whitelist for me is a hard

1328
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,839
time

1329
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,040
if you're doing just straight

1330
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,200
penetration testing i think whitelist is

1331
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,079
a is a plus i think it should be in sync

1332
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,040
with the with the blue team uh

1333
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,839
uh you can actually test a lot much more

1334
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,920
stuff you can have a

1335
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,800
a better vision of what the company does

1336
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,760
and

1337
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,119
which assets the the company has and and

1338
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,160
it's also okay to to to test the blue

1339
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:10,960
team

1340
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,760
and

1341
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,680
you should be working this together

1342
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,680
maybe not completely

1343
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,520
as we are used to uh

1344
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,440
with the definition that we have we have

1345
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,160
now

1346
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,480
as a as a purple team but definitely

1347
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,359
working together and

1348
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,720
and maybe tanya can explain how can we

1349
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,640
fit in a purple team

1350
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,960
uh after the exercise or during the

1351
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,040
exercise if it's uh

1352
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,640
if it's a

1353
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,359
white box kind of pen testing and how

1354
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,760
how can we fit in the purple team when

1355
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,000
there's a red team exercise that is not

1356
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,400
by definition supposed to be coordinated

1357
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,440
with with the blue team

1358
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,200
i feel like

1359
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,800
i just want to give a heads up that

1360
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,200
we're approaching the end of our time so

1361
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,680
please all of you uh deal panelists keep

1362
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,440
your answers

1363
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,160
short and sweet

1364
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,240
awesome

1365
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,880
i

1366
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,040
i feel like security

1367
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,720
is really really really good at keeping

1368
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,920
secrets

1369
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,000
and as an industry

1370
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,240
like at like the security professionals

1371
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,640
like boots on ground we kind of suck at

1372
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,760
marketing

1373
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,599
and if we could learn to share more

1374
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,599
information like for instance you know

1375
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,040
the red team doesn't want to tell

1376
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,040
everyone they're coming but having

1377
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,880
presentations after

1378
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,640
letting devs come

1379
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,640
so like quite often like we just don't

1380
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,520
include the devs we just don't include

1381
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,079
um like the devops team the operations

1382
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,440
folks

1383
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,160
in these presentations if we could

1384
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,720
share more like i was super nervous when

1385
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,720
i started doing it i was worried that

1386
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,319
all of them would think i was stupid to

1387
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,640
be honest like tanya screwed this up

1388
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,800
like there was a security incident she

1389
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,680
sucks that a security incident happened

1390
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,599
but they didn't turned out they're

1391
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,680
really interested they learned and they

1392
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,800
did better

1393
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,200
and so maybe what we need to do is start

1394
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,599
figuring out more ways that safely we

1395
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,040
can share when possible

1396
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,119
awesome anyone else

1397
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,359
a very quick question

1398
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,200
for our blue luis

1399
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,880
you talked about

1400
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,400
artificial intelligence you talked about

1401
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
machine learning tooling

1402
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,599
aren't you

1403
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,599
killing your own team um kind of

1404
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,760
automating your role and cutting the

1405
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,559
branch you're sitting on

1406
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,000
um

1407
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,160
now they hate doing uh the part that

1408
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,160
they are doing today right so

1409
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,079
they are always uh

1410
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,480
trying to get outside of of the hamster

1411
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,280
wheel

1412
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,599
that they live looking at uh

1413
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,720
known patterns or imagine so today

1414
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,599
uh something like heartbleed 2 comes out

1415
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,760
oh my god let's let's look to the logs

1416
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,520
did we get attack

1417
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,400
before this is this pattern known

1418
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,440
they they hate that side of living on

1419
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,839
the path right they normally live either

1420
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,480
on the past or they live on the present

1421
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,720
with afraid of the future

1422
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,440
um what i try to pass for them is can

1423
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,800
you imagine the freedom that is you

1424
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,640
looking so far to the future that you

1425
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,200
are predicting all your threat scenarios

1426
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,160
and building uh the the positive layers

1427
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,160
of of security on top of it with the

1428
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,760
developers with the infrastructure

1429
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,000
experts with guys like pedro trying to

1430
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,400
test us with people like tanya teaching

1431
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,800
us how to build the process in a more uh

1432
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,000
humane way right that is what we need to

1433
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,319
do like if we are afraid of machine

1434
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,319
learning or ai

1435
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,680
why are you here do you want to do

1436
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,599
repetitive work there is

1437
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,520
there is no um

1438
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,359
no end game for that because at some

1439
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,319
point like pedro said that money will

1440
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,400
will come in and say look why am i

1441
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,119
paying seven eight nine ten senior stock

1442
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,480
analysts

1443
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,400
and threat intelligence and whatever

1444
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,040
when i can have a tool that does this

1445
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,720
and and cut the cost by 80

1446
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,240
and that's where the humans go in and

1447
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,559
say wait a minute i like to buy the tool

1448
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,359
but i want to customize it and put my my

1449
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:12,559
my top

1450
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,040
expertise on on that so we can be ahead

1451
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,440
instead of behind of the attackers that

1452
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,359
is for me a win-win situation for a

1453
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,599
cool sounds good

1454
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,599
okay the last question

1455
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,079
tanya for you let's make it quick

1456
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,520
although i read the question i don't

1457
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,920
think we can how do companies culturally

1458
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,079
make the shift from red

1459
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,359
versus blue to purple

1460
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,760
i think it has to do with training

1461
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,839
and i think that if it comes from the

1462
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,680
top that's the best

1463
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,319
but if you can hire that one person with

1464
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,559
that infectious personality

1465
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,040
where they are so excited about security

1466
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,520
and they're open to sharing

1467
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,079
and then encouraging it so it might be a

1468
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,799
consultant it might be that you need to

1469
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,040
add a new security person to your team

1470
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,799
it could be that you send the managers

1471
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,040
on training and they come back

1472
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,880
i mean like

1473
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,400
obviously i'm going to tell you like buy

1474
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,680
my book because it's going to tell you

1475
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,839
all the stuff i've had a lot of people

1476
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,920
say like you teach absec in this really

1477
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,480
soft way but i do it because that's what

1478
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,319
actually works

1479
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,640
and if you send someone into a knapsack

1480
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,040
job and they don't know that you have to

1481
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,799
compromise you have to negotiate you

1482
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,760
have to persuade like half of your job

1483
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,240
every day is convincing devs and

1484
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,240
management and the rest of the security

1485
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,480
team to go along with your plan and meet

1486
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,680
in the middle

1487
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,359
and so yeah

1488
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,520
i i believe that you kind of have to

1489
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,839
build that skill set and people some

1490
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,079
people poo poo soft skills but i don't

1491
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,680
think you can get far without them in

1492
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,240
apsec

1493
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,520
yeah

1494
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,200
okay and we are the end of the hour uh

1495
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,440
actually one minute beyond thank you so
