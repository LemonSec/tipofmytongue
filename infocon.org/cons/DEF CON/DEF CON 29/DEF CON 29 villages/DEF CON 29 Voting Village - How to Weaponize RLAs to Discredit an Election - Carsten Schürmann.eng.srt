1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,840
to speak uh at this year's defcon

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,920
voting village i'm going to talk about

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,919
how to weaponize rlas to discredit an

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,800
election

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,120
my name is carson sherman i'm actually

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,480
working in copenhagen

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,240
at the center for information security

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,000
and trust and some of the results i'm

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,680
going to talk about today

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,080
actually based on joint work with asmita

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,039
delela

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,320
and oksana kuduk so

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,439
let's just dive right in a risk living

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,480
mallet you probably have heard already

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,440
in the past talks that uh you know

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
resuming audits what they are and so on

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,559
let me just kind of

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,960
recapitulate and summarize what they are

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,120
so resuming audits are a statistically

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,960
sound auditing method so there's no

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,840
question about it

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,680
and you know i think it's really

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,280
important to emphasize

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
that it is a sound method it's

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,559
statistically

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,760
proven correct many people in the world

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,399
have

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,399
looked at the mass behind it they all

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,399
agree that this the mass

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,440
the mass of testing is right and

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,560
so there is in this talk i am not going

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,159
to

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,280
put in question if resuming audits are

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,000
sound or not

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,119
i'm just saying um they are sound

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,680
and the idea of the wristling audit is

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,439
of course to identify

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,680
and automatically correct an erroneous

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,720
election result

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,159
and i have here actually made a little

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,880
drawing of

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,439
how wristling audits actually work um

43
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,439
you basically have paper ballots there's

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,720
a paper

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
ballot manifest which tells you how

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
the um ballots are stored where you can

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,759
find paper ballots and so on and then

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,000
there

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
is of course the result

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,880
here's my laser pointer so here's the

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,720
result and when you start a risk

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,680
limiting audit

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,399
you first need to kind of compute the

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
sample size and the way how you do it is

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,399
you take the results you know depending

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,479
on what kind of a system you have

57
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,360
you look for the margins um you have to

58
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
determine what kind of list

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
risk limit you want that means how

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
confident do you want to be that

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,160
a erroneous election result was actually

62
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
being caught and corrected

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,000
and once you have that you have computed

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
a sample size now you have to draw

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,239
a random sample of the ballots and for

66
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,160
that you need the ballot manifest

67
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
and you need to enter some kind of

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,440
entropy to make it

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,480
truly random because a restaurant audit

70
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,239
that doesn't draw a random sample is

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,920
actually not a very good

72
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,040
audit so once you know which ballots you

73
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,080
want to draw

74
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,640
you actually then can start going to the

75
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
ballot box and do the real audit you

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
basically follow the information um of

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,480
the sample which tells you you know go

78
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,360
to this

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,080
thing and check out this ballot and do

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,599
whatever you have to do with it

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,040
and then once you have done the audit

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,720
and the outcome is like yes

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,959
i found enough correct uh statistical

84
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,720
evidence to kind of support

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,239
the claim that the election result is

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,239
correct or i i didn't

87
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,400
in which case i have to go back go to a

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,159
bigger sample in the first case

89
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,280
we'll have to do a full uh recount so

90
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,440
this is the idea of a risk living audits

91
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
and we all know that risk limiting

92
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,879
orders come in many many different

93
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,360
flavors

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,280
flavors there's the pop a belt pulling

95
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
audit which is in order

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
where we are going to draw a sample and

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,519
trying to kind of

98
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
find support statistical support for the

99
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,760
correctness of this election result

100
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,319
or we do a ballot level comparison audit

101
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,920
where we for example check

102
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
that the ballot is actually correctly

103
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,519
registered on the

104
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,239
cast vote record the cvr record so there

105
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,599
are many different ways

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
and the reason why i'm actually saying

107
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,959
this is because

108
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,239
in this talk i'm actually going to focus

109
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,040
mostly on

110
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,480
ballot level comparison audits because

111
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,959
there was the easiest and that also

112
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
scales up to other countries beyond the

113
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,319
united states because

114
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,000
i believe that the findings are actually

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
kind of important not just for the

116
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,040
united states but also for other

117
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
countries

118
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,680
so now if we do a ballot level

119
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
comparison audit let's just look

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,040
at one example here is the result

121
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,560
of the colorado 2016 election

122
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,720
and i'm displaying you show your picture

123
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
here of philip stark's tools that

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,440
actually

125
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,120
uh computes the uh the the size

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
of the sample and so how does it

127
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,880
actually go about doing this

128
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,759
yes so you um basically take that tool

129
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,280
which is available from philip

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,080
stark's homepage you type in the numbers

131
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,840
and then at the end

132
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,560
you um just press return you also kind

133
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,199
of

134
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,040
choose the risk limit which is here 95

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,280
percent but the risk is 5

136
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,680
and so you get 95 confidence that the

137
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,199
election result is correct and

138
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,360
you do something with these overvotes uh

139
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
overstatements and understatements

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
um uh no worry about that but once you

141
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
hit calculate size

142
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
it actually kind of comes up here as a

143
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,199
result and the result is 142 ballots

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,000
okay so i have given this talk and

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,479
showed the slide many times in the past

146
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,759
and what my experience is

147
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,240
that people especially election

148
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,919
officials they're really excited about

149
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,039
the audit

150
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,639
data risk living audit but when they

151
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
hear the number 142

152
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
they say like oh yeah how can that be

153
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,720
true this cannot possibly be true

154
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,360
that's just not uh that's just not that

155
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,000
doesn't sound

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,160
right only 142 votes you have to

157
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
look at in order to be 95 sure that the

158
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,199
the election result of the presidential

159
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,840
election 2016 the collateral result

160
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,960
is actually correct um

161
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
yeah so because i've given this talk so

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,400
much

163
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
and i've seen the faces of the audience

164
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,000
it got me thinking

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,759
it's like you know with receiving audits

166
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,199
what we want to do is we want to make

167
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,560
sure we want to provide

168
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,240
some form of evidence and check that the

169
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,919
election result is correct

170
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,840
not necessarily recounting the whole

171
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,160
thing but just do it in a statistically

172
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
relevant way okay

173
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,639
but if the number is so small can that

174
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:02,960
be

175
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
misused in one way or the other and

176
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
therefore

177
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
i actually came up with this this

178
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,639
research question just like

179
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
can one weaponize rlas to discredit an

180
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,639
election

181
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,639
and it has always puzzled me that um

182
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,199
the face of the people in the audience

183
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,639
when i talk about this and

184
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,880
and so what i want to show you in this

185
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,759
talk is

186
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,360
i want to show you that i believe that

187
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
this is actually possible

188
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,000
and in order to convince you about this

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,479
i

190
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,560
structured this talk in five different

191
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
easy to follow steps i hope

192
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
the first one is um i'm going to talk

193
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,560
about the disinformation

194
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,160
playbook and that's really a

195
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,520
study of a group of

196
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
scientists concerned scientists they

197
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,120
came up this uh

198
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,599
you know different place how companies

199
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,280
actually in the health sector

200
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,880
are um you know using or misusing

201
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,360
information to construct disinformation

202
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,599
campaigns that are actually helping

203
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,639
their cause then second step i'm going

204
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,720
to identify vulnerable assumptions in

205
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,199
the

206
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,479
rla and one is of particular interest

207
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,960
and that is that of the sample size then

208
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
we're going to conduct or describe to

209
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,440
you a

210
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,199
you the results of a user study that we

211
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,800
have recently conducted in the united

212
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,919
states

213
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,120
and then i try to argue that with that

214
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,800
information at hand you actually can

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,960
design a disinformation campaign

216
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
where people when they listen to it and

217
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,039
are easily made to believe things that

218
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,360
are

219
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,599
not right one can kind of change their

220
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,080
one most likely i should say can change

221
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
their perception

222
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,240
of that and lastly i would like to talk

223
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,120
about

224
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,319
a few defense mechanisms that i think

225
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,919
are mostly informal and some

226
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,039
are more useful than others but i think

227
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,840
there's some

228
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,639
more research to be done okay so let's

229
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,280
look at the

230
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,919
disinformation table so this information

231
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,680
playbook as i already mentioned

232
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,520
um is was published in 2017 by

233
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,240
the union of concerned scientists now is

234
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
that a good reference well i don't know

235
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,720
but

236
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
it actually kind of when i read these

237
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
five points um

238
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,599
it made a lot of sense to me i'm not

239
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,039
sure if these are the

240
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,960
the that's a complete list of things

241
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,479
that one can do um

242
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,840
in order to define or if it classifies

243
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,919
all possible ways to organize a

244
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,479
disinformation campaign but i think they

245
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,599
are definitely

246
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,640
uh valid and useful so let me just kind

247
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,599
of review them

248
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,839
there's the fake play of that is that's

249
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,200
what that's always this

250
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,440
in front of it but you do counterfeit

251
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
science and try to pass off legit

252
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,839
legitimate research so you know here for

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,959
the rlas

254
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,160
it could be uh you know

255
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
making some other statistics which is

256
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,279
obviously wrong and say like you know

257
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,720
see this is how you should do and not

258
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,519
like the ones

259
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,839
how the relays are really conducted the

260
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
blitzes you harass the scientists to

261
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
speak out with the results and

262
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
inconvenient views um i think the

263
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
community around all this has become so

264
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,000
big

265
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,360
that this is actually not really a

266
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
concern but nevertheless it's one of the

267
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,760
place

268
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
in the disinformation playbook the

269
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
diversion technique

270
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
is your manufacturer uncertainty about

271
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
science where it is possible

272
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
so i think the diversion is actually

273
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,519
where you leave the science and the

274
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,240
results

275
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,640
intact but you manufacture certain kind

276
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
of arguments and

277
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,560
collect evidence that can show

278
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,519
where you misuse the signs and you argue

279
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,480
exactly the con

280
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
contrary so that this diversion play is

281
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,560
the one that

282
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,399
will keep us busy and we'll return to it

283
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,000
at the end of this talk

284
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
then there's the screenplay you buy

285
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,480
credibility so alliances with academic

286
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,720
and

287
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
professional societies to make it look

288
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,000
okay

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,279
so i cannot talk about anyone else but

290
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,959
you know i've never been approached

291
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,200
on any of those issues and then there's

292
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,640
the fix you manipulate government

293
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,399
officials or processes to influence

294
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,519
policy

295
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,920
um that kind of is also somewhat

296
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,720
relevant

297
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
here but we will see it's not the main

298
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,399
focus of this talk but the main focus is

299
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,160
the diversion

300
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,320
so that's the disinformation playbook

301
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
when i say like

302
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
um you know you do it i'm talking about

303
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,360
some kind of an disinformation architect

304
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,720
an adversary who is trying to kind of

305
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
influence public opinion in a particular

306
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,720
way and try to sway it either

307
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
this direction or the other so the

308
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,760
question therefore is

309
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,600
who are the disinformation architects

310
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,200
that might have an interest

311
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
in order to do something about fiscal

312
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
limiting audits

313
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
and i think they are there we have to

314
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,160
distinguish two levels namely the global

315
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,360
level and which

316
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
are nation states who are interested in

317
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
meddling with one's election

318
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
and there's of course the local level

319
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,079
which actually is

320
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,440
not to be neglected where there are

321
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
activists and political parties

322
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
that try to argue and uh and uh um

323
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,519
argue their way want to uh you know

324
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,640
discredit and

325
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
risk them ignored it in one way or the

326
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
other okay

327
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
so uh you know the local level i think

328
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,600
is like

329
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,519
when we talk about election security in

330
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,720
the general

331
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
space i think the local level is

332
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,399
particularly worrisome because

333
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,160
it actually takes only very very few

334
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,079
people to influence

335
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,839
public opinion and here we have a um

336
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,279
on the right you see a newspaper

337
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,519
clipping a majority of coveted

338
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,959
misinformations comes from only

339
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,480
12 people so that's a very recent

340
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
that's a very recent observation

341
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,760
maybe one or two weeks ago okay so this

342
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,959
is what i wanted to say about the

343
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,200
disinformation play

344
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
playbook let's move on and talk about

345
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,440
identifiable vulnerable assumptions in

346
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
risk limiting audits

347
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,399
and i would like to kind of point out

348
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,000
three okay

349
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,760
so there's the first assumption that we

350
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,519
make that is that the integrity and the

351
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,880
security of the paper trail

352
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,079
is intact for noted so that means that

353
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,720
after

354
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
ballots are cast on election day and

355
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
before the audit

356
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,320
is commenced it's usually you know a few

357
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,880
days a few weeks that pass in the middle

358
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,800
now in between we need to kind of make

359
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,120
sure that the paper trail is secure

360
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
okay and so we assume that the security

361
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,160
mechanisms

362
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
that are put in place actually are

363
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
sufficient

364
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
another part of this assumption is also

365
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
you know you also have to

366
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,240
to kind of assume that the risk limit of

367
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
95

368
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
is acceptable for the people i mean if

369
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,399
it's too too little

370
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,440
um if they say like well five percent uh

371
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,279
risk it's it's not unacceptable for us

372
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,959
we need to be 99.9

373
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,839
sure sure um you can do it but when you

374
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,240
do an audit you have to deter

375
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,399
define the risk limit before you start

376
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,920
the audit

377
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,480
assumption number two yeah it's the the

378
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
sample size

379
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,480
that you actually compute so the number

380
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
that comes out of those things as i

381
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
mentioned earlier can be very very small

382
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,079
142 for a

383
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,600
ballot level comparison audit in

384
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
colorado um

385
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
not a very big size and so the question

386
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,959
is like do people believe it

387
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,240
do they accept it or could you maybe

388
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,120
influence them to kind of uh think about

389
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,639
this in another way

390
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,200
and the third assumption is at the end

391
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
is that the sample is actually drawn at

392
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,000
random and not

393
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,079
you know staged and said like you know

394
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,000
here look i pick my 142

395
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
ballots they support everything but you

396
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
have already pre-computed exactly

397
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,839
and sorted them in such a way that the

398
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,360
142 ballots

399
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
are actually exactly there to support

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,480
your your claim so

401
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,800
this is why the statistical sample has

402
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,639
to be statistics now for this

403
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,760
talk i'm only concentrating on if the

404
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,279
number of ballots to be sampled is

405
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,320
trustworthy

406
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,800
okay so that's uh that's the the thing

407
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,000
that we want to study

408
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,399
and uh for that we actually made a user

409
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,040
study

410
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
so we made a user study and we went out

411
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,199
and we used a particular

412
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,680
platform the prolific platform which is

413
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,519
used by many social scientists for doing

414
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,800
studies like this

415
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,480
and we just asked people okay so

416
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,639
what what do you think about risk

417
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,760
feminine audits

418
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,920
uh would you accept that result and so

419
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,199
on and below here

420
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,920
you see an example so uh so number one

421
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,399
is

422
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,320
the uh participants that we chose

423
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
they're all u.s citizens and the

424
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,399
prolific platform it's a crowdsourced

425
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,279
platform

426
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,639
you can just kind of click you know

427
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,160
where do you want the participants to be

428
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,880
from

429
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,519
and because we made the study right in

430
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,880
the aftermath of the

431
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800
2020 election we thought like oh that's

432
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,399
that seems to be a good

433
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,240
thing so let's just ask those people who

434
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,399
have maybe read something about resuming

435
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:32,959
audits

436
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,199
in the newspaper especially in georgia

437
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,680
but we just kind of picked

438
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,399
any kind of demographic um among all of

439
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,760
the united states citizens that are

440
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
registered on the prolific platform and

441
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,800
then our

442
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,240
um our

443
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
user questionnaire looked a little bit

444
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,839
like this

445
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,560
we basically made a fake election which

446
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
has about three million votes cost

447
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,279
okay and then we also for every

448
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,399
participant

449
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,800
we changed and and you know modified

450
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,440
slightly

451
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,959
the margin between the two currently

452
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,639
that so it's a it's always an election

453
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,160
with two candidates there's candidate a

454
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,959
and candidate

455
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,079
b and uh you know here

456
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,519
is um okay here

457
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,199
and then you you the um the

458
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,440
participant has to answer to certain

459
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,240
questions so

460
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
one of these questions would be if the

461
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,839
candidates support loss in the election

462
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,279
in the initial so do you think an audit

463
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,040
would be a good option to reconfirm the

464
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,399
election result

465
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,000
and yes no maybe and so on so we kind of

466
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,279
wrote out um the we kind of introduced

467
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,600
the risk limiting audits just with a few

468
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,199
words the beginning of the

469
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,600
study so if the participant read this

470
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,680
stuff carefully that we presented

471
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,560
should understand uh basically what is a

472
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,759
risk limit audit

473
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,639
but at the same level of detail as i've

474
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,480
tried to explain it to you here in this

475
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
talk

476
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,240
okay so now what were our findings

477
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
so the first one is i call the law of

478
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,320
the untrusted small numbers

479
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,079
and so we had actually two hypotheses

480
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,560
that we wanted to confirm or

481
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,320
yeah that we plan to confirm and both

482
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,680
were actually confirmed and i'll show

483
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,120
you the

484
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,519
some graphs on the next slide so here's

485
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,839
uh hypothesis 1.1

486
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,920
when asked about their opinions about

487
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,040
which number of ballots should be

488
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,480
selected for ordering the participants

489
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
provide a number higher

490
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,759
than the one prescribed by the rla

491
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,759
methodology

492
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,759
and you know here the methodology is as

493
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,839
i said a ballot

494
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,199
level comparison audit the hypothesis

495
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,160
1.2

496
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,680
is that the participant's confidence in

497
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,519
the order results changes when they are

498
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,120
actually informed about the number of

499
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,560
ballots selected for audi

500
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,800
auditing and both of those things

501
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,279
are are what we could confirm and let me

502
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,000
show you

503
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,120
the graphs okay so here are two graphs

504
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,920
the first graph basically here on the

505
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,040
left

506
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
it shows you it's a logarithmic scale as

507
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
you can see

508
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,720
between 0.01 all the way to ten percent

509
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
this would be a hundred percent on the

510
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,240
very top okay so the

511
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,559
top line is like all of the people who

512
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,400
wanted to kind of have a full recount

513
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,599
anyway and here at the very bottom

514
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,959
zero these are all of the people who uh

515
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,000
didn't want to have a uh you know didn't

516
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,039
want to have a recount

517
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,480
at all or wrist them in an audit at all

518
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
and here these red points so these

519
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,679
orange looking points

520
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,520
these are basically for each one of the

521
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,120
questionnaire we generated a different

522
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,760
number

523
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
and you can see they were uniformly

524
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,760
distributed which in retrospect wasn't

525
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,919
that a clever idea because

526
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,260
here they're very very few uh

527
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,320
[Music]

528
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,280
very very few dots in the middle because

529
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,440
when it goes to uh you know

530
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,799
it's just because the thing gets so

531
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,640
incredibly um

532
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,760
you know it grows very very quickly

533
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,799
so yes you can see here

534
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,760
almost everyone wanted to have a number

535
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,520
felt comfortable with a number

536
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,799
uh above and only a very few set of

537
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,880
people a group of people actually wanted

538
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,919
less

539
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,080
um so we could confirm you know doing

540
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,160
all the statistics and analysis and the

541
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,280
testing and so on

542
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,400
we could confirm the hypothesis number

543
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,200
one

544
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,160
indeed that people wanted to have a

545
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
higher number

546
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
but this is not the interesting part i

547
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
think the interesting part is really

548
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,799
the second graph here that you see on

549
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,200
the line are people changing their minds

550
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,880
when they actually learn

551
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,919
about what is the number chosen okay

552
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,160
and so here you see these two axes

553
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,679
there's the before axis and these the

554
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,640
after axis

555
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
so before many people were actually kind

556
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
of happy and okay with that

557
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,160
but if you tell them what the number is

558
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,320
suddenly people were not definitely yes

559
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
was off the table

560
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,960
they were very surprised that these

561
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,360
numbers were so small and they didn't

562
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,799
think that this actually kind of it

563
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,799
didn't kind of grow any confidence

564
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,840
in our sample and again we

565
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,679
we did the statistics we did the

566
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
analysis and we could confirm the

567
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
hypothesis

568
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,400
okay so uh this was uh you know this was

569
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,679
the uh the first

570
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,360
you know the first two hypothesis or the

571
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
first hypothesis two sub-hypothesis

572
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
and we also had second hypothesis the

573
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,679
second hypothesis is

574
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,280
how about the justification for the

575
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,200
sample size okay

576
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,559
so is that you know the the sample size

577
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,320
comes out of a tool

578
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
and the question is is there a

579
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,679
difference in the effects on the voter's

580
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,280
confidence in audits depending on which

581
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,039
selection criteria backs up the chosen

582
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,960
number of the audited balance

583
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
and so what we've actually thought we

584
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
kind of asked you know

585
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,240
hear different uh um different

586
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,160
basically sources yes so there's the

587
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
peer-reviewed scientific paper that

588
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,320
tells you how big the sources

589
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,440
and independent experts so

590
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,200
not the experts that were um tried to be

591
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,720
bought in the disinformation and cook

592
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,960
so but really independent honest to god

593
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,559
you know honest people

594
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,799
an agreement among political parties our

595
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,760
political parties

596
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,320
do they agree and uh so that we have

597
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,080
mandated by court the court says

598
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,919
you know so and so many ballots have to

599
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,200
be audited

600
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,120
non-governmental organizations could

601
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,600
also um enter the ngos could also enter

602
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,799
the picture and to give

603
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,840
give some some suggestions of uh how big

604
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,000
the numbers on just general legislation

605
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,480
so

606
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,080
what we actually found out is yes

607
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,360
so uh so here the peer review paper

608
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,520
most of the participants really trust

609
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,080
the academic

610
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,120
the academic performance and

611
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,480
very many many fewer

612
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,679
actually the legislation so again we did

613
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,280
some statistic analysis

614
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,840
and we could confirm um this this

615
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
hypothesis

616
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,120
okay so now we move on to um

617
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
the limitations of the user study okay

618
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,120
so this was a quantitative research

619
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,679
study

620
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,799
of course one could have done a

621
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,880
qualitative research study as well which

622
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,600
being part did but i'm leaving this out

623
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,080
out of this

624
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,679
out of this presentation and there is a

625
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,400
paper

626
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
where we describe all of this which

627
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,600
shortly

628
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,640
appears on archive x and has been also

629
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,200
accepted in you know at the e-vote id

630
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
conference

631
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,559
in bregenz uh in austria

632
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,080
this year so what else is there there we

633
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
have to kind of make the the standard

634
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,280
bias disclaimers okay

635
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,799
although many social scientists are

636
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,400
using crowdsourcing platforms

637
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,200
uh like it's like prolific to do their

638
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,760
studies

639
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,600
there's an inherent bias that might come

640
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,360
with that namely that only people with

641
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,720
internet access actually kind of

642
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,919
participate in this

643
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,840
more wealthy mobile educated people and

644
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,000
that you know the same kind of comment

645
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,440
and concern

646
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,799
that you might have about the other

647
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,520
studies also i see no question about it

648
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,919
so the third point is the limitations we

649
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,280
have thought about

650
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,080
ballot polling audits and we have not

651
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,600
looked so much into ballot polling

652
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,159
audits

653
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,080
but more in comparison audits and the

654
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,200
reason for that is

655
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
because the study was actually meant to

656
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,400
be more global

657
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,159
we did not just focus on the united

658
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,840
states but we've

659
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,200
also wanted to kind of look at other

660
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,520
countries for example kenya

661
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,080
sub-saharan continent um you know can

662
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,960
you actually use

663
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,760
wrestling audits in order to instill

664
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,799
trust

665
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,840
more trust in these kind of countries

666
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,799
so um so this is why we have not done

667
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,600
actually

668
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,400
um and our questions did not aim to kind

669
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,799
of

670
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,280
validate the choices that the valid

671
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,720
polling audit would give

672
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
but only the comparison audits so we

673
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,799
also did not

674
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,600
ask for any prior questions regarding

675
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,919
prior knowledge on rlas

676
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,360
we just kind of asked

677
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
the people you know here listen to this

678
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
these are the numbers do you trust it or

679
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,159
not

680
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,679
yes okay so moving on

681
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,360
to how do you design a disinformation

682
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,720
campaign out of us

683
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,000
okay and uh we only do this with the

684
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,840
law of the untrusted number so the first

685
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,000
thing i would like to kind of point out

686
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,640
here

687
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,760
is that uh there is actually

688
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,559
no disinform or i could not identify any

689
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,440
in

690
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,400
this information using my humble google

691
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,039
searching

692
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,559
skills okay so i just looked for

693
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,600
um on google as like georgia

694
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
you know which actually used the risk of

695
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
being ordered in the 2020

696
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
election said like you know what about

697
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,799
georgia georgia risk the main audit

698
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,000
and so i went to this this list of

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,480
the list of papers here i've been to fox

700
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,159
news i went to cnn i

701
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,320
tried to cover all of the different

702
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,480
media and all of the media reported on

703
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,679
the wrestling audit

704
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,760
but they all did it in actually very

705
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
professional neutral and technical way

706
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,720
so it was almost like you know there was

707
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,960
the only opinion i could actually

708
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,799
uh see in some of these articles were

709
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,320
like oh always

710
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,000
relays are good but you know it's

711
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,760
essentially they're just recons recons

712
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,720
are always better

713
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,760
our laser i'm just you do an rla

714
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,240
if you want to uh you know speed up and

715
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
save costs

716
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,279
and don't have to look to add so many

717
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,360
ballots so that's the only opinion so

718
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,520
it does not appear to me that anyone

719
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
actually tried to kind of make a

720
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
disinformation campaign

721
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,200
out of this uh law of small

722
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,240
numbers that we we identified to bizarre

723
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,679
with our user study okay so now

724
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,520
you have probably already guessed it the

725
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,200
diversion disinformation plan would be

726
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,080
very very simple

727
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,640
you're just making a subs an

728
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,440
unsubstantiated claim that the sample

729
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,880
size is too small

730
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,559
and many people will say like oh my

731
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,720
goodness yes the sample size is too

732
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
small

733
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,279
and that would be the cause of

734
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,799
you know people actually trust that you

735
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,320
know changing their mind about

736
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,000
should you trust the election result or

737
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,559
should you not trust the election result

738
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,000
and then once you make that claim now

739
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,640
you have to kind of find a sample a

740
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,840
a way to kind of distribute that

741
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,279
information across

742
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,799
the network and you can either go to

743
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,799
your favorite news outlet or you can do

744
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
social media or you can do whatever the

745
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,799
12 people did or 17 people

746
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,480
who spread all of the disinformation

747
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,200
about corporate vaccines

748
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,720
it's not that i don't think it's

749
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
terribly difficult i think it can be

750
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,640
done and i think it's actually uh

751
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
uh quite problematic and if something

752
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
like this might happen and it's it's i

753
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,039
think it's

754
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,279
it's it could be you know maybe one of

755
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,120
the conclusions of the talk is

756
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,159
um shall we just uh you know maybe think

757
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,039
about

758
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,240
um first of all what you know

759
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,679
what can we do in order to mitigate

760
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,679
the the impact of such a

761
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,039
diversion disinformation play

762
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,919
and i think but we come to to these

763
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,440
mitigations

764
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,720
in a little while okay

765
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
so the analysis that we've conducted

766
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,279
very preliminary here

767
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,640
is that such a disinformation

768
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,559
campaign would probably work best when

769
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,760
the margins

770
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,919
are wide because margins are wide

771
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,559
sample sizes are low sample sizes are

772
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,279
low

773
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,840
people don't trust it and you have a

774
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
problem so that's actually

775
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,760
an observation which is which is uh

776
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,960
somewhat comforting

777
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
also when the when the um sample size is

778
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,279
too small it will

779
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,080
the our label trigger a full recount you

780
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,279
know then

781
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,200
it's also um a uh

782
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,080
a technique or you know it's it will

783
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,440
strengthen

784
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,679
if it's a full hand recount there's no

785
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,440
it's basically a recount it's no longer

786
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:45,679
an

787
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,159
rla and it will probably not affect uh

788
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,000
the trust

789
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,120
the things you know so the uh um

790
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,080
the smaller the margins um or the larger

791
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,200
the margins

792
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,720
um the more the higher the risk

793
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,679
that uh such a disinformation uh play

794
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,840
would actually be

795
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,000
um successful so

796
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,039
um yeah i just want to mention

797
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,919
studies related to butter polling audits

798
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,520
can be left to future work

799
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
so for us it's actually no problem to

800
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,799
generate different

801
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
questionnaires that we can kind of send

802
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,399
out to people using different

803
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,919
crowdsourcing platforms

804
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,000
which we plan to do in the fall we

805
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,399
haven't actually gotten to it yet

806
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,440
but this is left to future work

807
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,480
and there's a disclaimer so you know

808
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,200
just these and maybe i'm repeating this

809
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,720
one more time too many

810
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,880
but uh we are talking about comparison

811
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
audits here and not ballot polling audit

812
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,559
so when you do a ballot polling audit

813
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,840
then usually the numbers of the samples

814
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,080
are

815
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,600
slightly bigger all right

816
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,279
so we're moving on to the defense

817
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,320
mechanisms and the defense mechanisms is

818
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,720
like

819
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,000
what can you actually do against a

820
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,080
threat like such a diversion

821
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,360
disinformation play okay so i think

822
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,760
there are if there are four things that

823
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,279
we have identified

824
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,679
and the first one would be you know

825
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,520
target smaller constituencies so when

826
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,799
you do a risky ring audit

827
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,880
don't just do it in an entire country

828
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,919
but kind of

829
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,159
find a jurisdiction level constituency

830
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,840
level that is small enough

831
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,840
so that the the problem can be better

832
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,320
compartmentalized

833
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,799
now of course this idea is very much

834
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,799
against any kind of legislation the

835
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,720
legislation says you have to sample like

836
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
this you have to sample like this

837
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,799
but this is it doesn't say that these

838
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,320
these ideas here of mitigations are

839
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,120
practical

840
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,240
or possible or possibly even useful but

841
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,320
these are just ideas

842
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,760
okay the second idea is something that

843
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,840
one could consider i don't know what the

844
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,520
negative side effect is and that is to

845
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,679
artificially inflate the sample size

846
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,120
so the system says you know pick 142

847
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,039
ballots but you decide to

848
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,480
audit 1420 ballots instead

849
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,440
just because you know that you know

850
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,279
people might be

851
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,520
more easily swayed to disbelieve in the

852
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,559
election result

853
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,240
just because the sample size is too

854
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
small

855
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,320
you could also strengthen basic

856
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,159
education in statistics which is like a

857
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,760
very sweeping

858
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,520
mitigation which also is not really

859
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,919
implementable

860
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,360
and it will take many many years to to

861
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,039
to kind of come to fruition but i think

862
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,720
the fact is that

863
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
statistics can be somewhat

864
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,799
counterintuitive at times

865
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,159
and we've seen this with these small

866
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,240
sample sizes here so

867
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,279
one way to strengthen um

868
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,600
you know or to mitigate the threat of a

869
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,640
divergent

870
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,360
disinformation play as i've described

871
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,919
earlier

872
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,440
is to just kind of strengthen basic

873
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960
education and statistics and i don't

874
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,159
know how to do this

875
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,640
maybe uh doing you know using proactive

876
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,520
kind of

877
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,159
advertisement or putting stuff on

878
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,320
youtube explaining the things better

879
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,440
making more palatable making

880
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,480
uh in civil education classes

881
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,799
for kids you know start thinking about

882
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,559
those kind of

883
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,840
techniques of to of how to mitigate

884
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,919
um these kind of threats so these are

885
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,080
all ideas how practical they are i don't

886
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,720
know

887
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,960
and the other one is just be proactive

888
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,120
um that could be

889
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,600
a uh i'm a strong believer in

890
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,039
transparency

891
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,320
so so i think that would be

892
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,960
being proactive and talking about it and

893
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,320
presenting um

894
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,720
the the the real rationales why those

895
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,240
numbers are so small

896
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,880
continue actually um putting these kind

897
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,440
of

898
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,279
information and you know out in the

899
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,440
public discourse that would be one way

900
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,159
to mitigate the threat and with this i

901
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,120
would like

902
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,520
to thank you for your attention and i'm

903
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,559
i'm ready to take

904
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:05,840
questions thank you so much bye-bye
