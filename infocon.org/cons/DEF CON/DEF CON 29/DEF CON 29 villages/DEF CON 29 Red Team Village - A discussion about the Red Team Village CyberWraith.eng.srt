so uh for defcon 29 can you give us a

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,920
somewhat of an overview of what we are

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,680
expecting with cyber wraith

60
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,119
i heard that you guys are giving a

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,639
thousand dollars to the first winner

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,360
plus job interviews and several other

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,000
prizes as well so can you go over that

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
and i guess i'll pass it back

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,040
first to you nigel yeah so but before we

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
talk about what's happening this year

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,480
omar let's talk about what happened last

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
year right

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,040
um so when we worked with you guys um

70
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,680
that was that was an amazing experience

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,040
and we learned a lot right

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
and you know at defcon you got to learn

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,480
real quick right um

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,319
so it was somewhat of a litmus test for

75
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,680
us but so

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,080
last year we took the top 25 and i think

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,480
was like a little over

78
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,160
340 550 people who registered and you

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
know over 200 participated

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,560
so we took the top 25 and they

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,640
interviewed with companies like google

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,000
hulu health mark um and that was like

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
our proof of concept so to speak right

84
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
so you know startup mode and then you

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,440
got to go out and validate these

86
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,599
hypotheses right

87
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,560
and out of the um the the top 25 there

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
was a 14 year old girl man

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
i don't know if you guys know there was

90
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,760
a 14 year old girl who placed in the top

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,319
25

92
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,959
yeah yeah so even more exciting we're

93
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,480
going to be featuring her

94
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,239
and her dad who both played the game

95
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,000
last year and they placed so they're

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,280
going to be featured

97
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,480
um within the stream this year and um

98
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,000
they're going to be back to play and um

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,840
and she's also going to be um

100
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
uh the 14 year old girl will be on um

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,920
uh we'll have a conversation with um the

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,360
sizzle

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,159
from one login you know and and women in

104
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,799
cyber

105
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,959
um so um we're pretty excited about that

106
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,440
so fast forward this year right um for

107
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,400
guys

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
for the you all who don't know um

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
cyberware network we have positioned

110
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,159
ourselves as the

111
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,200
first true cyber esports league right in

112
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,879
our game cyber wraith

113
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,560
you can think of it as call of duty for

114
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,159
ethical hackers it's pretty cool you

115
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,400
know you get to log to hack drones

116
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,879
cell phones you complete missions and

117
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,799
the storyline is amazing along with the

118
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,599
graphics right

119
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,760
very um interactive and intuitive and

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,040
and you can tell you a little bit more

121
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
about the platform the capabilities and

122
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,480
the gameplay itself

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,639
but what we were able to do was we've

124
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,639
matched up the actual gameplay so while

125
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,160
while players play the game

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
we validate their knowledge skills and

127
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
abilities and we match them with the

128
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,320
real world job

129
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,919
opportunities right so we've we've

130
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,199
created these triggers

131
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,600
within the game and um we have this

132
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
machine learning algorithm that matches

133
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,240
the gameplay

134
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
and the player's performance to not only

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
the nice 2.0 framework nist

136
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,280
but also the cyber kill chain and matter

137
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,040
miters attack framework

138
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,960
right so we are we are essentially

139
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,040
taking the the um cyber talent industry

140
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,479
and we're kind of gelling it with the

141
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,000
whole esports league right and we

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
position ourselves that way

143
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
so you know it's it's it's kind of

144
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,919
esports with a purpose right

145
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,560
so this year we're going to do um

146
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680

147
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,720
to um setting up these interviews

148
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
for the top performers we're also giving

149
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,800

150
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,919
prize

151
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,600
500 for the second prize and 250

152
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600

153
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,960

be very impressed with what we have

169
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,400
going on

170
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,720
um i'll turn that over to genio to talk

171
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,919
a little bit more about the game and the

172
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,280
capabilities and

173
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,440
stuff like that okay so let me just

174
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,479
start off and just

175
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
um um kind of blow everyone's mind real

176
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,160
quick i want to want to

177
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,600
kind of take a step back and realize a

178
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,199
lot of what just got said and one of the

179
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,160
biggest things on that

180
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,199
is that behind this game is not

181
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,280
a simple little filter okay here this

182
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,479
equals this equals that

183
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,560
the team at cwn has spent a lot of time

184
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,919
on this algorithm so that

185
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
we're not you're not going to get these

186
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,280
oh you're perfect for this match right

187
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,400
and it's like a

188
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
10 times developer and things like that

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,479
like a lot of work was put on our back

190
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:22,880
end

191
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
now that being said the obvious problem

192
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,160
is

193
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
man i've played every every hacking game

194
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
created since um

195
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
19 you know 85-ish give or take

196
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,280
um and they all man they all they all

197
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
really try but it's really hard to take

198
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,639
what we do and turn it into a game

199
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,639
and well that's what happens and that's

200
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,680
what happened and so

201
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,400
we have this really great um the best

202
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
way to think about it is

203
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,599
really it is an a an operating system

204
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:51,919
right

205
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,479
so you get to use um our operating

206
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,120
system

207
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
to play a series of puzzles so imagine

208
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,400
if you had a defcon

209
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,599
contest 24 hours a day

210
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,520
on top of that you can we have the

211
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
capabilities of creating networks and

212
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,400
entire 3d worlds and environments and so

213
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,360
when we say you can hack a drone uh and

214
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,639
do cool stuff like that

215
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,560
we mean there's there's likely and

216
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,319
depending on the scenario where it is

217
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,400
in some cases you're simply looking at a

218
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,680
um 3d map

219
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,000
of say the topography and you're trying

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
to look for heat signatures

221
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,560
in other cases you might actually see um

222
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
from the perspective of this other drone

223
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,280
right

224
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,840
we have light out scenarios we have full

225
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,880
functioning

226
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,120
3d environments and it's really

227
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
immersive there's real stories there's

228
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
real writing

229
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,400
um and so it's not something that one

230
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,759
generally gets bored in

231
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,840
if you know penetration testing or

232
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
hacking in general you know it's a lot

233
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,639
of the same commands you're using a lot

234
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,919
of the same tools

235
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,720
in different scenarios and while there

236
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,120
is

237
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
some repetition because in most hacking

238
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,479
there is repetition

239
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,479
um i think we've done a really good job

240
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,240
in the team that supports the game

241
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,879
itself

242
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,599
has done a really good job at taking all

243
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,080
of

244
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
the things that most of us find as

245
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,919
mundane

246
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,919
and turned into a really fun experience

247
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,599
and we got everything from open source

248
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,879
intelligence you're

249
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,400
you're on the command line you know

250
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,639
you've got real life feedback

251
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
um all our favorite tools are mapped in

252
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,120
a way or another

253
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,479
um into these gamified tools so while

254
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,160
to someone who is new to the experience

255
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
and they're just learning they're like

256
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
man i think i might want to get into

257
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,840
cyber security

258
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
we can honestly say man play our game

259
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
because you'll real quickly find out

260
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,360
what you love about

261
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,200
cyber security you'll real quickly find

262
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,799
out what your goal is

263
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,399
and we on the back end are really

264
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,799
keeping track of how you do and what you

265
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,519
do

266
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,000
um and then we we give that to uh the

267
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,920
presenting that to the employers and so

268
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,360
when someone says man we want somebody

269
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
who's fresh they love hacking but

270
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
they're just new to the industry we need

271
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,839
something that

272
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,200
someone who's willing to learn well

273
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,600
guess what man we can get you

274
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,959
from from that want to that employee

275
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,120
and it's all real you you can try and

276
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
fake it if you want but ultimately

277
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,560
um i can tell you the guys in the back

278
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
end have done a really good job to

279
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,959
ensure that uh

280
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,640
um we're gonna find all the little

281
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,000
skills that most people don't even think

282
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,959
to uh

283
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,120
to even test for because there's not

284
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,480
there hasn't been a really good way to

285
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,120
test it

286
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
and i think we have found really the

287
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,519
small place in the middle that helps us

288
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,920
do that translation for people uh

289
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,680
literally you have a team where

290
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,240
there's me i'm in depth i could tell you

291
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
ridiculous amounts of code and stuff

292
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,560
and you got nigel and nigel will stare

293
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,839
at you and say i don't know what you

294
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,279
want me to do with this code

295
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,880
right he it but and using that dynamic

296
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
we have successfully brought

297
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,680
this to this project to where it is now

298
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,080
so

299
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
um omar this this kind of brings back

300
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,920
um some memories so the the first time

301
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,519
that we kind of debuted

302
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,959
um the game and cyber wraith um

303
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,720
at any live event that was at texas

304
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,399
cyber summit right

305
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,440
and um and it's funny this is how

306
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,839
how new i i'm still very new to the

307
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,880
cyber

308
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,040
culture right you know that's why you

309
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,079
know how to go out and get subject

310
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,279
matters first like

311
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,839
our uh like hineo and some other folks

312
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,800
on the team anyways

313
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,560
so we're at cyber we're at texas cyber

314
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
sermon and we have all of the laptops

315
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,920
set up and we're running the games right

316
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
and we're inviting people to come over

317
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,760
and you know there were some like

318
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
seasoned people like hey you don't want

319
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,640
just like he said you know i've seen

320
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,839
every game

321
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,680
whatever it is maybe i'll sit down for

322
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,279
10 minutes right you know an

323
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,959
hour and a half later we're nudging each

324
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,160
other and be like and this is the same

325
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,920
person who's still sitting here right

326
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,600
and then they come back the next day and

327
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,519
then they come back the third day right

328
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,320
so um we were we were standing then you

329
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
know they had the big photo

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,399
um background next to to our booth right

331
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,760
where we were at

332
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
and he neo goes hey do you know who that

333
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,200
is and he actually let you share this

334
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,600

341
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,839
so i'll let hino say who we met and then

342
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,440
you know he can tell you how long she

343
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
actually sat there and ended up playing

344
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
the game

345
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,160
that was our that was our mutual good

346
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
friend shannon um

347
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,600
yeah it was it was one of those weird

348
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
things you know you i grew up in this

349
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,399
industry to me

350
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,680
you know just seeing her walk down like

351
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,519
oh i know exactly who that is right

352
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,279
um i saw jason e street there i'm like

353
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,880
hey there's jason um

354
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
and yeah it's really it's just funny but

355
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,399
she sat down and she started playing and

356
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,279
you could tell

357
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,040
you know she was doing her job her job

358
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,079
is to go down there and take a look at

359
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,120
some stuff and wear

360
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,000
that stuff but as soon as that bomb goes

361
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,480
on and

362
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680
the intro music goes i guess the best

363
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,040
way i could put it is if you

364
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,440
ever sat down and been like whether it's

365
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
hackers or

366
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,720
sneakers or anything you're like man i

367
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,240
wish i was in a movie where i could be

368
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,680
the badass hacker right

369
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
if you ever thought that this is the

370
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,920
game for you because from the beginning

371
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,639
uh all the way to the end it's very much

372
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,440
in your face

373
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
you're the guy you're the man you're

374
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,240
learning an operating system you're

375
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,360
learning the hacking you're learning

376
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,079
your thing

377
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,000
your skill and if you're really good at

378
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
it then there you go

379
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,360
you know um if you're not there's tons

380
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,279
of tutorials there's tons of

381
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,639
walkthroughs on some of the earlier

382
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,399
levels um there's a lot available to

383
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,040
kind of

384
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
because again we're not trying to make

385
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,480
it where this is an impossible game

386
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,399
we're not we're not going to do really

387
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
well if nobody can play it

388
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,760

392
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,160
just totally amazing to see

393
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
uh all these people come in and this and

394
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,760
and i mean nige you gotta admit when as

395
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,959
soon as he came to me with the first

396
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,560
time hey man we got a game

397
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,000

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
i'm this is not gonna go well

401
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
uh but then at the same time i called

402
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,120
him uh i think that monday

403
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,279
i had had the weekend to play it i had

404
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,200

406
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,519
uh i've ever played i i can't imagine

407
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
uh i still have that email though by the

408
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,880
way

409
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
that that in a dollar in our first

410
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
dollar right that should be what's

411
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,040
printed up

412
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
uh because that was that's when we knew

413
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,440
okay we found that that mix

414
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
very very cool hey so we actually have a

415
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,240
few people that i want to

416
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,279
give shout outs to both in youtube and

417
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,800
twitch but there's a couple of questions

418
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
actually coming in

419
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,200
the first one is where do we get on the

420
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,279
game and i think that the ad is coming

421
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,120
but i probably missed it actually i put

422
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
a banner in the bottom of your screen

423
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,760
so if you go to retinvillage.io

424
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,000
cyberwraith you can register right now

425
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,279
as a matter of fact i'm going to share

426
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,160
my screen so you can see the page

427
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,120
and we're going to go over the

428
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,399
registration process in a second

429
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,279
and there's a very cool trailer in that

430
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,800
video i'm not going to play it right now

431
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,000
because of course we're actually

432
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,920
streaming and you're going to be hearing

433
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,639
it

434
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,839
but at the end of the the video today i

435
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,079

436
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,800

rate

439
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,800
the second question that i got from

440
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,440
the coolest one is the open world

501
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,480
missions

502
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
so this is like real you know what i'm

503
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,600
not

504
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,959
hit go ahead and tell them about the

505
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,880
open world mission and okay

506
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,440
yes um i i definitely was gonna let him

507
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,040
finish that one uh but let me

508
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,560
let me let me tell you how this game

509
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,079
this game doesn't have

510
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,680
an end now when i when i had got to the

511
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
end of it we had finished all the

512
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,959
content that was currently available

513
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,920
that included

514
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,120
um three actual full missions right

515
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
uh which were about 30 minutes to an

516
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
hour apiece

517
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,279
there was um something like 25

518
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,560
or more um bounties which are just

519
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,160
imagine side quests if you're

520
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,040
an avid gamer and then we had open world

521
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,000
missions which were

522
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,120
very much side quests with uh open

523
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
source intelligence gathering stuff so

524
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,720
you may need to go to a real wiki page

525
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
or a real domain name and grab

526
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,880
said piece of information um currently

527
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,320
we are up to i believe

528
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,279
like five or six um if not more with so

529
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:51,920
many

530
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,759
uh content packages constantly coming

531
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,440
out because it's all customizable and

532
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,959
that's what it was made for

533
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,040
um we also have what is called a hive

534
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
mind

535
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
so from your player base now this is you

536
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,559
know something that uh kind of close to

537
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,839
her but something that i think anyone

538
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,480
who's heard

539
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,720
understands um we have administration

540
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,520
packages

541
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,359
where you can actually build content for

542
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,559
the game

543
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,720
now obviously we don't let that for

544
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,919
everybody there's different packages

545
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,039
like that and that's more

546
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,559
of someone else's job but the point is

547
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,319
is that if you're looking for a game

548
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,919
that you can just go in and say yeah man

549
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,959
i beat it

550
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,599
it was no problem this ain't it i'm

551
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,520
telling you if you have if you come into

552
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
this game thinking you know

553
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,679
uh how you know i know every game i've

554
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,360
played every game i know it i'm the best

555
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,000
gamer

556
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,240
this is gonna mess you up you're doing

557
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,919
crypto puzzles like you find

558
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,760
on the back of these badges and and

559
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
coins in real life right this is

560
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,880
um we these are real tests that

561
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,960
have been gamified instead of a

562
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,480
gamification of

563
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
um you know a fake weak test that kind

564
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,200
of give an idea

565
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,320
uh so if i if you if you

566
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,840
think that you can sit down and play it

567
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,000
in a weekend um if you're lucky

568
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
you can you can get really far um i can

569
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,480
tell you i've had to play this game

570
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,679
15 16 times and i can no longer go from

571
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
beginning to end in an entire weekend

572
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,480
because it's literally just so much

573
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,280
content

574
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
and while that content is going bounties

575
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,039
will pop off now as

576
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
as it was hinted at earlier you can

577
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,080
decide to pick

578
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,440
a side right so if you're uh the way we

579
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
like to say this think nsai but on a

580
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,080
world

581
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
conglomerate right you're outside of any

582

one government

583
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,080
so if you help for instance the a bounty

585
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,160

590
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,360
involved in i don't want to give it all

591
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,840
away

592
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
but i can promise you if you want a

593
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
solid number

594
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,160
uh guarant guarantee 48 hours

595
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,960
to 72 before you start saying okay i got

596
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,360
it

597
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,880
and 72 plus hours is where i would start

598
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,200
because it there really is a lot of

599
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,799
stuff going on with their everything

600
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
from maltego for

601
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,679
uh stuff to hacking into phones

602
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,840
satellites drones like it's it's it's a

603
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
it gets crazy

604
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
awesome and i think actually you just

605
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,600
answer another question that came in

606
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
a few minutes ago what are the missions

607
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,640
consist of and

608
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
that was actually perfect now there is

609
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,000
another follow-up question

610
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,440
so or first person will be given

611
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,679
i guess for people that are doing this

612
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,799
for the first time

613
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,080
will it be given to whoever gets into

614
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,160
further is doing defcon or is this

615
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,600
person

616
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,280
only can do it virtually so let me

617
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,520
paraphrase i think to understand

618
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,720
so so basically i think the question is

619
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,400
can you are the the contest prices only

620
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,039
for

621
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
the time frame during defcon or is it

622
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
actually if i start playing right now

623
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,400
yeah so the the it's it's for the time

624
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
frame during defcon so the rules are

625
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,760
very specific right

626
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,400
um someone could go out and say they

627
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,919
wanted to complete the game right now

628
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,679
guess what you gotta

629
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,000
download the game be fresh and that's

630
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,440
where you get considered for the prize

631
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
still make it fair across the board

632
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,840
and it's not relegated to the people who

633
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,880
are only playing

634
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
at the lo at def con itself at the

635
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,000
location

636
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
it's gonna be the um the best of both

637
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,000
all right so for us we're all about

638
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
skills matter right you've demonstrated

639
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,960
that you're a badass

640
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,320
then you should be paid and you should

641
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,799
win it's that simple

642
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,840
perfect awesome and um

643
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,200
i think those are the pending questions

644
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
that we have do you mind if i

645
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,679
actually share real quick the screen and

646
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,919
we go over the registration process

647
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,520
sure so once again you know i'll put the

648
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,000
banner

649
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,720
also in the bottom of the screen this

650
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,200
link

651
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,760
is just very easy our website rectum

652
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,960
village.io slice

653
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,520
cyber rate once you go there you go into

654
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,559
registration

655
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,640
so it says registration i open and it

656
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,240
will take you to this page and i'll

657
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,039
pass it back to you so you can explain

658
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,440
so

659
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,360
i'm not gonna read the screen because i

660
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,880
think everybody here on the

661
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,799
on the opposite end is way smarter than

662
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,159
i am so

663
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,280
but the biggest thing to to um kind of

664
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,960
take in mind when you're registering is

665
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,000
that there is a

666
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,360
code for each tournament and there is

667
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
one specific to defcon

668
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,120
it is in the information package and is

669
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,200
in the registration package right

670
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,240
um so um the screenshots that you have

671
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,480
in

672
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,360
if you will scroll a little bit lower

673
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,640
here please

674
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
right so that screenshot is after you've

675
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
gone through the initial registration

676
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,120
you're going to get essentially inside

677
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
access to your profile

678
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,360
on cwn and once you do that there is a

679
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,039
tournament registration which then you

680
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,000
go in

681
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
and you use that code which is specific

682
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,200
to

683
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
the um the defcon tournament

684
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
and then that way we'll know that you're

685
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
in right

686
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,960
and and once you do that it's it's all

687
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,880
just um you know a piece of cake from

688
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,080
there right

689
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,240
the rules are also on the um

690
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,559
on the the main page or so they'll be

691
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,080
taken to the rules page after they go

692
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,280
through this process here

693
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
right when they complete it and um it

694
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,440
will answer questions like the last one

695
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,760
hey

696
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,520
when you know um when will i be

697
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440

at the end of the event just like we did

711
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,600
last year we're going to take the top

712
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,360

air force civil services right one login

716
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,000
google

717
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,799
we have some major partners who really

718
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,000
want to see what

719
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
your skills and your your talent is like

720
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
right so

721
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
i mean if you think about about it omar

722
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,120
one of one of the defining factors for

723
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,360
us

724
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,200
we knew that we weren't going to be

725
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
another job hunting firm

726
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,240
we knew we weren't going to be another

727
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
linkedin or we weren't going to be

728
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,960
another job board right our biggest

729
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
thing is how do we

730
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,760
essentially deploy data science to

731
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
validate knowledge skills and abilities

732
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,000
right

733
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,080
to make sure we know that we are

734
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,600
de-risking

735
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,520
the you know an employer's next cyber

736
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,120
hire but on the flip side

737
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
the coolest thing about it is that if

738
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,400
you are in the market

739
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,720
for no matter where you are in your

740
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
career except sizzle right except you

741
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,600
feel very high up

742
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,919
right but you know um you know if you're

743
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,919
a beginner or intermediate

744
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,240
you don't have to modify your resume 100

745
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
times to beat an applicant tracking

746
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,919
system because our algorithm does that

747
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:50,880
for you

748
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,360
right so you know this is a really easy

749
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
way to have fun

750
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,360
to learn to prove your skills and then

751
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
let us do the heavy lifting right

752
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
so you know for everybody who's

753
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,120
participating in the tournament even if

754
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,720
you don't you're not particularly

755
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,400
looking for a job right now

756
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,120
it's always good to have your resume on

757
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,960
there because when you are open for

758
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,120
for an opportunity then we can help you

759
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
market yourself really effectively

760
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,320
okay and that actually i guess it goes

761
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
into the next question which is

762
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,039
is it a requirement to have any of the

763
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,400
information there or can i

764
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,600
play without uploading their resume yes

765
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,559
you can you can

766
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,039
play and win the contest without or you

767
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,559
know you know even get prizes with the

768
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,159
contest without the resume

769
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,880
resume is not um a requirement for the

770
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,760
contest

771
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
the only two things that we require for

772
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
people um obviously

773
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,840
is to actually have an email where we

774
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,039
can reach you to send

775
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,679
you the the gift and then you're

776
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,679
required to stream at least 20 minutes

777
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,559
on twitch all right so that's those are

778
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:52,960
the

779
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,279
the to requirements to and and you know

780
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,880
have fun right

781
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
so um you don't need your resume in

782
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,360
order to qualify for the prizes

783
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,880
and participate thank you

784
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,159
so um i think the those are

785
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,960
all the questions that i see from both

786
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,520
actually no

787
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,840
there's another one just came in how

788
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,440
will the winner be determining i think

789
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,279
you you actually went over

790
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,240
that but if you can refresh so within

791
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,200
the game system

792
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,400
um we have our our own algorithm that

793
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,520
does all the waiting

794
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,400
and and matching and scoring and then

795
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,279
there is also

796
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,200
within the actual game mechanics it

797
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,360
shows you your scores and your rank

798
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
so essentially um we're doing this on a

799
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,200
timed basis

800
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,320
right um and um we may or may not um i

801
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,919
just put that out there have

802
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,279
a scenario where

803
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,960
you know the top qualifying people will

804
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
have to you know kind of go prove their

805
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,679
skills there

806
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,600
you know to be to be determined that's

807
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,720
all i'll say about that

808
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,039
but anyway so essentially um we will

809
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,080
have the leaderboard

810
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,400
up during the contest the entire contest

811
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,320
you will always see where you rank

812
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
and um you know you'll get to see who

813
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,400
were the the winners and the leaders

814
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,080
awesome so i'm just looking at oh

815
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,279
there's more comments

816
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,559
um so i know that some of you actually

817
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,000
just joined

818
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,919
some of you actually are asking again on

819
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,120
how to join

820
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,360
or sign up for the game it is in return

821
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,679
village dot io slash

822
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,400
cyber wraith i'll leave that in there

823
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,039
just uh

824
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,240
just in case because i know that you

825
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,159
know just people are coming in and then

826
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,000
the last one is are there requirements

827
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,799
for the stream

828
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,440
on twitch just wondering because you

829
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
know

830
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,880
my very small resolution got messed up

831
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
um so

832
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,080
so somebody's already planning to win

833
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,760
this thing so he's asking about the

834
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,039
stream so

835
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,279
that's pretty good so extra points for

836
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,559
white crap too

837
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,360
yeah i'll turn that over to higgs um i

838
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,640
know that we're still working

839
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,440
on on packaging everything together but

840
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,799
i guess we can give a little more info

841
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,320
on that be great

842
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,360
yeah i mean look if if you gave it your

843
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,159
best that's

844
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,760
you know that's that's all we're asking

845
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,600
we want to see you have fun we want to

846
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
see you play this game

847
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,840
uh we want to see you take the hacker

848
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,120
spirit of

849
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,400
you know um um being in a situation

850
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,799
where

851
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,880
you don't have all the answers you know

852
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
and you have to go learn and sometimes

853
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,440
twitch facilitates that be having to put

854
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,880
yourself out there and put on there so

855
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
yeah look if you get

856
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,000
if you have a low resolution i wouldn't

857
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
see a super problem with it

858
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,399
um if it you know again this is this is

859
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,360
defcon

860
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,399
um we expect there to be you know

861
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,480
uh the hacker mentality going on we

862
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,840
expect some people to try to cheat and

863
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,279
that kind of stuff so we understand that

864
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,720
there's some situations

865
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,039
um you know that that you might not be

866
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,159
able to to have

867
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,480
the super twitch with all the cool like

868
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,279
look

869
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,200
go on do your 20 your your 20 minutes

870
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,240

having fun

872
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,559
that's really what this is about um

873
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,720
having fun learning and trying to do

874
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,080
give back to the community it gave back

875
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,399
to us

876
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,640
awesome thank you all right so wow

877
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,000
more more comments

878
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,159
um some of them we already went over uh

879
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,360
before there's a new one that is what is

880
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,799
the difficulty from a challenge

881
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,480
perspective and i think that you hit on

882
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,559
that whenever you're talking about

883
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,480
you know he knew actually completing

884
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,919
this in a short amount of time i don't

885
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,919
want to throw you under the bus yeah

886
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:30,240
that's

887
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,440
that's a higgs question that's not

888
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,760
information

889
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,440
look you're you're not

890
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,320
and there is i don't believe a way to

891
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,880
test

892
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,840
every single skill set we have in

893
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,039
information security

894
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,440
okay but i will tell you that we've done

895
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,399
a very good

896
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,679
job of covering as much as possible this

897
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,480
isn't

898
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,080
uh where you have to know a very

899
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,640
specific um

900
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,840
exploit or you have to know uh you know

901
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,480
the the command lines for an obscure

902
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,880
piece of software released in 1940 right

903
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,440
we

904
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,559
it's not that super complex um

905
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,320
what it does test is things that aren't

906
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
normally tested you know so

907
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,960
is it challenging yeah that was that's

908
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,640
the main idea behind it

909
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,760
um but it's not impossible uh so i

910
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,279
believe that if you're

911
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,480
if you're super new to hacking or you're

912
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,240
thinking about getting into hacking

913
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,399
this is the game for you if you've

914
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,159
hacked every day of your life for the

915
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:30,640
last

916
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,000
25 years this will be the game for you

917
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,760
not because it's super hard because you

918
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,200
you might discover that

919
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
maybe cryptography is not my super thing

920
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,360
maybe i'm not as observant as i think i

921
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,240
am um there's a lot of self-discovery in

922
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,720
this game

923
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,399
uh uh that i think i believe a lot of

924
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,080
people can find too um

925
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,679
so i would say it's not it

926
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,520
the the challenge of it is not a barrier

927
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,720
for entry so if you think it's going to

928
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,480
be too easy

929
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,679
and you don't want to waste your time i

930
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,200
mean that's your own choice but i can

931
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,240
tell you right now that

932
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,039
um there's enough content there that

933
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,520
you'll

934
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,720
you may uh have your workflow down right

935
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,000
you do your recon you got

936
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,480
your uh exploits you got your pivoting

937
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,919
you got all that kind of stuff

938
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,240
um but i don't think anyone is going to

939
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,120
just necessarily

940
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,520
walk all the way through it um and say

941
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,720
in an evening

942
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,640
but then again it's defcon so it could

943
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,000
happen uh we're not

944
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,520
saying with the super challenges game

945
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
we're saying hey we challenge you to

946
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,320
give us a try

947
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,720
and so i i it's welcome for everybody if

948
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,919
you if you have

949
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,360
uh an hour or five and you want to come

950
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,159
and just

951
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,320
chill out uh remember one of the things

952
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,919
i don't think it's touched on a lot

953
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,720
is it the game actually has the ability

954
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
for you to self-host essentially

955
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,520
what is essentially an irc internally to

956
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:45,840
you

957
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,679
and to your your buddies and so you

958
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,120
don't have to hack alone man bring your

959
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,520
crew

960
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,679
bring your buddies sit in a lobby start

961
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,840
a a you know a little fun game or

962
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,559
something

963
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,000
uh it it's going to be challenging um

964
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,519
on whoever you are and whatever you're

965
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,679
doing uh but it's not going to be so

966
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,640
challenging that

967
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,399
no one's going to have fun that's not

968
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,240
the point and as a matter of fact i

969
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,519
think that you're just touching the

970
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,000
question

971
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,480
that came in a few seconds ago are you

972
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,320
allowed to create a team

973
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,000
and win as a team or it has to be an

974
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,600
individual so

975
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
for for this one it's it's just

976
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,720
individual

977
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,039
but we are we will be coming out with

978
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,640
the team version

979
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,039
okay perfect uh the communication though

980
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,399
so if you if you have there is an

981
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,000
internal communication so that's between

982
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,200
you guys you know

983
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,960
um there is chat enabled and that kind

984
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,799
of stuff so you can talk but the winning

985
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,039
i believe is simply for you

986
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,880
this just means that only one person

987
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,559
receives the actual prize

988
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,000
how you guys split that up between you

989
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,880
and your crew that's on you right

990
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,159
so uh i mean

991
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,000
you know like higgs said you know invite

992
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,360
invite your friends you know

993
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,640
get your teams together and if you want

994
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,919
to do this you know i mean if

995
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,840
nonetheless you're just prepping for

996
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,399
our event next year right or so um next

997
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,000
year it will be a team event so

998
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,120
you're just prepping for that awesome

999
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,760
now there the other question that we got

1000
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,399
is

1001
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,320
actually many questions from the same

1002
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,840
individual but let me try to

1003
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,159
do one at a time it's all about the

1004
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,679
twitch um

1005
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,080
stream right so the first one is do we

1006
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,039
have to record

1007
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,559
the twitch transition i i assume that

1008
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,720
it's actually the twitch stream

1009
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,039
or share our twitch channel is it going

1010
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,559
to be a specific

1011
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,080
to an hour to stream or can it be a full

1012
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,679
stream for all the hours that we play

1013
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,200
how does that work

1014
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,360
so we'll be coming out with details

1015
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,799
about how to

1016
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,080
to to share the the twitch stream

1017
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,000
and when and where so to speak when i

1018
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,519
say where is from a

1019
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
link perspective right so we'll be

1020
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,559
getting all of that

1021
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,600
um uh information uh before the

1022
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,760
the actual event itself and we'll be

1023
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,519
updating folks throughout the event you

1024
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,159
know

1025
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,240
so perfect

1026
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,480
on that note if you want to stream the

1027
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,399
whole time stream the whole time

1028
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,000
if you don't if you're like hey man i'll

1029
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,519
stream my stuff but i really don't want

1030
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,200
to be seen i really don't like my voice

1031
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
whatever let us know so we can validate

1032
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,039
it

1033
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,120
we'll never talk about it again however

1034
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,880
if you like getting on twitch and you

1035
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,640
want to talk you want to show that off

1036
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,880
go all day go three days go all of

1037
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,679
defcon

1038
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,360
let us know we might even throw you up

1039
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,720
on our stream you know

1040
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,799
do what we can let's like i said we're

1041
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,320
all about the community and helping the

1042
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,279
community kind of

1043
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,840
uh keep on that fun and and hybrid

1044
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,399
defcon

1045
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,880
so and if you if you do stream a whole

1046
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,159
lot you never know what swag is going to

1047
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,279
come your way

1048
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,640
you never know so

1049
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,559
and then there's a question that i think

1050
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,399
that i can address is the cyber rate

1051
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,840
ctf different than the one on the

1052
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,760
eventbrite so uh

1053
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,120
for those of you that don't know what

1054
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
the one eventbrite means

1055
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,519
there are two different contests that is

1056
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,039
actually happening from the red team

1057
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,200
village let me actually go back

1058
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,679
to the site real quick and i'm gonna

1059
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,200
share it

1060
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,159
so if you go to our website you're gonna

1061
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,440
see two

1062
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,159
contests in there one is the defcon

1063
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,000
retin village ctf and the

1064
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,560
defcon rtb cyber rate the one that we're

1065
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,760
talking about right now

1066
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,800
is the cyber rate the ctf yes it

1067
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,159
actually takes you you know if you want

1068
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,000
to register to even bright it's the same

1069
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,079
thing it's not you know

1070
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,000
that's a separate contest so we have two

1071
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,119
contests

1072
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,760
during defcon both of them are hybrid so

1073
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,679
you don't have to be on site

1074
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,918
to participate but if you're on site

1075
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,760
we're all all gonna be sitting in the

1076
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,480
same place

1077
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,719
right very close to each other so and

1078
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,599
i'll strongly recommend for you to

1079
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,560
to um to meet with us right to meet with

1080
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,839
the team

1081
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,079
and and so on right so defcon is all

1082
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,199
about

1083
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,879
not only you know the presentations and

1084
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,839
the contents but it's actually

1085
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,918
developing this network so

1086
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,320
absolutely now there's another follow-up

1087
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,839
question that says you know i didn't see

1088
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,359
any specific

1089
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,920
listed if i needed something special as

1090
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,800
far as hardware

1091
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,040
requirements for cyber rates like pc

1092
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,480
specs you know

1093
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,599
can i do this sixth generation

1094
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,640
i5 thinkpad yeah i think all we need is

1095
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,680
a gig of ram right

1096
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,320
higgs and then everything is pretty much

1097
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,599
i cannot

1098
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,920
stress enough to the people out there

1099
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,200
that when we say

1100
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,720
game um it is not this is not cyberpunk

1101
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,240
right this is not a giant

1102
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,359
huge thing this game is a is

1103
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,720
literally stripped down the best you

1104
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
need like a gig of ram

1105
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,960
um half of a pentium chip and the thing

1106
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,240
runs um

1107
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,839
we are using you know latest unity

1108
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,359
engine um

1109
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,240
but it's not it's it's really beautiful

1110
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,720
how

1111
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,960
how well it was done that we don't

1112
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,320
sacrifice there's not

1113
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,520
a tons of super flashy graphics um

1114
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
and things like that but it's until you

1115
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,880
see it until you play it you'll

1116
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,599
understand

1117
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,440
uh but but i promise you you can run it

1118
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,160
on just about anything

1119
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,200
perfect and then the last question that

1120
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,079
we got here i missed the chance to get a

1121
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,760
virtual ticket and any other options to

1122
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,119
do it virtually

1123
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,440
um

1124
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,119
any questions any sorry so yeah

1125
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,240
so we we will have i know that um we'll

1126
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,839
probably have some more events

1127
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,960
with um with the red team village right

1128
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,400
but you can always check back for our

1129
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,240
from our website um you know

1130
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,920
that right there is more of a defcon

1131
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,359
question um

1132
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,079
uh other than a a c dub you know like a

1133
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,520
red team village as a

1134
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,079
contest library contest what i do

1135
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:32,720
recommend

1136
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,920
is um uh get at us

1137
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,359
on either the writing village discord or

1138
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,119
on our own discord channel

1139
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,359
and that way we can see how we can get

1140
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,040
you into the experience

1141
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,520
um you know so just hit us up and and we

1142
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,960
can work the back chance to see what we

1143
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,800
can do there

1144
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,960
and i think that addressed the last

1145
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,000
question about the event

1146
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,280
right somebody was actually asking about

1147
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,079
even brighton

1148
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,359
don't think you need a ticket to

1149
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,680
participate so we're not this is not a

1150
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,400
four-fee

1151
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,640
thing right so there's right now you

1152
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,160
don't have to pay extra even though

1153
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,520
it's completely for the community yeah

1154
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,560
and and whenever we do our events um

1155
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,240
you know we never charge for for the

1156
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,720
actual event you know so

1157
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,680
um we do this to give back and to to

1158
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,400
build

1159
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,839
to build the community itself

1160
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,440
awesome thank you i think that those are

1161
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
all the questions that we have had so

1162
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,040

1163
