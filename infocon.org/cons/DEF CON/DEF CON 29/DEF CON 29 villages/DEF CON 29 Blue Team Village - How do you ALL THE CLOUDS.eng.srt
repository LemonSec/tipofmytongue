1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,599
hi everyone

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,519
my name is henry cannabill and this is

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,519
my session how do you

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,119
all the clouds in this session

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,039
i'd like to cover a number of different

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,279
things first is base planning and

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,080
understanding

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,320
for your cloud and adoption needs the

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,199
second one

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,439
is to establish common security issues

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,279
for your teams and organizations that

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,079
you support

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,800
or for yourself as you're deploying your

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,920
workloads onto

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
a cloud environment the third is

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
recognizing your stakeholders and

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
partners throughout the journey

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,280
as you're maturing the process and

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
adoption of your cloud environments

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,079
and finally where the focus of this con

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,600
of this conversation i'd like to have

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
with you

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,079
is to introduce security tools insights

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,520
and perspectives

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,680
i am going to presume that a lot of you

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
are not as familiar with

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,920
how to really take advantage of the

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,438
cloud and so we'll talk about

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,240
some of those things and um what kinds

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,840
of tools that i want to share with you

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,240
that

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
could really help you on the journey so

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
some quick information about myself

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
my name is henry canval i've been a

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,960
security architect

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,799
for the last several years i've been a

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,479
security professional for

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,840
five plus years i come to you as a

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,280
former developer

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,240
i used to develop uh c and c plus plus

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,119
in java

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,479
about 10 15 years ago and now i kind of

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
do python on the side or

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,840
as part of my role as a security

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,720
architect

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
one of the hats i like wearing is um i'm

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,119
a data security

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,520
specialist within my company within my

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,960
team and so

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,920
more now that the potential role of a

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,640
log czar

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,119
really sounds kind of fun to me um

53
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,399
location-wise i'm

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,399
i'm from the bay area i live now in l.a

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,799
for the last few years and a few

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,960
uh these are a few of images i like to

57
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
uh encapsulate

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,759
my personality so

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,399
our talking target audience for today i

60
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,920
wanted to

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
address the it professionals and

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,599
engineers

63
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
that are deploying uh compute workloads

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,319
rather through uh cloud functions

65
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,599
or app for containerized applications or

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,720
even just straight up

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,840
vms to deploy uh you install software

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,720
onto it

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
i'd also like to help address the

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
security professionals that

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
are not as familiar with cloud and

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,599
how to provide them to enable them with

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,599
better tools as part of their advisory

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,120
roles

75
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,480
so what's the plan for today

76
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,519
to first address i want to clarify for

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,000
everyone

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
that i'm not trying to target a cloud

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
migration strategy to go through the

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,920
details of

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
why you should or shouldn't go move to

82
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,519
the cloud

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,120
i also don't want to focus on the

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,959
workload planning of how you migrate

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,560
your applications

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,480
uh from traditional software to cloud

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,879
taking advantage of cloud tools and

88
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,000
services

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,640
um this is also not an incident response

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,599
or application security type of talk

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,319
however i do want to focus on the

92
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,000
various cloud security challenges

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
organization

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
when you talk about cmmi that stands for

95
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,680
the capability maturity model

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,560
integration

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,799
it's a traditional framework for

98
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,000
application and software

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,120
development i want to apply it for cloud

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
adoptions

101
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,000
um thirdly i want to cover uh how to

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
for your teams to get started in

103
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,040
securing

104
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,040
your cloud adoptions more effectively

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,760
fourth i want to provide some strategic

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
and tactical recommendations

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
for the audience and finally providing

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
some tools and solutions to help you on

109
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,439
your journey

110
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,360
so when we talk about general cloud

111
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,480
challenges these are

112
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
pretty much the four pillars for any

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,519
organization

114
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,319
for any type of projects you look at

115
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,439
security

116
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,680
and general it's pretty straightforward

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
you look at the governance privacy

118
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,760
control your compliance programs your

119
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,560
legal

120
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
uh your legal teams as as they are your

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,478
consultants or your consultant or your

122
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,918
informed constituents

123
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,639
and stakeholders third we talk about

124
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,919
interoperability

125
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,400
how to deploy your systems and

126
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,560
applications to work efficiently

127
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
and to collaborate effectively across

128
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,040
multiple cloud platforms

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,880
the idea is to focus on the ability to

130
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,280
support a multi-cloud provider

131
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,080
environment for your enterprise and

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,880
finally

133
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
uh that sometimes uh kind of creeps up

134
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,160
with you

135
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,320
would be your cloud spend management

136
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
either for security or non-security

137
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,720
purposes

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
your finance teams are heavily

139
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
interested in how much you use your

140
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,240
your cloud probably focusing on security

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
challenges these are a number of

142
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
different areas that i've

143
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,479
discovered and have learned and worked

144
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,160
with over the last

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
five to ten years the first one i wanted

146
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,919
to emphasize

147
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,039
is the sprawled cloud accounts and also

148
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,240
the adoption of

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
multiple cloud service providers

150
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
oftentimes you have a lot of users that

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,039
just

152
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,800
i have an idea i want to push it up

153
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
there it's proof of concept

154
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,919
and you have over time a number of them

155
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,800
hundreds of them

156
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,280
maybe thousands the second area i want

157
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,919
to focus on

158
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
is uh at least at a high level is pretty

159
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,039
much configuration

160
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,160
and add to inadequate change control

161
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
you talk about you're protecting your

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
environments

163
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
when you enable your it professionals

164
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
your

165
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,160
your sales engineers

166
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,840
your and other

167
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
general engineers they can build their

168
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
own environments they like to believe

169
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,759
running their own virtual data center

170
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,960
there found some cost

171
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
in terms of operational overhead how do

172
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
you enable them

173
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
third one i talked about attribution i

174
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,960
want to make sure it's

175
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,400
when you talk about attribution we're

176
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
talking about account ownership

177
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
points of contact if your instant

178
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,680
response

179
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,560
um pretty much effectively providing a

180
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
reliable identity and asset management

181
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,199
for a number of people that need to

182
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,520
triage an insulin for example

183
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,919
and so with the rest of them they're

184
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,759
effectively around visibility and

185
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,800
control

186
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,880
of understanding how your projects are

187
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
being managed and deployed within your

188
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,960
cloud compute environments

189
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,880
in the end how do you make that visible

190
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,160
for a number of people

191
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,120
more than just your engineers and

192
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
professionals that are running

193
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,720
uh self-servicing their own cloud

194
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
services

195
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,759
so when i talk about the cloud maturity

196
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,880
model integration

197
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,639
this framework has been traditionally

198
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,440
focused on application developments

199
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,240
and deployments and so we talked about

200
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
these five different areas we have

201
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
initial managed to find quantitatively

202
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
managed optimizing

203
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,080
most environments um when you're

204
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,520
deploying software

205
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
it's pretty much again like proof of

206
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,720
concept thing uh

207
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
to all the way to something that's

208
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
really snazzy something that's really

209
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,479
taking advantage of cloud environments

210
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,199
um sorry to take advantage of their

211
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,800
software the tech stack

212
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,160
so we want to adopt this to to uh cloud

213
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,599
as well

214
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,720
so when you talk about the cloud

215
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,199
adoption journey we have these

216
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,479
these areas as well projects deploying

217
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,599
projects

218
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,599
typically that means a proof of concept

219
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,800
i have an idea

220
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,160
i want to run it somewhere else i don't

221
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
have a data center or maybe i just want

222
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
to stand up really quickly and show that

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,599
we are capable of writing an application

224
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,080
in this in a new environment

225
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,000
when you talk about foundation it's

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,680
pretty much like a lift and shift moving

227
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,479
it over

228
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,039
that you are using cloud it's it's not

229
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,319
your data center anymore

230
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,560
but it's the application you're really

231
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,319
aware it just still kind of runs

232
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,199
properly and so um you're you're pretty

233
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,720
much the basis of your enterprise

234
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,919
applications

235
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,160
we talk about migration we're talking

236
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,199
about uh

237
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,520
how much of uh application has been

238
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,560
moved over

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,280
uh much of the the dependencies on your

240
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
applications

241
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
that are using cloud services but uh

242
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,039
you may not necessarily be aware of it

243
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,720
and finally reinvention rebuilding the

244
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
application itself

245
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,639
so these cloud migration strategies i

246
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,639
just talked about lift and shift

247
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,280
refactor rebuild in different ways lift

248
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,000
and shift is

249
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,319
typically when when you have your

250
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,919
application workload

251
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
um you're still leveraging you're

252
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,399
minimizing the type of changes

253
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,799
on your applications and moving towards

254
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,880
uh moving your legacy systems and

255
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,399
applications

256
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,839
and you're not really taking advantage

257
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,000
of cloud you're just moving it to a new

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,399
virtual space if you will and so with

259
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,320
each of these come with varying levels

260
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
of flexibility and effort for a reason

261
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,959
for lift and shift this flight's very

262
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
low you just want to pretty much

263
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
swap your software into a new

264
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
environment from the data center

265
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,399
or some other data or some other cloud

266
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
environments to a personal one to

267
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
something that's managed by the iot

268
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,519
organization but you're not really

269
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,120
changing much

270
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
we're talking about refactoring that's

271
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,240
where i mentioned about back in this

272
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,839
slide about plantation

273
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,200
where we talked about refactoring a

274
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
little bit into using uh

275
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,080
new tools or new back-end software for

276
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,880
example

277
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,399
and then rebuilding when you're actually

278
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,320
taking advantage of things like

279
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
auto scaling and when you descale as

280
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,680
well

281
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,560
or as drawing passwords with the kms

282
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,880
that the provider uses that

283
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,600
you're not using something a little more

284
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,959
dynamic and can be

285
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,320
with your compute systems as well so it

286
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,160
takes more effort to put into it but at

287
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
least uh fits all your

288
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,160
uh your flexibility flexibility needs

289
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,880
so when we talk about cmi that's where i

290
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,000
want to adapt this for

291
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,240
cloud adoption where i see proof of

292
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,839
concepting where

293
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,959
that's where i talked about here with

294
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,440
projects early in the stage it's part of

295
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,120
the initial adoption of

296
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,079
cloud of cloud services then you kind of

297
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,440
go through the gradient of

298
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
becoming until you're optimizing really

299
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
taking advantage of

300
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,920
cloud services

301
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,519
for this talk as well we target the

302
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,680
audience and the trajectory

303
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,399
for where where are you typically and

304
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
for this talk i want to focus

305
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,880
on the the stage from foundational to

306
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,000
migration

307
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
when you're from lift and shift to

308
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,760
refactoring

309
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,800
what are the things that you need to

310
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
take advantage of at

311
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,760
one when you're when you're leveraging a

312
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
lot of these cloud services

313
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,320
do you have visibility to it can you see

314
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,040
it

315
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
can you extract enough information and

316
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,480
centralize it

317
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
for areas or tools that you use already

318
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,440
so we talked about security there's four

319
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,480
different areas

320
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,399
you want to protect and it starts with

321
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,680
your infrastructure

322
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,000
your applications themselves your data

323
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,959
and your people

324
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,079
keep in mind because these four topics

325
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,440
these are very important for

326
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
especially privacy teams from legal

327
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,279
your compliance teams your i.t teams and

328
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,240
then your engineer

329
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,560
so covering a number of different basis

330
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
so for security clouded options um

331
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
as the security professional these are

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,839
the 10 different things i look for

333
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,839
when looking at the objectives and

334
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,720
how you're protected and how do you be

335
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,360
more

336
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
cloud specific and so i want to uh i

337
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,640
don't i'm not going to go through all

338
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,920
these in particular but

339
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,120
uh the first two at least just basically

340
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,640
taking advantage of of cloud it's really

341
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,480
easy to scan and be dynamic in a cloud

342
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,839
environment so you have to

343
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,160
match that and how you you have to build

344
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
that in early

345
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
once you've done the lift and shift how

346
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,880
do you update

347
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
and aggressively challenge your

348
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,120
processes

349
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,880
so next few slides we're going to kind

350
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,160
of i'll just kind of

351
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
blow through them really quickly since

352
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,200
that's the focus

353
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,440
in a cloud environment model it's always

354
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,639
shared

355
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,120
the shared security models so you talked

356
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,680
about

357
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,320
who's responsible for what on a cloud

358
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,040
platform

359
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,480
so as i mentioned before about uh people

360
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
data applications infrastructure there

361
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
is a breakdown and so

362
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
it's all the responsibilities for the

363
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,399
cloud provider a lot of it is on the

364
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,920
organization using

365
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,440
you as a customer using the platform

366
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,680
so when you talk about multiple cloud

367
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,800
services here

368
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,160
are a number of different tools

369
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,000
across the different uh software

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,839
services um

371
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,320
uh cloud providers aws azure and gcp are

372
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,800
the the three top most ones and so

373
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
you break it down into compute services

374
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,880
database services

375
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,959
storage services networking services

376
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,800
here's a number of different

377
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,440
um when you the products for each

378
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,920
service

379
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,120
for each cloud provider

380
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,560
from the security perspective

381
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
specifically the different

382
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,600
these are the different areas that you

383
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,639
would want to focus on for each types of

384
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,760
cloud service we bring

385
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
back to the stakeholders as i mentioned

386
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
earlier here's a further breakdown

387
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,279
with including the common descriptions

388
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,600
and common rules i leave it to you to

389
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,279
check this out

390
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,480
either here or after the

391
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,440
presentation so when you look at

392
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,360
protecting your environments i like

393
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
referring back to technology tools and

394
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,720
processes

395
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,040
the technology refers to the

396
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,519
capabilities of the technology the csp

397
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,399
provider

398
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,959
or what or uh pretty much what do they

399
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,000
offer natively

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,320
what types of features and capabilities

401
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
like auto scaling is a simple example of

402
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,120
it

403
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,079
or some sort of ins or credential store

404
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,160
in terms of tools what do they offer

405
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,880
the csv itself or other third party

406
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,920
providers

407
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,160
and thirdly in terms of processes what

408
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,040
um

409
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,519
your own processes of your solution of

410
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,839
management of

411
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,680
what are areas that when you manage the

412
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,519
environments what are your choke points

413
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,240
and

414
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
uh you need to cost them and also

415
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
identify how to improve them

416
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,240
so in terms of simplification i want to

417
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,760
focus on the tools that's why i

418
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,279
mentioned a few times on this slide deck

419
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,680
the hardest thing to is to identify the

420
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
biggest pain points

421
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,360
and also how to optimize them so there's

422
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,800
a number of different topics in terms of

423
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
devops

424
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,199
that really focus on optimizing

425
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:31,360
inefficiencies

426
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
and so when you programmatically target

427
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,240
those it's a lot easier to

428
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,639
scale out your operations your time

429
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,480
pretty much

430
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,360
so when you talk about tools i i pretty

431
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,160
much have this

432
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,199
um basic formula build versus buy and

433
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:47,680
then

434
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,079
time drop rate that helps define your

435
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,199
tcl your total cost information

436
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,880
from a strategic recommendation

437
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,560
perspective i want to provide a number

438
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,680
of different areas that

439
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,880
help you drive success you want to

440
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,440
work with you want to enable visibility

441
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,959
for your organization

442
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,440
you want to run tools more easily you

443
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,320
want to expand

444
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
coverage for the different tools and the

445
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,680
different

446
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,560
services that you're leveraging um we

447
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,000
also want to make sure that

448
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,920
uh you extend your current capabilities

449
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,120
your tools your skill sets uh

450
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
in terms of tools like sim in terms of

451
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,240
cornell

452
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,839
you have a number of people that are

453
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
that you're that are your sysops

454
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,000
do you have particular strengths in

455
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,480
different areas uh optimize

456
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,759
your time pretty much other areas for

457
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,560
consideration

458
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,759
i list over here how are you what are

459
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,360
your dependencies

460
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,680
um some of these tools are they actively

461
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,560
maintained

462
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,320
uh what kind of support levels uh

463
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
support models are they offering

464
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
do they have a freemium model so you can

465
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,399
try before you buy

466
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,160
things like that for

467
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,279
common cloud security solutions um i

468
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
categorize them to these three areas

469
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,000
these theme are these are pretty common

470
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,360
when you talk about

471
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,320
migrating to the cloud um these are

472
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,199
three different

473
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
type of security strategies um or

474
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,399
solutions

475
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,199
to monitor based on the different types

476
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:17,920
of

477
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,160
activities or usage of it cwpp uh you're

478
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,720
focusing on your workloads

479
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,040
you can talk about containers or cloud

480
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,839
functions

481
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,600
how they're often they're being executed

482
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
from where how who's triggering it

483
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,720
access control

484
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,600
things like that cspm i focus on

485
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,240
generally

486
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,600
i talk about posture management

487
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,120
and that mainly focuses on configuration

488
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,079
and your your surface area your attack

489
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,360
surface area

490
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,000
tasty is another one a lot of providers

491
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,079
focus on file handling and exposure and

492
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,880
sharing for example i like focusing on

493
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,279
access control and reinforcing

494
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,399
those types of policies

495
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,959
other things to also consider for modern

496
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,199
considerations for cloud

497
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
modern computer workflows

498
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,559
one of the things i feel is understated

499
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,720
when you talk about devops

500
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
one of the biggest focus for that is

501
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
infrastructure is code

502
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,000
however when you talk about

503
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
infrastructure as code now you're

504
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,439
exposing your infrastructure

505
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,880
if you misconfigure um an api

506
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,319
uh resources that may enable

507
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,280
a certain attack vectors but if it's

508
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,000
infrastructure

509
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
then you're talking about exposing

510
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,039
entire services

511
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,400
um port ranges is a simple example of it

512
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,240
uh the second thing i want to make sure

513
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,760
everyone understands is that

514
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,520
most if not all clouds are cloud sorry

515
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,919
cloud service providers they presume

516
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
their default configurations and wizards

517
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
are not safe by default uh the azure and

518
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
um gcp and aws when you go through

519
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,600
training

520
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,280
they focus on the ease for the it

521
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
professional or any professional

522
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,760
to stand up a workload but they are sure

523
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
to always correct themselves

524
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,679
saying like don't use a default so keep

525
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,360
that in mind

526
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,840
so technical recommendations for this

527
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,039
the rest of the talk

528
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,200
i want to focus on research tool

529
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,160
discovery

530
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,320
and how you can attest or stage your

531
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
progress

532
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
in terms of research i provide for the

533
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,559
rest of the talk it's pretty much

534
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,160
providing you a number of different

535
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,919
links so you can research and kind of

536
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,080
review these types of tools on your own

537
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,919
in different talks um if you're new

538
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,919
or or not as comfortable with cloud

539
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,080
security and you need some ideas

540
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,360
um what is entail uh what how do you

541
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,799
discover new tools

542
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,440
how do you discover new perspectives i

543
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:47,840
would

544
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,720
push towards um these are a sampling of

545
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,280
different

546
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,080
uh websites uh one of my favorites is

547
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,799
tldr

548
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,120
sec every week he sends a newsletter and

549
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,960
compiles a number of different tools

550
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,760
across

551
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,039
it's it's targeted initially for um

552
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,320
the application developer however uh

553
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,480
for absent purposes but they also cover

554
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,559
a number of different things so

555
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,080
container security uh cloud security

556
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,919
vulnerability management it's pretty

557
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,200
much the entire gamut

558
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
and so you can list a number of

559
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
different tools so it's a wonderful

560
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,360
resource

561
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,480
another one that i recommend is tony

562
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,480
blitz his repo my arsenal of aws

563
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
security tools he also built a tool

564
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,440
called crowley

565
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,919
so it's pretty good stuff so it's very

566
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,600
exhaustive a number of different

567
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,240
resources tools uh code scanners all

568
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,600
these different things that are mostly

569
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,120
open source they can try yourself

570
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,880
aquaset they they offer a premium type

571
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,840
of products

572
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
but they have wonderful content

573
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,080
regarding how to train and really

574
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,600
understand cloud security

575
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,760
and so i gave you an example here with

576
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,840
their cloud security scanner

577
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,360
there's a number of different links that

578
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,039
they have to cover the different topics

579
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,960
so i highly recommend those

580
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,120
and the last one i do want to share with

581
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,400
you is chaos monkey

582
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,799
while it's not specifically security

583
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,640
netflix has been in the game for

584
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,039
cloud adoption for a long time they've

585
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,600
identified a number of different

586
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,280
problems strategies deployments

587
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
and they want to share a lot of their

588
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
tools chaos monkey is an old tool that

589
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
was focused on

590
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,760
this concept of chaos engineering if how

591
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,080
do you

592
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,840
build more resilient processes and tools

593
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,559
so if part of your environment goes down

594
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,280
your stur

595
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,679
your service still runs properly and so

596
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,880
they like send that to

597
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,840
uh security monkey and then uh security

598
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,799
guerrilla

599
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,280
to do a lot of those things of detection

600
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,200
and remediation of

601
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,080
things that are bad for your environment

602
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,400
so

603
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
check those out um the other thing for

604
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,720
research i want to emphasize is the

605
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,919
attack vectors

606
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,080
the different types of attacks on your

607
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,600
environment are completely different

608
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,440
than data center

609
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,799
you've seen aws misconfigure

610
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,360
a certain setting and taking down the

611
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,080
half the web

612
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
half the internet because a lot of them

613
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,120
were using s3

614
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,960
as part of their web hosting so

615
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,080
that opens a new kind of forms um the

616
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
miter framework i'm just going to focus

617
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,039
on leaving these two here

618
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,480
that they've adapted their attack

619
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,559
framework into two ways one of them is

620
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,919
for

621
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,200
cloud specifically and two instead of

622
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,280
standard attack the from the attack

623
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
perspective flipped it over for

624
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
defend and so there's a link for that so

625
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,400
you can see how it

626
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
kind of pivots and how you can defend

627
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120
your environment as well

628
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,159
so other areas of consideration uh these

629
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,840
are different tools i mentioned earlier

630
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,960
and you can

631
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
rephrase you can leverage them over here

632
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,559
as well

633
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,000
for tools i want to share with you csp

634
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,159
cloud service provider that are native

635
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,440
to those platforms

636
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,400
gcp has two tools i like one of them uh

637
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,840
one of them's a generic link the other

638
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
one's for asset inventory

639
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,200
so they have a quick way of identifying

640
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,799
all your assets

641
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,240
i'm more familiar with aws so config and

642
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,840
audit manager rates

643
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,440
the im analyzer is also pretty snazzy

644
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,799
there's a number of different checks

645
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
from their credit reports uh the

646
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,600
iam credential report that you can also

647
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,559
port into different

648
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,120
tools that awps uses but the iem

649
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,360
analyzer is free of charge and you can

650
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,000
analyze

651
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,320
in verifying all the different aspects

652
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,000
so there's different ways

653
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,360
to determine your identity and entities

654
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,039
here's a number of different open source

655
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,640
and closed source tools

656
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,360
i list there's a lot of a lot of these

657
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,720
different tools to kind of reference

658
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,600
each other as well

659
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,919
kind of in a nested fashion because as

660
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,120
you realize

661
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,799
not every tool can cover a lot of things

662
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,480
so let's bring in a lot of things so

663
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,120
here's

664
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,360
here's an example uh one of my favorites

665
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,960
is scout suite

666
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,440
it can scan multiple uh environments and

667
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
see if it displays

668
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,640
oh no it doesn't uh there's a link i can

669
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,280
provide

670
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,000
if you go to scout's fleet um this this

671
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,720
link should pro

672
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,960
uh animated itself and so basically

673
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,480
those are reported and so

674
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,559
when you run it you can create an html

675
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,720
page and you can look at the different

676
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,960
checks faces off and for awfs or gcp or

677
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,440
sure

678
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,600
you have a set of security tracks

679
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,480
policies

680
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
that all assess against the

681
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,760
configuration

682
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,919
that's specific for the cloud and for

683
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,120
that provider

684
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,440
but also they look at it from cis as

685
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,039
well so it's great

686
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,880
i like using it for multi-cloud

687
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,720
environments

688
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,320
prowler is the one i mentioned by tony

689
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,240
blake's this is also

690
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,200
a linux based one to run and has a nice

691
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
ui as well

692
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
lastly i want to talk about simulation

693
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,279
one of the biggest things

694
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,480
um when you adopt new tools adopt new

695
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,600
cloud environments

696
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,400
it's really hard to recognize i did all

697
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,120
this project

698
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,159
i did all this work together i defined

699
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,200
policies i'm integrating and tightening

700
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,360
up my security groups

701
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,440
i reduced the number of publicly

702
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,559
accessible

703
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,400
services or storage i encrypted

704
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,520
my backups and my snapshots and my

705
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,400
and my um attached volumes but how do i

706
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,960
verify

707
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
it or how do i test my tools and so

708
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,960
these are a number of different tools

709
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,279
that

710
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,080
um that i think would really help you

711
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,679
kind of scale based on different use

712
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,480
cases

713
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,600
based on different um if it's

714
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
specific cloud or even you want to

715
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
extend it to kubernetes for example for

716
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
applications potentially

717
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,840
or how do you stand up environments that

718
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,080
are

719
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,120
actually bad by default uh sad cloud and

720
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,960
terra guilt are two examples of those

721
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,480
that you deploy

722
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,799
poorly configured environments then you

723
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,520
can test your

724
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,799
detection tools that scan

725
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,039
is tracking it properly so i highly

726
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,159
recommend those

727
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,799
um the last one flaws up cloud should be

728
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,840
awesome for you

729
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
that's kind of like the ctf you can

730
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
actually test and practice

731
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,840
your skill sets improve their skill sets

732
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,279
and also challenge yourself of

733
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,480
understanding

734
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,799
when when i see this how do i detect it

735
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,960
or what do i look for

736
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,799
so um that's pretty much it

737
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,960
so a lot of different videos i tried

738
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
throwing into in a quick 30 minute call

739
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,480
hopefully it's

740
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,799
not too much um i want to make sure that

741
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,320
you guys have enough information

742
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,840
to uh look back and kind of review your

743
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,159
what you've learned um how to best

744
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,279
partner with

745
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,360
if you're an id professional engineer

746
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,279
work with your security professional or

747
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,120
if your security professional

748
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,880
understand more of the different tools

749
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,320
and how to assess cloud if you're not as

750
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,279
familiar

751
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,960
so it's about synergy in the end working

752
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,039
with your organization so

753
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,200
in the end i'll make sure that you're

754
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,799
enabled with tools and

755
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,880
understanding what different processes

756
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,480
and to effectively work

757
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,679
smarter not quite so um

758
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,840

759
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,520
talk uh thanks for having me

760
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,200
uh thanks to the bluetooth village for

761
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
everything if you have any questions
