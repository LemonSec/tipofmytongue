00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,200
greetings my name is stefan stevenson

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,160
beau

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,400
and today i'm going to be discussing how

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,400
to detect attackers on your ics network

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,559
using your own measurements using a

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,880
technique known as state estimation

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,320
a little bit about me

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,560
i have eight years experience more or

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,640
less in infosec

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
i started off my career

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
with a power utility

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,880
it's a big one in the south

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,480
i'm educated as a mechanical engineer

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,239
but i've taught myself

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,000
pretty much everything i know

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,239
in infosec

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,160
and i currently work as a penetration

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,599
tester for coal fire federal

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,600
a little bit of background on ics

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,199
attacks

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,039
so attacks on critical infrastructure

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,120
are a thing now as i'm sure everyone is

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,559
aware

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,879
as control systems uh

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,960
continue to adapt more

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,359
common technology that are used in i.t

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,519
they open themselves up for all the

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,320
vulnerabilities that normal i.t systems

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,840
are prone to

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,200
the big difference is these systems are

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
hooked up to massive machines and things

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,040
that can kill people and cause major

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,840
disruptions to society

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,799
so

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,840
that's what we'll be talking about

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,759
today um for the purposes of this talk

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,320
i'm going to be dividing um attacks into

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,439
two types

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,680
one hard and fast

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
which we will not really be discussing

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
think uh

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,280
ddos ransomware things that are noisy

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,960
things that cause a lot of chaos

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,920
suddenly and are very obvious

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,439
instead we're going to be talking about

46
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,280
low and slow attacks so

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,399
think you know trojan backdoors anything

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,560
stuxnet anything where the attacker is

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,759
trying to

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,159
be stealthy and remain undetected

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,560
so traditional intrusion detection

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
you've got your ids's your firewall your

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,360
antivirus

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,000
um ddos mitigation that sort of thing

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
that those are all

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,879
things that are used commonly in it

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,760
but most utilities in my experience

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
stop there pretty much

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,000
when it comes to a lot of these security

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,599
products

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,959
their focus is on stopping them at the

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,879
it network before they can pivot onto

63
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,280
the network or just making it impossible

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,440
to pivot onto the network

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,160
by being disciplined about strict

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
segmentation between the two networks so

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,959
they can't get through

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
the shortcomings with this

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
these products and this approach is

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,680
that it

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
doesn't always work as we all know um it

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
doesn't really embrace the defense and

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,160
depth strategy

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,959
most technologies and problem with most

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,040
of these technologies is um

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,440
ot technologies like rtu's plc's ladder

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,080
logic controllers

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,040
they

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
you're not able to put a lot of these

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,480
technologies

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
onto these networks

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
one reason is because

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
they disrupt network performance

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,440
um and most net most engineers won't let

85
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
you put them on there because they'll

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
mess with things like reliability

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,400
latencies

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
uh jitter on the network um

89
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,799
and even if you could put them on

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,799
regulators like nerc

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,840
will often certify systems together as a

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,760
unit

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
and any kind of change like adding a ibs

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
or changing an antivirus signature

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,120
signature

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
could cause your

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,239
uh system to require being recertified

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,040
so

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,599
um is there an answer to this like is

100
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,560
there there really any uh better way

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,640
well i think there is

102
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
and it's physics

103
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,239
so the basic idea behind it is that uh

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,640
the laws of physics don't change

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
and neither do most ics systems they're

106
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
pretty much static they change very

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,920
little over time

108
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
power systems you know once they're set

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,399
up the actual physics behind how they

110
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,918
work

111
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,000
changes very little and often the

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
systems themselves change very little so

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,320
it gives you as a security professional

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
the opportunity to look more at a white

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,080
listing model which i know many people

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,520
cringe when they hear that but in this

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
case it's kind of appropriate because a

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,720
lot of these systems are very static

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
so state estimation you can think of as

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,440
sort of a numerical white listing model

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
so a little bit of background on state

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
estimation

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,400
it was a technique developed in the

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,479
power industry originally around the

125
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,720
1960s

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,560
it was not developed

127
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
for security because no one was thinking

128
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
about that back then but instead is more

129
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,199
of a way of ensuring reliability on the

130
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,160
grid

131
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
and preventing future blackouts by

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,360
detecting garbage data more quickly

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,240
but

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,039
for

135
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
given certain circumstances

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
gives us the chance to look at it as a

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
as a security

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
technique

139
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
so the basic idea behind state

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,840
estimation is you take raw raw

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,000
measurements from your sensors

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,400
you have a state estimator that you run

143
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
it through that gives you state

144
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,720
variables which the state variables feed

145
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,479
into your physics model which is similar

146
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,360
to the state estimator to give you

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,639
uh measurements that you would have

148
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,840
predicted

149
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,919
you then subtract those from the raw

150
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,240
measurements that you got and plug the

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
output into a chi-squared

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
distribution function which will give

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
you a probability that your measures

154
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
measurements are either garbage or being

155
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
tampered

156
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
with so there's no way around it this

157
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,919
talk is very math heavy

158
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,800
um i had to learn everything about

159
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,960
infosec on my own so

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,919
you know

161
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,639
infosec people can learn some math now

162
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,960
my chance for revenge

163
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,520
in more mathematical terms um they

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,199
basically have a bunch of measurements

165
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,960
which we give by the vector

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,919
z

167
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,520
and

168
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,240
we are trying to find state variables

169
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,199
x

170
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,160
that we can describe those z's in terms

171
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
of

172
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,680
um we for this technique to work because

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
it is a numerical method

174
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,440
we need more z's than x's um if the

175
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
sizes are equal or less than this

176
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
doesn't work because our system is

177
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
either fully constrained or under

178
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
constrained and we can't make a

179
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
prediction on whether or not our data is

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,319
good or bad

181
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,000
so uh to put that another way we compute

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
a system of functions

183
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,319
h of x which is a whole bunch of

184
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,840
functions that are comprised of our

185
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,400
state variables that give us our

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
measurements

187
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,240
so

188
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,039
since this is uh we have more uh

189
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,800
measurements than we do variables we

190
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,520
have you know n plus m unknown equations

191
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,160
and m equations we'll have more

192
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,800
um equations than unknowns which means

193
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,639
if there are more than one solutions to

194
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,560
this which means this becomes an

195
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,960
optimization problem

196
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,919
so

197
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,759
for the purposes of this talk we're

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
going to use the least squares method

199
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,160
there are other ways of solving this as

200
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,680
an optimization problem but least

201
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,919
squares is the most accurate

202
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:32,880
so

203
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,960
our goal for least squares is to

204
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,120
minimize j

205
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,080
which is nothing more than the sum

206
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
of the squares

207
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,720
of the differences between the

208
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
expected measurement

209
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,280
and the actual measurement

210
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
um oftentimes we'll put some kind of

211
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,240
weight

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,759
onto the measurements

213
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
that's basically a description of how

214
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,800
accurate is it is it's given by one over

215
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
sigma squared and sigma being the

216
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,479
standard deviation of the measurement

217
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
so the way we minimize j is the way we

218
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,319
minimize anything else by setting the

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,840
derivative with respect to the state

220
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,440
variables

221
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,039
equal to zero

222
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,840
now because um we're taking a derivative

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
we'll also need the derivative of h

224
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
um or the jacobian since it's

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,879
a matrix which we do nothing more by

226
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
just taking the partial derivatives with

227
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,960
respect to each of our x variables here

228
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,640
um i'm not going to go through the

229
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
entire derivation because for the

230
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,839
purposes of time

231
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,479
but essentially what you end up with is

232
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,039
an iterative method where you have an

233
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,200
initial value that you guess

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,640
subtracted by

235
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
uh some delta

236
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,519
and that gives you a next value x1 which

237
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,279
you then feed back into your x0 value to

238
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,519
repeat the algorithm over and over again

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,080
until your residuals end up being next

240
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,720
to zero

241
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,160
so once you figure out j

242
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,760
once you figure out j

243
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,560
you then figure out the probability that

244
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,000
the sum of the least squares

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
accurately reflects

246
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
the data you're getting

247
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,680
and this you get by putting in p for

248
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
zeta your probability for zeta

249
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,800
and your degrees of freedom

250
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,959
um here so obviously the more degrees of

251
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,959
freedom as you can see by this

252
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,800
um the cleaner an answer you'll get as

253
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,480
you can see we only have one degree of

254
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,959
freedom this doesn't really tell you a

255
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,360
whole lot right here whereas if you have

256
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,399
10

257
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,720
you get a much cleaner solution with

258
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
your most likely case being either close

259
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
to zero or close to one

260
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,800
um so you take one minus that

261
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,519
probability which will give you

262
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,040
your likelihood that the measurements

263
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
have been tampered with so a result of

264
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,480
one means that your measurements are

265
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,800
perfect and zero means that there's no

266
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,279
way those measurements can be accurate

267
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,160
but obviously for this to work we want

268
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,560
lots of accurate measurements with state

269
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,839
low standard deviations

270
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,200
uh so some basics about power because

271
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,800
we're talking about this in the context

272
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,320
of power because it was invented for

273
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
power systems

274
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,800
we primarily work in phasors we don't

275
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,040
really work very much in the time domain

276
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,560
because it makes the math a whole lot

277
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,519
easier

278
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,560
um

279
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
but otherwise

280
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
you'd have to work with complex signs

281
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,279
and cosines and stuff like that which is

282
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,279
really messy

283
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,760
you can basically think of a phaser as a

284
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,279
rotating vector

285
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,720
that rotates

286
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
counterclockwise

287
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,920
and has a offset and a magnitude

288
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,839
essentially from other vectors

289
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,600
so as you can see drake says use phasers

290
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,440
don't work in the time domain because it

291
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
makes your math

292
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
a whole lot easier

293
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,279
rather than having to figure out

294
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
voltage drops across inductors and

295
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,519
capacitors using a lot of complicated

296
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,000
calculus

297
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,519
so that does have consequences though

298
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,720
for our math we can no longer use the

299
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
simple equation

300
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
power equals voltage times current that

301
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,959
does not work anymore instead we have

302
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,959
three concepts now we have apparent

303
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,880
power real power and imaginary power

304
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
so your real power or your apparent

305
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,320
power is your voltage times the complex

306
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,519
conjugate of the current

307
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,839
which is broken into two components your

308
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,040
real power

309
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,399
which is what you think of when you

310
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,800
think of electricity and your imaginary

311
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,720
power which can kind of be thought of as

312
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
power that is basically being bounced

313
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,279
back into the grid because of things

314
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,240
like inductances and capacitances on

315
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,360
your load

316
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,240
the beer model is often used as a way of

317
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
thinking about it and optimizing this is

318
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,079
a

319
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,079
big part of being a transmission

320
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,320
engineer

321
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,320
so some basics on how the grid works um

322
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
power plant makes the power low voltage

323
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
stepped up to high voltage transmitted

324
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
at high voltage to a transmission

325
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,040
substation to distribution substation to

326
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,440
small transformers on poles to your

327
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,839
house

328
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,680
so a potential attack that we would

329
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
worry about you know on a simplified

330
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,240
grid like this is an attacker going

331
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,800
after something like a numerical relay

332
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200
so i'm not going to explain like how an

333
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,639
attacker would do that because we're all

334
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,639
adults here and

335
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,880
thinking about malware on a on something

336
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
like a numerical relay running windows

337
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,560
ce is not something too far-fetched

338
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,760
but

339
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,360
essentially for the purposes of this

340
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,519
we're worried about an attacker who's

341
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,440
very subtly trying to change a setting

342
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
in either

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
the potential transformer or the current

344
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
transformer which would give a

345
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,079
bad voltage or current reading this is

346
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,480
this could be bad because it could cause

347
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
a relay to not break

348
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,839
um

349
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,839
when the voltage conditions are

350
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,160
dangerous or it could cause it to break

351
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,639
and cause disruptions when situations

352
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,040
are not dangerous neither of which is

353
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,399
ideal so

354
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,839
we're going to see if we can use state

355
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,680
estimation to detect this in a simple

356
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,360
example

357
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
so this is about the simplest example i

358
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,880
could come up with for state estimation

359
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,079
normally a real life state estimation

360
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,800
would be way more complicated than this

361
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
but for this we have a generator

362
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,240
and a bus

363
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,839
and two readings on one relay uh

364
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,680
power power and then two reeling

365
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
readings on the other one

366
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
for real and reactive power and a

367
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,440
voltage reading right here on a second

368
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,920
bus and a transformer sorry transmission

369
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,720
line in between the two

370
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
for the purposes of making the math

371
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
easier we're going to assume that the

372
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,040
power company is giving us uh the

373
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,600
voltage here so we don't need a sensor

374
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,639
and um that it's one that it's the

375
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,720
voltage is one and we know that for 100

376
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,120
degree uh certainty this makes the math

377
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
a bit easier so we call this a virtual

378
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
measurement essentially so we're not

379
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
taking this measurement it's just given

380
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,320
to us

381
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,079
and these are the other measurements

382
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,399
that our system is getting and we want

383
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,240
to know if these measurements are

384
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,399
legitimate or if they've been hacked

385
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,240
so first we need a set of equations to

386
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,360
describe the physics behind the system

387
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,240
so

388
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
we have our

389
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
first z our which is equal to our just

390
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,959
the voltage so that's

391
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,440
h1 equals v2 is pretty simple

392
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,959
um

393
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,079
the others we're taking the real part so

394
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,120
we have

395
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,800
four power measurements

396
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,360
power one two uh real power one two

397
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,760
reactive sorry real power one two

398
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,600
reactive power one two

399
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,240
real power two one reactive power two

400
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,199
one

401
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,240
um which is simply nothing more than the

402
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,639
formula we took earlier with real and

403
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,120
imaginary components taken respectively

404
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,000
so use just by using ohm's law we can

405
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
get the current we don't need to measure

406
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,959
directively just by taking the

407
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,560
differences between the

408
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,519
two voltage phasors and multiplying by

409
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
um the impedance on the line

410
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
through substitution we get

411
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,600
um

412
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
power one and two

413
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,759
um and then we take the real component

414
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,720
of it to get the real power on the first

415
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,639
on the first line

416
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,519
and then the imaginary power on the

417
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,399
sorry bus one

418
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
and then we can do the same thing to get

419
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
uh power on

420
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,480
real and imaginary power on

421
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,320
bus two

422
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,199
um now that we have our equations um and

423
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,600
we know v1 for a certainty

424
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,480
um

425
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
we can cancel it out and that makes our

426
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,279
equations form into this nice h matrix

427
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,639
that looks

428
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
like this

429
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,040
and now we have all of our equations in

430
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,839
two on so we have now two unknowns and

431
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,839
all our measurements in terms of that

432
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,920
um which are

433
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,480
delta two which is the

434
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
phasor offset

435
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,360
between voltage 1 and voltage 2. we can

436
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,959
just call since

437
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
delta is just a offset we can just

438
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,160
arbitrarily call one of them

439
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,800
zero which again makes our math easier

440
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,720
so we only have two state variables that

441
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
we need to know as opposed to one as

442
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,959
opposed to three

443
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,839
so now for optimization so as we recall

444
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,519
earlier our goal is to to minimize j

445
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,880
which

446
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
is simply the

447
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,759
h values minus the z values

448
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,079
squared and added together so it expands

449
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,000
out to this

450
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,320
using substitution with uh h that we

451
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,599
just got it expands out to this

452
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,639
big long and nasty

453
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,880
so then using the equation that we have

454
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,480
the algorithm that we came up with

455
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
earlier for least squares

456
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,240
and using this weighted matrix which is

457
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
just nothing more than a whole bunch of

458
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,720
weights in a diagonalized matrix uh to

459
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,199
make the matrix multiplication easier

460
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,720
um

461
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,480
we get this for our h for our jacobian

462
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,960
of our h equations

463
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,280
we now run the algorithm and the nice

464
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,039
thing about the least squares algorithm

465
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,880
is it's auto correcting

466
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
so you can start with any guess and it's

467
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
going to lead you in the right direction

468
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
so we start with the initial guess

469
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,799
of zero for the angle and one for the

470
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,000
voltage

471
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,840
we run it and we get our

472
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,679
first iteration we get this for x1

473
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,120
and this

474
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,520
for our residuals

475
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,559
and

476
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,039
while these residuals are low

477
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,640
we can probably do better it's always a

478
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
good idea when you have a non-linear

479
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,400
system to run the equation at least

480
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
twice

481
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
so we run it again

482
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,679
and we get this for our

483
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,400
x value sorry we use this as our input

484
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,799
for our x's and we run the equation we

485
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,480
run the algorithm again and we get this

486
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
for our second

487
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,320
iteration for our x values

488
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,880
and this for our residuals this looks a

489
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,640
lot nicer

490
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,799
so we then normalize these residuals by

491
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,679
dividing by the standard deviation

492
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,840
and we get this

493
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
so then it's the sum of the squares so

494
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,440
we square all of our normalized

495
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,039
residuals and get this

496
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,200
we add them all together and we get j

497
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,799
equals 20.76

498
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,559
so now we use that as input for our

499
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,720
chi-square matrix

500
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,240
using 20

501
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,320
20.76

502
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,200
as our input for the zeta

503
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
and our degrees of freedom

504
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,679
um as input for which line we should

505
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,039
follow and we get something that's up

506
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,840
here

507
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,200
so

508
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
for the amount of degrees of freedom

509
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
that's a pretty clean

510
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,919
clean answer that our data is definitely

511
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,919
being tampered with and somebody is

512
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,840
messing with

513
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,679
one of the values that our relay is

514
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,760
reading

515
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,679
okay well that's great but now how do we

516
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
discover who the culprit is

517
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,360
um well it's actually pretty simple

518
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,520
we can determine which sensor was bad

519
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,320
simply by throwing out measurements

520
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,880
and seeing if that lowers our j

521
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
um if it lowers our j then it's likely

522
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,080
that that measurement was the one that

523
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,120
uh

524
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,520
was messing us up but as you can see um

525
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
by this chart when you throw out

526
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,039
measurements you lose degrees of freedom

527
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,360
so now instead of

528
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,960
operating on the three line we're

529
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,880
operating on the two line so if you

530
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,919
don't have lots of redundant

531
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,640
measurements this isn't uh you won't get

532
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
a clean answer often

533
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,480
um

534
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,320
so using the previous example we start

535
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,799
with uh measurements that we think might

536
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,760
be um bad and there's really

537
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,080
no way to do it than just guessing so we

538
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,520
start off with z4 check that out we get

539
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,159
j equals 4.16

540
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,120
and

541
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,840
our new probability that we get is 12.5

542
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,159
by plugging it back into the

543
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,480
chi-squared equation so it could be that

544
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,520
one kind of unlikely

545
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,320
so then instead we try chucking out z5

546
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,360
and we get 18.21 for j

547
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,159
um

548
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,520
which is corresponds to 0.01 from the

549
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,360
chi-squared function

550
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,000
so it's probably not that

551
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,400
so instead we try z2 and we get

552
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,080
1.626 for our j

553
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,120
which gives us a 44.34

554
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,039
probability that the estimations now

555
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,960
make sense

556
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,280
so as i said before with two degrees of

557
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,400
freedom

558
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
you often won't get a clean solution but

559
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,760
it's most likely that z2

560
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,159
um was the measurement that had been

561
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,120
attacked or was being compromised since

562
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,280
this raises up the probability so

563
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
dramatically

564
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,400
so

565
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,559
this tells us that the attacker was most

566
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,760
likely

567
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,840
manipulating the reactive power reading

568
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
on bus one

569
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,640
so with higher redundancy again and

570
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,799
cleaner data we get a more definitive

571
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,880
measurement uh answer on what the

572
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,080
measurement is that is being attacked

573
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,159
so in summary

574
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
state estimation

575
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,400
you step one create a mathematical model

576
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
of the system you're trying to analyze

577
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
the states of

578
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,000
calculate the least squares estimates

579
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,679
for the state you're trying to estimate

580
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,360
based on

581
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
the given measurements

582
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,200
sum the squares to give you j calculate

583
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,559
1 minus the chi-squared test output

584
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,480
where v is your degrees of freedom

585
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,799
and look at the output and see if your

586
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,000
measurements make sense

587
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,039
so

588
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,400
uh benefits of state estimation are one

589
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,080
you're using measurements that you

590
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,159
already have that's probably the biggest

591
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
one so as far as defense and depth goes

592
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,919
this doesn't require

593
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,480
um doing any tricks to add you know

594
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,280
normal commercial off the shelf um i.t

595
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,240
security technology onto an ot system

596
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
which is a big plus and if you work in

597
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,400
the power system industry you already

598
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
have these um adb spider g load flow

599
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,600
siemens spectrum

600
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,840
there's lots of commercially available

601
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,640
state estimators out there for the power

602
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
industry that again were not designed

603
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,960
for security but could be potentially

604
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,880
utilized for security um it makes life

605
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
much more difficult for a attacker to be

606
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
stealthy if an attacker is attacking

607
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,440
your your uh sensors they have to be

608
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
uh especially if you have lots of

609
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,080
accurate redundant measurements

610
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,240
they need to be much more careful about

611
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,559
how they manipulate those measurements

612
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,400
to avoid detection

613
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,440
and

614
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,080
a big one too is you can use it on

615
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,640
legacy analog equipment

616
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,559
by doing you know some digital

617
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,600
conversion but uh legacy or analog

618
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,640
equipment

619
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,720
um it's a technology that can be used on

620
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,039
analog

621
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,600
so uh future work because this isn't

622
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,360
really something that's being used right

623
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,159
now for security anywhere that i've seen

624
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,159
and if somebody knows better please

625
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,320
correct me

626
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,080
is what would be the best way to build a

627
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
state estimator

628
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,760
we have ones that are commercially

629
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,000
available but maybe it's a better idea

630
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,159
to integrate the data we already have

631
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,320
into a data solution

632
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,080
you know like splunk or elastic or some

633
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,880
other sim or maybe it's better to build

634
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,799
it onto

635
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,440
splunk like a splunk app or an elastic

636
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,760
stack app or something like that there's

637
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,200
really no telling

638
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,120
the techniques are it's purely a

639
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,279
numerical technique

640
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,240
so

641
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,559
it could be deployed a numerous amount

642
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,080
of ways

643
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
there are lots of options so it's an

644
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,520
interesting

645
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,279
uh be interesting to see what we

646
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,200
discover

647
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,320
um can be used anywhere uh it because

648
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,159
it's again it's a numerical technique

649
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,279
any system that's roughly stable follows

650
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,520
the laws of physics

651
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,039
you can use

652
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,120
state estimation as a technique for

653
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,200
detecting an attacker

654
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,760
it's uh it's an ics

655
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,919
intrusion detection technique not just

656
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,120
useful

657
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,799
for power industry

658
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,799
the only real limitations are that the

659
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,600
system needs to be mostly static

660
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,919
once things start changing over 10 hertz

661
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,400
there are there's research into dynamic

662
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
state estimation

663
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,279
but it's by no means

664
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,159
a well-established technique

665
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,559
so is state estimation a silver bullet

666
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,400
of course not we're all adults here we

667
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,799
know that there are no silver bullets

668
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,720
so it does have drawbacks

669
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,279
um requires a

670
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,159
well understood documented

671
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,720
physical model of the system

672
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,919
lots of redundant measurements

673
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:24,960
and

674
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,559
you're only able to determine if the

675
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,320
data is actually garbage so you're not

676
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
actually able to determine if the data

677
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
is malicious

678
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,679
again this is why it works best in

679
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,400
industrial environments where you you

680
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
have knowledge that your sensors are of

681
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,559
to a certain degree reliable because the

682
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,320
manufacturer has told you that you have

683
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,559
a mean time to failure or a certain

684
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,039
standard deviation and it is what it

685
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,400
says it is

686
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,840
and not something else because you need

687
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,360
to be able to trust that your sensors

688
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,720
work

689
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,480
to a certain degree before using this

690
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,960
technique

691
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,480
um

692
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,559
additionally uh integrating state

693
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,039
estimation into security is pretty much

694
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,600
non-existent at this point

695
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,559
most sock teams have no idea how most of

696
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,880
the systems like is if they're defending

697
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,440
physical systems they often do not know

698
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,480
the physics or how the um the actual

699
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,360
physical system they're protecting works

700
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,880
and even if they did

701
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,720
there aren't any sins that have any

702
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,960
ability to build state estimation into

703
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,600
them easily

704
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,679
and the state estimators that do exist

705
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,600
have no easy way of being integrated

706
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,039
into security products

707
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,320
so of course the answer is teamwork um

708
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,720
engineers that understand phys state

709
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,919
estimation

710
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,360
and the physics behind what they're

711
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,840
doing need to work with the blue teamers

712
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,039
right

713
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,279
teamwork and leadership is the answer

714
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,279
that fixes this problem

715
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,360
because often you'll have people that

716
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,600
understand this stuff they just need to

717
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
to work together and by working together

718
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,880
they'll make us all safer

719
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,720
so special thanks to uh professor sakes

720
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,440
at uh georgia tech i used uh

721
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,919
some of his work in this presentation

722
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,000
and that's it i hope you've enjoyed this

723
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,679
presentation and i hope you learned a

724
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,159
lot
