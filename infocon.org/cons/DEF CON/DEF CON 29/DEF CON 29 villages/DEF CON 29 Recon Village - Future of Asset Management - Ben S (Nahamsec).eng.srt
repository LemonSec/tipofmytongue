1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,599
before i get started i want to say thank

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,080
you to the recon village for having me

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,920
and today i want to talk about the

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,680
future of asset management

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,440
i really want to ask if we're really

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,200
there yet and if that industry has

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,559
completely grown

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,759
before we get started i'm going to talk

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,920
about our agenda like i said i'm going

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,680
to talk about asset management different

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,119
ways you can actually look for these

12
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,000
assets

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,080
some of my personal benchmarking i've

14
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,640
done some research i've done myself

15
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,279
and we're going to kind of live example

16
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,400
and then we're going to

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,760
wrap this up and hopefully i can do some

18
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,679
do's and don'ts and give you

19
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,520
a overview of what i think should be

20
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,200
done in order to accomplish this

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,480
but before all that i want to introduce

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
myself my name is ben sadigapoor

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,840
and most people online know me as

24
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,600
nahamsek i have been hacking for

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,920
as long as i can remember as a young

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,039
teenager

27
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,680
but i've been professionally doing bug

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,399
bounties

29
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
since 2014-15 and i've been really

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
focusing on recon

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,879
with even a bigger focus on discovering

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,359
assets and extending my

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,040
attack surface when it comes down to

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
looking at an organization

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,600
from an external point of view so let's

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,799
dive into it

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,560
uh bear with me it's kind of weird doing

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,159
these live presentations i'm trying to

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,360
make sure i have my notes

40
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,200
the recording is going fine so bear with

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,640
me as i look around

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,439
and we'll jump right into it so if

43
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,400
you're not familiar with

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,280
attack surface management it is a thing

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,960
a lot of companies are getting into the

46
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,759
space

47
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,400
but it's kind of a fancy term for

48
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,159
knowing what your organization has on

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,040
the internet

50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
so do you know what every domain that

51
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
you own every subdomain and that sort of

52
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
stuff and having an inventory of it and

53
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
there are big companies out there

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,560
like risk iq i think i would say it's

55
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
balbix randori coal fire

56
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,000
those are the big ones that i've heard

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,840
of and i think risk iq is in the process

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,799
of getting

59
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,399
acquired by microsoft it was already

60
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,399
acquired by microsoft whatever it is

61
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,960
there's also census census and shodhan

62
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
those two aren't really

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,040
doing asset management but they could be

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,240
used for that kind of stuff if you want

65
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,360
to do it internally they're kind of

66
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,399
expensive

67
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,640
but they do have that uh data for you to

68
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
use and get a list of your assets that

69
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,919
may be out there

70
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,840
depending on how they are scanning the

71
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,920
entire internet

72
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,360
so before i get started and dive into

73
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,720
all this i want to ask everybody in the

74
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,480
audience in the chat

75
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,720
you can drop this in discord but let us

76
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,160
know in the chat if

77
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,239
you know what your company has on the

78
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,840
internet do you know

79
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,599
everything just web assets that you have

80
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,120
a good inventory

81
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
and you know 100 of everything your

82
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,040
developers have launched

83
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,519
and it's currently on the internet so

84
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,480
that includes

85
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,599
the root domains that includes your

86
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
subdomains your ip addresses

87
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
your c2 instances your s3 or your

88
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,959
storages that you're using

89
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,200
if you're running stuff on heroku app

90
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
github pages and that sort of stuff that

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
also include

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
acquisition so if you are a big company

93
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
and you require some other companies or

94
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,519
some other startup

95
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,440
do you know what you have on there so

96
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,560
if you said yes this meme is for you

97
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,040
i don't buy it and i'm talking about

98
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,799
this based on personal experience

99
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
all right so the reason why i asked this

100
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,480
is because

101
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,599
having these assets externally being

102
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,080
visible to the entire internet comes

103
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,840
with a lot of

104
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
possible vulnerabilities that include

105
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
subdomain and dangling dns records

106
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
it could be expired domains so for

107
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
example if you've

108
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,560
purchased companyxyz.com for a side

109
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,519
project

110
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,760
did you uh renew that domain did you use

111
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
it ever again or is it still being used

112
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,040
in production

113
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,720
if you're using dev staging environments

114
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
meant to be internal are they

115
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,959
are they exposed to the internet your

116
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,720
continuous integration and development

117
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,440
are those

118
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
tooling internal and exposed you have

119
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,879
your back end

120
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,720
applications with a bunch of outdated

121
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,560
software probably because you think it's

122
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,680
supposed to be internal

123
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,959
you have your admin panels with

124
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,480
guessable passwords or maybe in some

125
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,200
cases

126
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
there's no even authentication involved

127
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,319
so a lot of these could be things that

128
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,519
are happening again these are things

129
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,360
that i have seen based on my own

130
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
personal experience as a bug bounty

131
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,879
hunter and a pen tester

132
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,840
um so i'm talking about a lot of

133
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,200
experience here the things that i've

134
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
seen

135
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
again there's a lot of times when i

136
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
approach a company and

137
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
i show them the things that i found and

138
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
they come back and they tell me that

139
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,400
um they didn't even know that that

140
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
belonged to them or that domain belonged

141
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,080
to them or this asset was externally

142
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,160
exposed and i'm not saying this you know

143
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
oh we didn't know this belonged to us to

144
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
make fun of the engineers or the

145
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
security teams but it's just mostly

146
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
it's a reality of a big organization or

147
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,160
a security

148
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,759
or organization of its own with a

149
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,240
security team that hasn't done

150
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,759
any inventory of all the assets they own

151
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,880
and again like i said it's not really

152
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
your fault because this whole thing is

153
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,320
incredibly messy

154
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,600
it's it's not easy to do it's not easy

155
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
to track inventory and the bigger the

156
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,080
organization

157
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
gets the harder it gets to think about

158
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
big organizations that

159
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,960
you see out there like google oracle

160
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
apple we'll talk about a little bit but

161
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,360
i think that's really really messy first

162
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,280
of all it requires a lot of skills

163
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
to operate and track assets so if you're

164
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,639
doing this in-house you might have a

165
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,160
dedicated team that's working on some

166
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,199
sort of project

167
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,440
to keep these things uh to track these

168
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,680
things and keep an inventory on it there

169
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
is no way i provide 100

170
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
coverage if you're doing a vendor for

171
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
example there's no way they're going to

172
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,160
give you 100 of coverage

173
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
that's not really going to be um

174
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,199
realistic because you're deploying

175
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,280
things every day if you're not scanning

176
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
every hour they might miss something

177
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
that you deployed for an hour ago and

178
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,000
it's been up for 12 hours and it's gone

179
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
down those are things that they can't

180
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,080
track

181
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
and again like i said it's incredibly

182
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,400
hard to scale these things for a large

183
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,720
organization like google apple oracle

184
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
think about like yahoo and amazon for

185
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,400
example um yahoo is not you know as big

186
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,520
as it used to be anymore

187
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,639
they've been divided into different

188
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,639
companies but think about amazon's case

189
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,160
amazon itself has

190
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
a ton of different

191
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
regional sites so if you're working with

192
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,639
amazon.com itself within the united

193
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,360
states

194
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,919
that alone has its own application own

195
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,199
microservices

196
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,360
versus the original stuff that could

197
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,400
come with

198
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,520
the portion of amazon for india or

199
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,840
amazon.de

200
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,600
for other countries each have different

201
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,039
backends they each have different

202
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,039
requirements dependencies

203
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,280
things that support it and each of these

204
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,080
different assets

205
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
could be in a different cloud account it

206
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
could just be hosted on a completely

207
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,080
different amazon account

208
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
than amazon.com itself because another

209
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,560
team another sub org owns it and that

210
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,960
just

211
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,639
gets bigger and bigger that list goes on

212
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,560
forever and it just makes an

213
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
entire scope of tracking assets a lot

214
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
larger

215
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
and a lot bigger obviously i'm not

216
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,919
saying like amazon or yahoo google have

217
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,120
these issues but

218
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,440
if you don't get ahead of it very early

219
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
on it's going to be very hard to

220
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,759
track later and you have to make sure

221
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,759
you implement things properly so

222
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,720
things that are supposed to be

223
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,479
internally visible only as they stay

224
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,199
internal

225
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,639
so you don't have to worry about so much

226
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
of tracking and keeping them locked down

227
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,560
so i said this again not your fault if

228
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
you're a security engineer you're

229
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,280
watching this you're on a security team

230
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,639
you're a cia whoever you are this is not

231
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,680
your fault

232
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
um you just have to figure that

233
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
especially if you're new to this company

234
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,479
so just let's

235
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,000
just think about the scenario you are

236
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,680
the new head of security

237
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,000
you are a security engineer you just got

238
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,560
this job at this new brand new startup

239
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,840
you learn the in and out of your

240
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
organization you learn all your policies

241
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,680
you learn how to improve a few things

242
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,039
you see all your pitfalls things that

243
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,080
need to be

244
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,560
improved and built on four years goes by

245
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
how does it look like now did you face

246
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
any reworks did you have to move

247
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,280
from an in-house space or an environment

248
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,800
to the cloud did you have to switch

249
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,520
providers from azure to aws because

250
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
you got a better deal or your budget was

251
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,879
cut in half whatever that reasoning

252
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,680
could be

253
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
how did you track everything how are you

254
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,639
tracking everything as you go how are

255
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,160
you tracking everything that needs to be

256
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
moved from one provider to another

257
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,639
there's a lot of things that could

258
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,000
happen in a few years

259
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,960
and if you don't have the right

260
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,039
processes in place that is going to be

261
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,240
extremely hard

262
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,680
to keep track of so that's just an

263
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
example of it why it's messy why it's

264
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,840
hard

265
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,160
and obviously more teams and more people

266
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,000
in charge people come and go they leave

267
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,440
things will get messy again even even

268
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
more messy

269
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,440
and vendors are also a big part of this

270
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,960
they need to step it up

271
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,599
we should talk about uh why the vendors

272
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
aren't doing a proper job of doing it

273
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,599
yet i'm here i'm not here to bash of any

274
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,879
vendors anybody that i mentioned

275
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,680
throughout the stock

276
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,520
isn't the part of the problem it's just

277
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,680
this is a very young and new

278
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
industry but the only thing is i've

279
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,720
realized is they're either

280
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,120
really good at focusing on being a good

281
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,719
at one aspect of this

282
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,039
asset management game or they offer a

283
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,399
large variety of

284
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,399
what i call unfinished products so

285
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,919
either they're really really good at

286
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,080
scanning the entire internet

287
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,360
but they don't give you good data they

288
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
don't have a good way of allowing you to

289
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
ingest that data or

290
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,080
look look at that data or the reporting

291
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
for it or they do a bunch of different

292
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,959
things like they scan

293
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,760
ports they pull certificates uh they

294
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,000
look for phones based on cves whatever

295
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
it is outdated software they do all this

296
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,040
stuff but

297
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,279
it's unfinished it's not fully done yet

298
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,680
and the ones that do actually do this

299
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,519
they're very very expensive they cost a

300
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,720
lot of money

301
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,399
one of the vendors that i know a friend

302
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,760
of mine works with

303
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,399
um i think they pay about twenty

304
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,680
thousand dollars a year and that's just

305
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,000
to get

306
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
access to an api just an api gives you

307
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
data for twenty thousand dollars

308
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,160
no no real reporting nothing like that

309
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
it's just very expensive

310
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
it's also hard to get real-time data so

311
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,279
by by that i mean the scan times are

312
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,480
either too long

313
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
it takes a few days to scan it and it's

314
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
not their fault again because there's a

315
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,120
lot of ipads

316
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
there's a lot of data out there to be

317
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,120
brought in and they also rely

318
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,519
they also rely on organizations knowing

319
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,399
what they own

320
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
so if an organization itself doesn't

321
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
know what main domains they own or what

322
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,120
sub domains they own what environments

323
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,000
they have

324
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
it makes it harder for them in a lot of

325
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,279
cases from what i hear is

326
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,279
the cso header security the cto whoever

327
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,040
is in charge goes into this vendor

328
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,160
meeting and says

329
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,839
i don't know what i have figured it out

330
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,519
that no that's not how it should be

331
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,920
there's gotta be that bridge that's uh

332
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
built between the two vendors and the

333
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,240
consumer

334
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
to make sure everything and everyone's

335
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
getting a full coverage of some sort or

336
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,720
getting close as we can

337
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
to providing full coverage so what do we

338
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,880
do now

339
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
well before i jump into the text i'm

340
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,600
going to go back before i answer this

341
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
question i wanted to actually

342
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
show you what it looks like from an

343
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,560
attacker's point of view and how you

344
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
approach a company and

345
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,720
i'm gonna walk through that process and

346
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
this is going to also touch on a limited

347
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,240
number of tools techniques and methods

348
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
that are out there

349
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
and i'm going to try and give you as

350
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
high level as i can without diving into

351
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
too much details

352
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,560
but i think it's something that we need

353
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,800
to talk about first

354
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,560
so the first thing is we're going to

355
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,959
look at the organization's structure

356
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,680
so again if i mention evil corp i'm not

357
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,440
calling any corporations evil

358
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,959
it's just the easiest name to come up

359
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
with but let's say evil corp owns

360
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,000
evilcorp.com

361
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
this is a large corporation they already

362
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,200
have

363
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
thousands of subdomains and internal

364
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
domains they could have

365
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,079
evil corp internal or it could have

366
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,440
evilcorp.net and some peoplecope.com for

367
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,839
their internal or corporate websites

368
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,040
evoke takes off

369
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,720
they have a ton of money investors are

370
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,079
happy they want to

371
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,680
take more of the market share so what do

372
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,920
they do they acquire evil startup

373
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
evil startup happens to be a big

374
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
infrastructure of its own they have a

375
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,800
lot of stuff on their own they have a

376
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
lot of domains i have a lot of sub

377
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,079
domains

378
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,720
and let's not even talk about the ascent

379
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,160
and the ip blocks that they may own

380
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,760
because that itself is another part of

381
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
this whole entire thing

382
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,399
that we have to take a look and we

383
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,079
repeat this cycle they buy more and more

384
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,279
and more and more

385
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,839
startups or other companies and that

386
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,720
scale

387
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,399
gets larger and larger and larger and

388
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,920
larger and it's very common in tech

389
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,200
companies especially

390
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,360
to see these uh mergers or acquisitions

391
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,519
to happen so we have to think about

392
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,320
how big this thing could become as an

393
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,720
example we can see that uber

394
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
has six acquisitions as far as i could

395
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,160
find this is

396
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
in the past 12 years the biggest and

397
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
most recent one was

398
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,360
their acquired post mates and postmates

399
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
i'm talking about experience here they

400
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,959
have a large infrastructure of their own

401
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,560
and i don't know what kareem is but

402
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
that's another entire organization of

403
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
its own to worry about and uber itself

404
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,279
is huge you have uber.com uber internals

405
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,560
and they have a bunch of different ip

406
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,800
addresses so that itself is huge

407
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
that's only with six acquisitions right

408
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,160
apple

409
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,519
i don't know what these two companies

410
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,000
are but apple's infrastructure alone i

411
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,560
think it's

412
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,440
somewhere between uh last i pulled a

413
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,959
number one and i think it comes down in

414
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,480
a few slides is

415
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,519
they have about 70 000

416
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,399
uh domains or you know sub domains that

417
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,079
has a keyword apple in it

418
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,480
and that's just apple.com alone and it

419
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
doesn't include

420
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,959
anything like um icloud or anything like

421
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,079
that either

422
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,440
so they have a hundred unfortunate

423
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
acquisitions their

424
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
as10 is giant it's one point something

425
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,880
million iphones

426
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,800
as far as i remember it's huge just

427
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
think about it like this is

428
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,480
giant company like apple itself and

429
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
they're not even the biggest one yet

430
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
there's also google google has 225

431
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,360
acquisitions

432
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
they have companies like uh point t and

433
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,560
app sheet and

434
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,000
more recent ones or more bigger ones

435
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
that i know of the waze looker

436
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
google itself you know google doc google

437
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
drive google sheets

438
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,639
uh scholar gmail all these micro apps i

439
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,000
have they're also huge they have a ton

440
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
of back ends

441
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,200
they probably have a huge infrastructure

442
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,680
also as well so you just can imagine

443
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,519
how much work that i've done to keep an

444
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,880
inventory to make sure things are not

445
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,839
being exposed

446
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,839
i'm not saying google apple these

447
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,440
companies actually know every

448
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,040
supplement or domain they own they may

449
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,720
or they may not but they have done the

450
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,240
right things the right approaches to

451
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
make sure things are gated enough

452
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,519
so the outside world doesn't see some of

453
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
these domains or sub-domains internal

454
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,160
services

455
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,240
or their corporate dev site whatever it

456
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
is they're not being visible

457
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,320
by the outside world so we're going to

458
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,399
talk about ocean and this is uh

459
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,680
i want to talk about acquisitions first

460
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,000
just to paint that picture of how big an

461
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,120
organization gets

462
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,880
and then how do i as a hacker can

463
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
identify all of these domains

464
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,399
if i'm lucky or if i have the right

465
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
tools so osan's a big part of it

466
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
now we're going to talk about a company

467
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,760
i like to work with a lot

468
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
i've hacked them a few times but they

469
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
also have a great bug binding program

470
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,160
great team

471
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
another great infrastructure it's a huge

472
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,360
infrastructure with a ton of

473
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,079
acquisitions

474
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
paypal so look at paypal obviously

475
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,760
they're on paypal.com

476
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,279
but what are some of the other domains

477
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,480
they own what are their acquisitions

478
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
what are their internal domains what are

479
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
their corporate domains

480
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,880
and what are some of the methods that we

481
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
can use easily using osen or some

482
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,399
tooling that are open source

483
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,279
and find more and more of these assets

484
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,079
well

485
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,680
let's take a look at the whois data for

486
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,920
paypal.com and this is really important

487
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,959
they have

488
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,560
the organization for the registrar for

489
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,160
the administrative contact

490
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,639
it's paypal inc and the email address

491
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,360
right here

492
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,079
our starting point is going to be

493
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,760
hostmaster paypal.com

494
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,279
that is great information to have and

495
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,880
now again i'm not saying that every time

496
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,519
we

497
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,959
go into a who is on a domain they're

498
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,959
going to have this data for us

499
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,680
but in a lot of cases some companies

500
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,199
have this email for the registrar and

501
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,000
again it could be

502
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
masked sometimes it can be protected but

503
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,600
in this case it's not

504
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
great what we're going to do is we're

505
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,959
going to find a

506
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,760
website like view dns info this one

507
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
costs a little bit of money i'm sure

508
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,800
there's better tools out there for it

509
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
um but this is one that i found that was

510
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,639
very very helpful so you go to this you

511
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
can do a reverse who is look up right

512
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,480
so cool we can do the registrant name

513
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,399
we're going to skip that one for now

514
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,240
too much work but just for the sake of

515
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,760
this conversation for the sake of this

516
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,959
presentation

517
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
i'm going to look at the email address

518
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,160
of it the registrar so i'm going to go

519
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,360
in there i'm going to type in host

520
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,240
master

521
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,360
at paypal.com we're going to push go and

522
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,320
it's going to come back with

523
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,000
3962 domains that this company has

524
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,720
collected

525
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
through the reverse who is lookup that

526
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,839
belongs to

527
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,199
paypal.com me as a bug money hunter

528
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,639
adversary whatever you want to call it

529
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,040
500 of these are free and accessible to

530
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,680
me

531
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,360
and i can just spend 50 bucks and get a

532
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,519
whole list of almost 4 000 domains that

533
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,040
belongs to this company

534
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,800
and that just starts at the start of my

535
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
day to start up my work

536
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
but you can see there is a accept venmo

537
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,399
which hints that they own venmo

538
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,160
they have some paypal stuff they have

539
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,440
some funding domains

540
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,920
you can go through their list and find a

541
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,519
lot of different information

542
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,279
personally for me the notable ones was

543
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,360
paypal.com duh that's a that's an

544
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
obvious one that's one that we know they

545
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,399
own they also

546
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
i also saw something like paypal dash

547
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,399
corp um paypal is actually very well

548
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,759
known for having

549
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
uh domains that either end in dash

550
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,160
paypal or start with paypal dash so it

551
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,199
could be

552
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,000
paypal dash marketing dot com paypal

553
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
dash corp as you can see on the screen

554
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
they're also on paypalcorp.com

555
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
braintree is one of their other

556
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,399
acquisitions or domains

557
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,639
they have bill me later and obviously

558
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,440
venmo being another big one

559
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
well we know that this is not the entire

560
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,759
list based on ranger alone

561
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,079
we can see there's bain braintree.com

562
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,519
braintree api

563
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,120
there's the tools and they also have the

564
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,720
gateway so there's a lot of domains that

565
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
probably have the keyword braintree

566
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,199
within it that we can find later on as

567
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,199
we do more research

568
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,440
and excuse me and they all probably have

569
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,120
a ton of subdomains too i know

570
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,920
paypal itself is huge but braintree

571
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
tools is an internal one that's huge

572
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,839
but this is just to paint a picture of

573
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,720
how big and how messy this could get

574
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,799
well lucky for us there is a certificate

575
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,720
transparency search transparency

576
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,000
which is an open framework for

577
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
monitoring ssl certificates so as soon

578
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,520
as a certificate is

579
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,160
issued to a domain it gets indexed

580
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,359
through one of these different

581
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,439
frameworks uh showdown does it

582
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,280
they allow you to do it through showdown

583
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,959
they're not specifically you know doing

584
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,559
this but should allows you to search for

585
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,200
it

586
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,400
uh census allows to do the same thing

587
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
for a limited number of queries but i

588
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,520
think you can pay them like a thousand

589
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,039
or something dollars a month i'm not

590
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,720
sure how much um but you can pay them

591
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,480
some money they'll give you access to it

592
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,280
store.ssh is free but they don't give

593
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,039
you a lot of data it's still use

594
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,880
useful to me personally as a hacker

595
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,640
search spotter and also google and

596
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,320
facebook have also gone

597
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,400
into the uh search transparency game so

598
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,600
you can use it actually with facebook

599
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,480
the cool thing is

600
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,280
on my phone i get push notifications of

601
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,640
some of these companies

602
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,320
that i have set up an alarm so it tells

603
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,960
me when a new certificate was identified

604
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,799
which is great because i can monitor it

605
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,640
now on my phone

606
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,840
well then when it comes down to looking

607
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,120
at a certificate there's a few things

608
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,720
that are very very important

609
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
at least for from my perspective and

610
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,000
things that i look at when it comes

611
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,799
down to identifying assets the first one

612
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,440
is

613
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,559
the subject organization this is the

614
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,039
organization that owns this certificate

615
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,039
based on the public key

616
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,880
the subject common name which represents

617
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
the server name that's being protected

618
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
by the certificate which is the host

619
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
name in a lot of cases

620
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,039
and also there's the subject

621
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,120
organizational unit this is the

622
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
department or the acquisition so in the

623
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,600
example right here as you can see the

624
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
organization itself is paypal

625
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,240
the organization unit is venmo

626
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,200
production

627
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,720
and this was issued to common name

628
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,360
ops.venmo.com and actually

629
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,640
if you pull this up and scroll all the

630
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
way down there's a ton of different

631
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,880
domains that's also listed

632
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,799
at the same time so but it's a good

633
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,000
information to have it helps you

634
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,440
identify and narrow down more of your

635
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,160
search

636
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
so i mentioned census one of my favorite

637
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,600
tools to use

638
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,160
it's nothing new but it allows you to

639
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
look based on the organization name so

640
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,640
all you do is part subject organization

641
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,880
you type in paypal inc brings you about

642
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,080
eight thousand domains

643
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,600
great or eight thousand assets and you

644
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
can see paypal inc

645
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,000
and braintree down there and also right

646
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,080
here qa.zoom or xom however you say that

647
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,520
that's a domain that i didn't know about

648
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,840
in my previous slides that also came up

649
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
great that's awesome we found more even

650
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,000
more assets that belongs to paypal

651
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
we can also do the organizational unit

652
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
so paypal itself is paypal production i

653
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
typed in paypal

654
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,320
it gave me secops paypal corp roca or

655
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,799
roca paypal.com

656
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,720
excuse me paypal inc.com and another

657
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,120
additional 3 000 domains some of it may

658
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,960
be the same as the previous one but it's

659
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
just to show there are different ways

660
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,799
you can actually identify these

661
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,720
just going through the certificates that

662
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,559
are on census itself

663
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
all right there's also the common name

664
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,720
the common name is a really

665
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,159
weird hit or miss one depending on the

666
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,600
organization but you can always look for

667
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,559
the common name you can type in

668
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,320
paypal.com paypal whatever you want to

669
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,039
look for

670
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,200
that's a great way to look for it not

671
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,280
really as helpful as the previous two

672
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,880
but it still gives you some data and it

673
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
shows you uh which ones have expired

674
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,159
which ones have been

675
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,799
um issued by digicert versus various

676
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,600
side and that

677
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,799
sort of stuff and the good thing about

678
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,039
this if you go back you can actually

679
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,600
do the tag or you can actually certain

680
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,000
sort them by the issuer which is

681
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
great because if you do if you see the

682
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,080
pattern

683
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,600
that is being used in a particular asset

684
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,120
it helps you narrow it down even more

685
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,159
so this is also the is one that i use

686
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,280
religiously

687
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
it actually has i think has a better

688
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,039
functionality for searching than most

689
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,520
other ones like census have which allows

690
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,280
you to actually search by any of these

691
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,559
fields through the certificate the

692
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,720
common name email address the unit name

693
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,240
organization name the dns name and

694
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,679
anything that you want to search for is

695
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,000
awesome it also gives you some more data

696
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,120
and the search can also

697
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,159
add output equals to json i believe

698
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,480
and that gives you a json blob of the

699
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,159
same exact data and it tells you when it

700
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,039
was logged

701
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,440
um it was the first time they've seen it

702
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,280
it was the last time you can see it

703
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,960
you can sort by it and all that good

704
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,799
stuff it's a great tool to use

705
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,559
but it also gives you some decent data

706
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,000
it doesn't give you the ip address i

707
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,280
think showdown is one of the only ones

708
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,400
that does it

709
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
now there's the tool that i use also

710
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
does a similar thing i just it's good to

711
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,039
have the ip address but it's not

712
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,080
required because

713
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,240
sometimes these are probably more than

714
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,559
likely internal like i hope these

715
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,120
qa sites on paypal itself uh content

716
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,679
transform.cuba.paypal.com more likely

717
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,400
internal

718
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,919
but you never know well there's also

719
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,280
recon tools you can use

720
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,799
amaz is one of the best ones i think

721
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,799
personally big shout outs to uh

722
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,520
obasp foundation and the team to support

723
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,240
this

724
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,559
adopting it also jeff foley and everyone

725
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,760
that works with him

726
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,440
done an amazing job i'm not here to sell

727
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,960
you on a mask but there's a bunch of

728
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,919
different tools you can use

729
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,559
subfinder i think the guys at this

730
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,919
project discover that's some really good

731
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,039
work

732
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,480
there's a ton of them you can use but a

733
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
mouse is a good one because

734
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
it actually allows you to uh do a bunch

735
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,400
of things there

736
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,760
so these are the three things that i

737
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
think are very very useful

738
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,880
when it comes down to using tooling like

739
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
a mass the first one is

740
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,960
intel which it gives you actually it

741
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,480
collects intel

742
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,159
and for enumeration so if you type in

743
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,840
collect intel

744
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,159
on organization paypal it looks for all

745
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,760
the domains it has in this you know in

746
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,200
its tool set with all the different

747
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
sources it has and then you can feed it

748
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,039
into a new later on

749
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,000
and it will perform enumeration on uh

750
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,400
these

751
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,159
different uh network mappings or

752
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,679
subdomains and domains that you have

753
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,159
found

754
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,960
through the intel and then next you can

755
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,480
uh visualize it so it actually gives you

756
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,080
a really nice looking graph

757
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
that shows you how things are connected

758
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
um there's also like

759
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,720
uh some dns stuff you can do with it um

760
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,480
to see if it resolves there is a tracker

761
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,840
there's a db thing and there's a bunch

762
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,720
of different other things you can do

763
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,840
with it but these are the top three

764
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,039
things that i found was really really

765
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,960
helpful using hamas

766
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
um the way they collect their data with

767
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
a pneum itself

768
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,840
it's through dns so they do some brute

769
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
forcing they do some reverse testing

770
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,640
they do some walking

771
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,080
there's zone transfer there's a bunch of

772
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,520
different things you can go on their

773
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,120
github page and actually see a lot of

774
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,400
this functionality

775
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,159
there's also the scraping they look at

776
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,240
ask.com but do

777
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,400
all these different search uh sites

778
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
doc.go dns dumpster and so on

779
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
they look at certificates we cover this

780
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,000
already but you can connect it to

781
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,480
facebook api google search spot or

782
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,279
sh they actually have a bunch of apis so

783
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,640
if you use some sort of an api you have

784
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,080
a key for

785
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,640
alien vault search spotter i mentioned

786
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,679
that earlier but

787
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,760
any of these different apis that a

788
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,279
vendor you may have a key to you can

789
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,799
feed it into this

790
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,559
through the conflict file i think and it

791
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,080
will pull from it and also it goes after

792
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,440
web archive so if you're not familiar

793
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,640
with wayback

794
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,679
or archive.org it actually goes to it

795
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,080
you can see the websites from 10 years

796
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,080
ago 2006 maybe even further like 20

797
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,880
years ago

798
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,640
and it collects data based on that as

799
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,240
well amazing stuff you can do with it it

800
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,559
just goes beyond just the regular

801
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,880
searching there is a lot of good

802
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,640
weaknesses and strengths for this

803
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,039
the biggest strength is it gathers a ton

804
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,799
of information it gives you domains it

805
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,480
looks like asn's they look for a bunch

806
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,440
of different things with different

807
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,159
methods

808
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,679
that include unit certificates brute

809
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,559
forcing apis there's multiple sources

810
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,000
uh they allow you to do a scripting

811
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
engine of its own we can write some

812
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
additional tooling and do other stuff

813
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,240
with it

814
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,679
but it has its downfall it has its

815
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,679
weaknesses you can't rely on a single

816
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
tool first of all as an organization

817
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,200
even as a hacker person i don't just

818
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,640
rely on a mass it's a great tool don't

819
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,840
get me wrong but

820
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,880
it's not 100 giving you 100 coverage

821
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
it's really slow against large

822
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,480
organizations just because it's not

823
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,200
because

824
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,720
it's not so much that they're slow and

825
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,559
they've built it to be slow but

826
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,000
the more data you have the more time

827
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,159
it's going to take for this to digest

828
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,200
run intel or and get that intel run

829
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,559
enumeration on it

830
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,159
and then finish that thing up you know

831
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,840
if you're doing 20 domains and each have

832
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,120
a thousand two thousand domains it's

833
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,720
going to take a very long time

834
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
it's not on umass but it's just one of

835
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
its weaknesses because it's a single

836
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,799
tool

837
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,279
especially if you rely on it and again

838
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,640
it might miss some of the newly

839
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,600
developed

840
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
or deployed apps or domains it may not

841
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,400
show up i did a benchmark on the domains

842
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,240
it could find based on the who is

843
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
and it was missing a ton and again it's

844
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,600
still a new tool i think it's only been

845
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,880
around for a few years

846
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,960
uh but it's getting there and also let's

847
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,640
be honest does every domain and every

848
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
subdomain have a certificate

849
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,600
i think it's becoming a best practice to

850
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,520
do it on default but i've seen a lot of

851
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,400
domains

852
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,480
a lot of sub domains at least that may

853
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,799
still not be protected by an ssl cert so

854
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,760
that's another one

855
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,159
it's not so much a mass weakness but

856
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,039
it's a part of the

857
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,240
part of the game especially when it

858
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,039
comes down to certificates

859
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,480
so this is at a high level what it looks

860
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
like when you want to enumerate

861
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,520
what i'm doing here is i'm just saying

862
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,960
hey i don't want you to get any intel i

863
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,919
have a domain that i want to

864
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,360
specifically go after

865
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,799
i want you to enumerate give me the

866
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,480
source an ip address

867
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,640
i will talk about the ipad just in a sec

868
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,240
but

869
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,559
this gives me where it's coming from so

870
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,400
i know obstacle venmo is coming from

871
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
search spotter

872
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
versus scope.qa.venmo it came from

873
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,279
hacker target for example

874
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,679
and this is just vanilla umass i don't

875
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,039
have any keys or any of my

876
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,200
data imported into it but it's just to

877
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,320
show it gives you this

878
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,559
beautiful data and it's very very

879
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,799
helpful when it comes down to it

880
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,840
but before i go further i want to

881
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,440
quickly do a recap i know i threw a lot

882
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,559
of stuff at you

883
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,880
um but the the the things that we talked

884
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,799
about if i can get it out

885
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,400
the first thing that we talked about was

886
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,679
the reverse lookup based on the

887
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,039
registrar's email

888
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,640
that's very helpful if you're lucky if

889
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,840
it's not protected you can get some

890
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,799
really good data

891
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,400
it's not that expensive you can also use

892
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,600
some tools i'm sure the one that i

893
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
showed isn't the only one

894
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,039
but that's a really good starting point

895
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,480
then you can pull sub domains based on

896
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,559
certificate transparency great

897
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,400
we can use tools like amass to gather

898
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,799
more info automate visualize etc

899
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,880
then we can use at what ip addresses are

900
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
coming out i mentioned

901
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,200
asn a bunch of times and the cool thing

902
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,880
about asn is if you have the block of

903
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,320
asn so if you see

904
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,799
that a mask comes back and says like hey

905
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,240
they own this

906
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,000
autonomous number that they have you

907
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,440
know this is this

908
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,799
asn number that they have

909
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,080
you can actually have a mass enumerate

910
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,039
more data and gather more intel on that

911
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,600
as number and you can find more domains

912
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,000
and subdomains and internal tools

913
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,919
based on that we'll talk about the asm

914
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,279
thing a little bit i actually

915
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,960
scanned the entire ipv4 that i really

916
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,399
want to talk about in a little bit

917
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,000
but that's a really good place to start

918
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and see what's being deployed every day

919
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,120
or every week

920
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,279
within those ip blocks that you own and

921
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,799
you just repeat this process and use

922
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,720
other tools

923
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,240
that's what we talked about so far there

924
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
are other options i just brought this up

925
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,840
scanning the ipv4 space which is one of

926
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,640
my

927
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,120
favorite things to talk about and this

928
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,480
is one of the things i've been obsessed

929
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,600
with for years

930
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,960
uh but before i jump into this actually

931
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,320
i want to say a big thank you to a few

932
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,039
people

933
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,480
uh one of them being zayat

934
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
going by zai is an amazing hacker he's

935
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600
been a good friend of mine

936
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
uh we experimented with this a little

937
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,640
bit

938
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,440
at a very small scale and then i met

939
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
tanner aka staticflow he actually helped

940
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
me with a lot of this data

941
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,799
we did a talk on scanning the entire

942
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,520
ipv4 and finding some bugs for fun

943
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
which led to hacking apple and a few

944
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
other big orgs you can check that out

945
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,480
later it's on youtube but

946
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,840
it's a very cool thing when it comes

947
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,600
down to scanning the ipv4

948
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
there's some pros and cons the pro is

949
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,960
you're in control how frequent you want

950
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
to scan data for you can control that

951
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,919
you want to do it every day

952
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,159
you want to scan it every week takes us

953
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,679
three hours so i can literally scan

954
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,679
three hours and then reset that scan

955
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,960
immediately to see if there's more

956
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,200
changes you can actually store and

957
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,240
access the data

958
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,159
um searching is very important and i

959
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,679
will talk about that a little bit

960
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,760
but you are in control of how you ingest

961
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,720
that data

962
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,080
and how you can access it and how you

963
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,919
can search through it and also what and

964
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,360
where you collect the data is really

965
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,240
important

966
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,840
a lot of organizations are scanning for

967
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,520
443 a lot of companies

968
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,880
focus on 443 but we also went as far as

969
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,559
scanning for eight four four three eight

970
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,000
thousand eight eight eight ten thousand

971
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,279
four four four three and some other

972
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:07,919
ports

973
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,440
and that even gave us more data because

974
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
some of these ips just had nothing on

975
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,480
him on 443

976
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,559
versus that 8443 there was a lot of good

977
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,559
data that we could come up with

978
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,279
the cons of it it's um it's messy i've

979
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,880
been saying everything is messy today

980
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,440
but

981
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
it requires a lot of engineering effort

982
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,320
it's time consuming it takes a lot of

983
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,760
time to get a good build going it took

984
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,399
us

985
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,399
over a year to figure out how to bring

986
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,240
down the cost and how to do it

987
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,399
uh fast we made a really big mistake at

988
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,520
some point and we sent the wrong

989
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,039
requests and we got a ton of nasty grams

990
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,399
and a ton of pissed off people that

991
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,600
didn't understand we're doing this for

992
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,480
research

993
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,520
we're not trying to hack into your

994
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,279
company we're just collecting data on

995
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,720
your certificates but

996
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,240
that could be a part of it and it's also

997
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
very expensive i mentioned

998
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,919
um and how you ingest that data could be

999
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,039
very hard if you don't have the right

1000
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,320
people to do it

1001
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,600
but also there's always this question

1002
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,039
that i ask even when you work with a

1003
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:53,600
vendor

1004
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
you have the data now what what are you

1005
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
specifically looking for how are you

1006
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,480
going to organize it

1007
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,200
how are you going to prioritize what

1008
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,559
you're going after

1009
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,720
but this is my personal use case for me

1010
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,760
personally it gave me

1011
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,240
more access and accurate data from the

1012
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,440
sources that i've

1013
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,919
you know that i've scanned the first

1014
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,120
thing was i can search for

1015
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,200
any keyword in any domain or any

1016
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,480
subdomain so i could just

1017
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,399
type in give me everything that has

1018
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,919
paypal in it

1019
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,520
and i could also say give me everything

1020
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,279
that has jenkins in it for example which

1021
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,720
i'll show those in a little bit

1022
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,159
i can also search based on the

1023
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,600
organization so i can say hey show me

1024
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
every certificate that's been issued by

1025
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,640
the organization paypal

1026
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,559
we should give me more domains in our

1027
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,720
case we scan daily almost in most cases

1028
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,080
and we choose what pores to scan

1029
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,440
sometimes we'll do eight four four three

1030
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,720
sometimes into four four three

1031
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
just because we wanna see what data we

1032
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,480
get i also like to do

1033
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,600
um i wanna access the ip i wanna know

1034
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,440
where did i get this certificate

1035
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,919
what ip does it belong to that's very

1036
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,440
important especially if it's a corporate

1037
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,279
domain or an internal asset

1038
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,559
then i know what it's out there we're

1039
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,600
not going to get into that a lot i just

1040
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,080
want to highlight why it's so important

1041
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,600
and obviously this also doesn't give me

1042
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
100 coverage

1043
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,039
but it's still the closest that's come

1044
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,559
because i can also

1045
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,039
look at the different results so if i

1046
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,960
scan today or this morning and i rescan

1047
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,000
again at nights

1048
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,440
and it takes me three hours to do each

1049
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,799
gain what are the differences between

1050
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,360
the two

1051
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,679
what change for paypal.com from this

1052
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,399
scan

1053
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,000
versus the other scan that i just did

1054
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,600
was it a new asset that came out what's

1055
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,200
the new domain that came up those are

1056
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,000
very very

1057
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
interesting to look at and i think that

1058
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,120
also gets missed

1059
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,799
by a lot of vendors because they're

1060
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,399
scanning every few days

1061
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,600
and i actually did a little bit of

1062
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,679
research on this last year we found some

1063
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,120
really cool stuff that were coming up on

1064
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,000
a tuesday

1065
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and by friday it was gone we could no

1066
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,200
longer see it it was no longer

1067
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,720
accessible it was either put behind some

1068
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
firewall or it was completely taken down

1069
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,559
so there's some cool stuff to think

1070
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,399
about especially when it comes to

1071
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,320
looking at what assets you own

1072
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,679
so one of the things that i was talking

1073
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,679
about is in this case i'm just looking

1074
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,039
for everything that's

1075
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,039
has the root domain so the braintree

1076
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,320
domain

1077
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,440
the root domain so whatever.com.net

1078
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,799
doesn't matter what it ends with but i

1079
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,240
want to make sure the domain itself has

1080
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,600
the word braintree

1081
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,840
so you can see in that tool it's one of

1082
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,519
the domains it's braintree

1083
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,240
payment uh braintree.tools also came up

1084
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,039
a few times

1085
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,080
but i'm just saying look at the

1086
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
subdomain data before the root domain

1087
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,720
and look at everything that has dev so

1088
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
it came up with developers

1089
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,600
dev dot branch dot api and blue front

1090
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,960
door qa dave

1091
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,679
something uh sorry blue front door qa

1092
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,399
dev

1093
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,000
dot brain tree whatever that domain is

1094
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
so it's giving me some really good data

1095
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,080
uh based on brilliant the keyword dev i

1096
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,840
could just switch out there for api i

1097
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,679
could switch out there for

1098
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,360
internal corp whatever that is so i have

1099
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
the freedom of searching however i want

1100
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,120
for whatever i want and it shows me the

1101
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,720
ip address

1102
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,039
next thing is looking at sending word

1103
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,960
paypal i want to see the apis

1104
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,880
is what is onpaypal.com that has the

1105
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,640
keyword api so there is

1106
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,720
course.api again think about the domains

1107
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,399
the text in there it's multiple domains

1108
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,600
not everything it's not showing the

1109
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
entire row for us in the screenshot but

1110
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,640
there are multiple domains in there in

1111
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,919
some cases

1112
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,360
but there's api dash s api dash a a

1113
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,120
api api-aa-3t

1114
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
and it shows me the iep i just where to

1115
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,720
collect it from

1116
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,000
i did a count i just want to kind of

1117
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,320
show how messy it is just for apples

1118
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,480
when you look at the rdn for apple right

1119
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,760
here it shows

1120
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,320
almost 60 000 domains of matched apple

1121
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,159
that's a lot of domains

1122
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,080
if you are a big organization like apple

1123
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,760
itself so that's another option of

1124
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
things you can do

1125
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,960
i'll talk a little bit but this is the

1126
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,720
last thing i want to show is jenkins i

1127
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,320
this is nothing to do with this talk but

1128
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,240
i want to show how scary it is that

1129
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,320
so many people's uh jenkins and simpsons

1130
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,000
are being shown publicly almost

1131
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,240
11 000 13 thousand or twelve thousand of

1132
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,440
them but

1133
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,760
i wanted to show you how messy it gets

1134
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,200
for some of these organizations

1135
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,120
but also having good data what i was

1136
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,240
demonstrating there

1137
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,760
you don't have to go to the extreme of

1138
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,399
scanning of ipv4 you can scan your isn

1139
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,159
you can ingest the data from somebody

1140
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,640
else but having the freedom of

1141
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,559
knowing what you're doing with this data

1142
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,080
how are you going to utilize this data

1143
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,120
what are you going to search for how are

1144
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,480
you going to search for this data

1145
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,760
these companies are going to give you a

1146
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,600
report but it doesn't necessarily mean

1147
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
it's complete or it's what your team is

1148
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,760
is in need of so you want to also know

1149
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,119
different ways and things that you can

1150
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,399
do with this data

1151
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,159
to find things that may be useful to you

1152
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,079
imagine if your dev sites are being

1153
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,000
publicly accessible if they're publicly

1154
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,359
accessible and that's not

1155
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,719
something you need that you don't want

1156
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,639
to be exposed that's a good way of

1157
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,639
realizing that it is being accessible by

1158
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,960
a third party or an outsider than your

1159
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,280
organization

1160
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,520
so some of the options of uh things you

1161
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,639
can do here

1162
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,000
is you can pay thousands of dollars a

1163
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,599
month and have a big org give a list of

1164
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,399
your assets

1165
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,760
there's a ton of those we talked about

1166
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,079
them again like i was mentioning earlier

1167
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,079
this is not the best way to ingest data

1168
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,440
or monitor them sometimes it's

1169
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,639
incomplete things change

1170
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,679
day by day um you can

1171
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,359
also work with those oils to get those

1172
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,199
open ports asset names

1173
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,800
they'll give you the possible cvs that

1174
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,639
your assets are vulnerable to

1175
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,480
but it's not a complete inventory of

1176
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,918
everything you have

1177
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,359
you can also go with the smaller ones

1178
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,960
intriguing asset notes are also really

1179
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,000
good alternatives

1180
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
big shout outs to jay crane and shabam

1181
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
shaw uh the two people that are behind

1182
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,560
these two companies

1183
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,920
but they have downfalls and this is

1184
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,880
nothing against them they're good

1185
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,240
friends of mine not here to bash on

1186
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,680
anybody but they're still in early

1187
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,400
stages

1188
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,440
they're still trying to figure out how

1189
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
to scale how to get really good data for

1190
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
each other customers

1191
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,680
and make sure it's complete their

1192
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
product isn't complete yet they're still

1193
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,200
controlling or they're still collecting

1194
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,720
data um

1195
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,920
it's getting there don't get me wrong

1196
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,880
but i just want to say there are

1197
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,000
different options you don't have to go

1198
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,760
with the big guys like risk iq

1199
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,920
and all the other ones that i mentioned

1200
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,200
there are some bigger startups that are

1201
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,560
coming out and doing this a little bit

1202
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,520
different

1203
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,680
and better than the uh older ways of

1204
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,200
doing this

1205
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
the options that i showed of using tools

1206
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,640
and chaining them together a mass

1207
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,119
up finder sublister find domain enter

1208
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,880
whatever tool name you have here

1209
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,240
like i mentioned you can also scan the

1210
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,400
ipv4 or scan asn

1211
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,920
depending on how large your organization

1212
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
is if you have the resources to do it

1213
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,240
good for you

1214
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
if not you got to find a way of getting

1215
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,839
better data

1216
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,520
or pay for the data that you have my

1217
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,880
favorite option personally and you know

1218
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
it's not going to be a

1219
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,160
talk by me if i don't mention bug bounty

1220
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,640
programs if you have a bug money program

1221
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,400
work with your hackers ask them how did

1222
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,680
you find this asset how did you know

1223
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,760
this thing was being hosted on port 3000

1224
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,880
and you found the

1225
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,800
ipa address but couldn't access it we

1226
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,079
can't access this domain but

1227
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,520
obviously you have found a way to access

1228
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
by ip what tools did you use was it a

1229
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,560
source that you

1230
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,119
specifically paid to get this collect

1231
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,440
data from your reports and analyze that

1232
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,880
so the hackers are willing to share with

1233
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,240
you and how they have done these

1234
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,320
understand it like take some time and

1235
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,920
work with your teams internally and see

1236
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,680
why this happened the way that why was

1237
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,240
this thing exposed why was this thing

1238
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,680
online what was this thing

1239
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,000
um who owns this domain or

1240
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
infrastructure whatever it is internally

1241
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
and really really analyze it and maybe

1242
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,520
host a recon challenge and if you don't

1243
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,119
believe me uh big shout outs to security

1244
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,960
trails actually they just uh partnered

1245
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,320
with hamas

1246
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,760
and they did a competition where

1247
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
they were actually paying or i think

1248
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,119
it's actually still going on for another

1249
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,000
few weeks

1250
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,640
they're paying hackers to submit data um

1251
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,359
to their

1252
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,720
platform which is a great way for them

1253
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,880
to collect data don't get me wrong but

1254
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
you can do that on your own too like hey

1255
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,079
give us a list of everything you

1256
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,599
can find on our company and want to know

1257
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,200
how you did it people may do it if you

1258
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
have a bug binding program if you have a

1259
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,800
uh the funding for it you have a bug

1260
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,240
binding program a successful program

1261
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
that you work with hackers on regularly

1262
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,960
this is also another way of doing it so

1263
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,320
i talked about all this stuff

1264
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,119
i want to talk about my solution i don't

1265
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,640
think i have a really

1266
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,480
you know one model fits all solution but

1267
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,520
i have some stuff that i want to talk

1268
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,320
about

1269
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,920
so far we know all the tools the vendors

1270
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,280
you can use the most efficient way of

1271
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,640
discovering assets

1272
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,400
everything's there we talked about that

1273
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,480
it's not a 100 coverage

1274
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,240
but it gives you a good starting point

1275
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,680
to discover and track some of your

1276
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,119
assets

1277
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,240
some of the things that you can do this

1278
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,000
is kind of a do's and don'ts is actually

1279
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,359
create a dedicated environment for

1280
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,040
testing sites and make sure it's always

1281
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,839
protected so if you're doing

1282
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,359
dev.site.com make sure no one can access

1283
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,640
that because if they can't access it you

1284
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,680
don't have to worry about what's out

1285
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,320
there

1286
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,000
because no one can actually see it it's

1287
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,520
good to have the list so no you want to

1288
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,560
have a list of those

1289
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,160
you might want to create a process to

1290
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,000
deploy and track those assets internally

1291
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,359
but if it's protected you don't have to

1292
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,640
worry about somebody owning that

1293
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,599
environment

1294
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,720
and getting in and also find a way of

1295
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,520
a process where you can actually um take

1296
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,800
these assets down i

1297
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
mentioned earlier on in the in my slides

1298
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,160
that you know

1299
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,800
once you have these assets coming down

1300
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,240
what happens to the dns record is it

1301
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,520
just still pointing to the thing that i

1302
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
was pointing to a month ago since the

1303
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
box is down

1304
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,839
or the other way if you took down the

1305
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,760
dns record is the ips is still up and

1306
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,400
accessible

1307
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,320
you want to think about those things

1308
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,160
again make sure you keep track make sure

1309
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,359
you have some way of collecting data

1310
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,480
from your teams

1311
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,160
and also help vendors it doesn't help

1312
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,760
when you go to a vendor and say well

1313
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,839
i don't know what i own figure it out

1314
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,520
they're going to figure it out but

1315
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,560
at the end of the day you know your

1316
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,720
infrastructure better your engineers

1317
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,800
know what to look for what they own so

1318
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,359
work with them as well and that's

1319
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,640
obviously the opposite is almost the

1320
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,160
same thing but the opposite don't expose

1321
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,200
your assets

1322
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,880
uh don't just take down your assets by

1323
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
deleting it delaying the record or just

1324
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,240
deleting the box and saying you'll be

1325
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,440
fine

1326
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,960
don't just rely on vendors for

1327
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,480
everything really find a way how you're

1328
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,760
going to take down that data

1329
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,880
how you're going to collect data from

1330
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,640
them and what are you going to do next

1331
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,760
with that data that you're

1332
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,280
getting from the vendors have a really

1333
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,599
good process of

1334
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,240
i actually have a process of going

1335
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,359
through that data

1336
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,599
and how you want to uh manage it and

1337
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,920
what are the things that you look for

1338
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,359
and don't wait until later if you're on

1339
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,280
a security team at a startup

1340
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,040
start thinking ahead your company's

1341
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,119
going to even grow and grow more

1342
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,560
every year so don't wait three years

1343
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,320
from today to do this start thinking

1344
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,760
about how am i going to start tracking

1345
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,200
all these things

1346
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,520
so my thoughts on this again as i've

1347
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,960
mentioned

1348
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,119
there is this is still a very immature

1349
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,320
and young

1350
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,160
it's still growing we're getting there

1351
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,640
it's it's not 100 there but a lot of

1352
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,680
companies are doing some really good

1353
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,640
research

1354
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,920
uh again improve and create your

1355
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,760
processes really work with your teams

1356
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,880
you really want to i want to

1357
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,000
make sure that there's something that

1358
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,160
you guys take away if you folks take

1359
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,920
away from this talk is to really work

1360
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,040
with your teams

1361
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,680
to create a process to track all these

1362
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,960
different data you work with your

1363
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,000
vendors

1364
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,599
you create your own tools on top of

1365
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,359
these different vendors you work with it

1366
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,040
doesn't hurt to run amass if you really

1367
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,319
know how to use these tools doesn't have

1368
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,280
to be a mass

1369
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,359
but running a tool here and there to see

1370
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,480
what kind of data you have work with

1371
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,920
your red teams your blue team to see if

1372
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,800
they can do it

1373
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,640
and obviously really analyze your data

1374
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,839
that you get from your bug binary

1375
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:20,720
program

1376
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,480
and other security teams if you think

1377
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,079
i've missed anything so far i would love

1378
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,599
to hear your thoughts i'll be in the

1379
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,960
chat obviously but

1380
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,400
i also would love to hear from you so if

1381
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,480
you want to tweet at me and let me know

1382
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,280
i would really appreciate it um again

1383
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,000
this is

1384
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,160
something very very new i think the

1385
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,880
asset management

1386
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,640
attack surface management industry is

1387
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,720
going to be the next big thing

1388
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,200
but it's also up to us to make sure we

1389
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,400
work with the entire industry whether

1390
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,599
it's with your hackers whether you're

1391
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,960
working with your vendor

1392
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,839
and also doing some additional research

1393
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,920
and work together really to get this

1394
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,319
entire thing to push forward other than

1395
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,520
that i just want to thank you again for
