1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,199
greetings everyone i will be

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,440
covering a variety of interdisciplinary

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,839
areas from the ics security point of

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,960
view

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,120
in order for us to be able to answer to

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,080
this question

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,920
do we really want to live in the

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
cyberpunk world

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,560
uh during the talk i will be sharing

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,240
only the actual stuff and their

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,400
potential implications in terms of the

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,160
ics cyber security

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,119
uh maybe you know them all but mostly we

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,119
deal with the details and lack of seeing

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,479
the bigger picture

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,399
when we're dealing with the ics security

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,880
also i want to point out that these are

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,800
my own thoughts and my own way of

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,239
interpretation

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,800
of the advancements in technology and

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
their correlation

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,039
with my own experiences obviously yours

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,760
might be

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
different than mine but i want to raise

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,800
an awareness about these subjects

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,120
and in my opinion we should not consider

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,559
these subjects separately

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,879
or different areas than the ics world

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,680
uh before i dive in further though allow

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,959
me to introduce myself

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,200
my name is max but you can simply call

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,320
me merch can click

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,640
because i have been known to being able

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,000
to collect from the early ages

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,880
of my life i'm a computer engineer with

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
the master's degree in cyber security

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
i promise i primarily focus on the cyber

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,320
physical systems as well as the wider

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,560
networks and the isp implementations and

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,240
their security as well

41
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,200
i work as an ics penetration tester in

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,360
the barricade cyber security

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
where i get to do a lot of penetration

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,720
testing to

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,040
a rich variety of cyber physical systems

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,280
now let's quickly define what cyberpunk

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
is so that we are on the same page when

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,600
it comes to answering our title question

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,000
the term cyberpunk was originated back

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
in the 80s as a sci-fi dystopia where

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,119
the society is dominated by computer

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,520
technology and big corporations

53
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,159
where everything was interconnected in

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,840
some way or another

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
in short we can describe it as the era

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,840
of high tech load life

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,119
and in the essence of it we can simply

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,800
call it like the hacker culture

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
back in the 80s ics operation and

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,440
management was considered as an

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,599
extremely sophisticated and serious area

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,160
of work

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,480
which is true even today scada was in

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
place and less people had to do the

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,599
dirty work on the field

66
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,080
what we basically do on the ics is that

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
we process the inputs

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,000
and take actions accordingly it was

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
mostly done by hand

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,319
from the control center but hence the

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,280
term control

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,760
system implies right things were less

73
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,800
digital back then

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
there were nixie tubes lots of switches

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,160
and indicator lights

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,280
etc nearly all of these components were

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,599
hardwired right so it was quite hard to

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
maintain and troubleshoot in case of an

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,640
incident

80
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,319
and also because of that the cyber

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
security was not big of a concern other

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
than the

83
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,480
physical violations also there weren't

84
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
many rf applications back then

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
even though there were some examples and

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,080
rf devices were

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,040
not big of a security concern because of

88
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,200
acquiring an rf equipment was not

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
feasible in terms of size

90
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,720
and the cost and also in 1979 modbus

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,040
was introduced by modicom and brought a

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,680
new way of communicating with rot

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,720
devices and most of these principles of

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,519
ics

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,720
still applies today

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,680
so by looking from the 80s to now maybe

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
we are living in the cyberpunk world

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,640
and there is only one way to find out so

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,280
i would

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,360
kindly ask you to put on your power

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
gloves and let's hack time

102
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,239
all right 1980s to today

103
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,360
the basic principle for the ics did not

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,720
change a lot but

105
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
the way of implementing it really

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,439
changed over time

107
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,560
even though it changed in drastic ways

108
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,959
we still have the modbus family uh it's

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,840
mostly modbus tcp but we get to see it

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,040
very often on the ics realm and isis

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,799
security still relies on

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
the physical security and security

113
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,400
throughout security approach

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,720
is a must when it comes to the ics

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
security

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,680
and there is a rapid transition to the

117
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
wireless we are

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,918
planning to convert most of our field

119
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,639
devices

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,160
into a wireless medium and we all know

121
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
what wireless means

122
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,960
it's accessible to anyone we now have

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,520
the

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,360
iiot as well which we will cover soon

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
and we have some models that we

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
implemented

127
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
such as purdue and but for

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
now we get to see a newer approach

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
for ics implementation and it's more

130
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
cloud-oriented architecture

131
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,160
we are planning to carry out our

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
operations and our

133
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,360
data to the cloud as well as any other

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960
systems and also now the ics world

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,000
relies on the

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
geographical information systems where

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
we can use the gps

138
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
and other technologies that are out

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
there

140
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,759
so let's start with the real life

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
example for the ics world

142
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,039
for those who are not familiar with it i

143
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,039
will be giving some examples and some

144
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,120
possible attack vectors

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
in terms of ics security

146
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
so let's take a look for the gas

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
distribution systems uh

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,039
we try to distribute the gas

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,520
uh by going through different steps

150
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
where we tend to reduce the pressure up

151
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,039
to a point where we can use

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,160
in our household uh the gas is being

153
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,479
distributed in really high pressures for

154
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,160
to achieve high volumes

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
and we have to reduce it down to a point

156
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
where we can use it which is around one

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,199
to twenty for

158
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,560
21 millibar and it starts its journey

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
with the 60 to 75 bars atmospheric

160
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,919
pressure

161
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,600
as as long as we keep uh reducing that

162
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,479
pressure

163
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,440
the natural gas has this unique property

164
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,160
of

165
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,039
uh being cooled down about a half a

166
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,039
centigrade degree celsius

167
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,120
for every atmospheric pressure you

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,919
reduce it to

169
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,440
we use gas chromatography uh that's for

170
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,199
to analyze the compounds within the

171
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
natural gas

172
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,759
it's mostly done in on real time uh

173
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,360
obviously the natural gas does not

174
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,280
consist of only single compound it's a

175
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
mixture of compounds we have to measure

176
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,479
it and most of the

177
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,240
uh the distribution companies are being

178
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,720
you know

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,840
charged based on those values

180
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,479
and we use flow computers sensors and

181
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,319
all that kind of crazy stuff to achieve

182
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,759
that but also

183
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
comes with the price and we have to use

184
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,319
the gas analyzers which

185
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,720
has to be on some kind of embedded

186
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,000
operating system

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
but in my experience i have mostly seen

188
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
them using windows

189
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,080
ce also another interesting feature of

190
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,840
the natural gas it

191
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,960
that is that not contain any odor

192
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,440
so you can't really detect by smelling

193
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,199
the natural gas i know that

194
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,160
you know what it smells like but that's

195
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,560
not

196
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
by its default we have to use some kind

197
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,479
of alteration

198
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,880
to achieve that and we use some special

199
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,440
liquid that is called the thd

200
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,720
uh for to order that natural gas

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,000
that is being transmitted but the thd

202
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,599
is so potent that only one drop of it

203
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
can authorize about 2400

204
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,800
meter cubes of gas uh which smells

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,199
awful already so in order to authorize

206
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,319
the natural gas

207
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,879
we obviously use the scada system and we

208
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,360
have the plc or rgu

209
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,680
which is connected using the wireless

210
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,479
modem

211
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,080
it claims that we should cover it in a

212
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,759
safe area but i

213
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
don't see the definition for the safe as

214
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,599
for the example of the florida water

215
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,720
supply attack

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,960
where the hackers were able to you know

217
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
manipulate the system

218
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
of the mixture of the lye on to the

219
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,879
water supply

220
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,080
and changing the value to 100 to

221
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,680
11 000 parts per million and the same

222
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
principle

223
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,759
can be used to manipulate or use as an

224
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
attack vector

225
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
for the authorization technologies as

226
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
well

227
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,879
so we as you can see from the you know

228
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,120
data sheets we use the

229
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
old hardware they are connected either

230
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
using the serial port

231
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,080
or some kind of modem and most of them

232
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,399
are

233
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,519
still operating from the modbus protocol

234
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,839
so all in all we mostly use the same

235
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,920
principles of hacking when it comes to

236
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
conducting a pen test on the critical

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
infrastructure

238
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
there are also some hardware related

239
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
techniques but are mostly overlooked

240
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,000
security incidents in the past has shown

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
us that the air gap approach of ours is

242
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,640
not

243
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,279
invulnerable and in my opinion it won't

244
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,080
be

245
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,560
sufficient in the future as well it has

246
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,920
been known that there are countless

247
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,279
possibilities to try

248
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,279
if someone with malicious intent ever

249
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,760
finds a way into the ot network

250
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,839
uh triggering a denial of service on a

251
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,440
field device is the least that can be

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,560
done

253
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
there were incidents on the power

254
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
distribution lines where

255
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,519
attackers have access to the

256
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,839
infrastructure from a remote location

257
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
where they made their way up to the ot

258
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
network and in the end

259
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
they successfully manipulated the

260
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
syncrophasers

261
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
there are also some sneaky methods for

262
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,279
compromising the ot network and air

263
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,320
gapness

264
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
a single board computer with built-in

265
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
mobile data implementations can be

266
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
really hard to detect

267
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,560
uh especially if you have the network

268
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,800
infrastructure is not well established

269
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,040
in

270
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,160
a security oriented fashion i have seen

271
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
folks who are in charge of dlt network

272
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,720
made some ignorant claims about that the

273
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
specific vulnerability won't cause any

274
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,800
security problems to their network

275
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,880
uh they make these claims based on the

276
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,440
trust of the air gap implementation

277
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,079
but as soon as they see a demo about the

278
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,279
possible implant

279
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,160
implications of the spc implant which i

280
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,519
randomly place it

281
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,519
on an unexpected field switch and ask

282
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,279
them to pinpoint it by

283
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,560
physically or off of the network traffic

284
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,279
you get to see the fear in their eyes

285
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,079
and how

286
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,000
how hard it can be to detect such

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
devices if you don't have a

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,680
fully mature ot network on top of that

289
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,760
reminding them about the past incidents

290
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
of insider attacks

291
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
and the you know the new supply chain

292
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
attacks they

293
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,399
then tend to grasp the idea of why that

294
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,320
ms something something vulnerability

295
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,600
needs to be addressed

296
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,959
regardless of the internet connectivity

297
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,720
uh so most common hardware related

298
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
techniques is to

299
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
mess with the firmware and the serial

300
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,160
communications on the embedded device

301
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,360
itself

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,760
we fire up our logic analyzers bus

303
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
pirates and many other fancy gadgets to

304
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,959
have a foothold on the device itself

305
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,320
when you have an access to

306
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,200
devices such as modbus gateways or the

307
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,560
media converters

308
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
which are also overlooked and are

309
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,480
considered crucial most of the times

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,000
what do we get to see most cw259

311
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,360
hard-coded passwords

312
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
on top of that rfcoms are causing a

313
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
greater risk than ever before

314
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
thanks to our sdrs it is possible to

315
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
interact with rfcoms

316
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
nearly every portion of the spectrum

317
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,519
depending on your hardware obviously

318
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,760
all you have to do is to set up your sdr

319
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
to the desired configuration

320
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
so that you don't need to buy out of the

321
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,120
box radio which is designed to work

322
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,720
under a specific band

323
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
by the whole help of these devices such

324
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,839
as heck rf

325
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,920
not only we can receive signals but also

326
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,519
we can make transmissions too

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,760
uh therefore attacks such as gps

328
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,279
spoofing are out there for

329
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,240
nearly a decade now and the rf attacks

330
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,480
can cause very devastating outcomes

331
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,800
especially for maritime operational

332
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,760
technologies and such

333
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,680
now let's take a look for the emerging

334
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,440
technologies so that we can see these

335
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
advancements and there are similarities

336
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,240
with the ics security

337
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
tendency to make everything smart is out

338
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
of control there is iot and iiot where

339
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,760
an ordinary raspberry pi is being

340
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,279
used in heavy-duty industrial

341
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,160
applications we use cheap esp devices to

342
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,360
monitor and

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
monitor our hydrophonic food forms or

344
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
control our buildings and cities

345
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
and i understand that being able to grow

346
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,680
our food without using any soil and

347
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,519
stacking them up like server racks is

348
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,000
tempting

349
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,240
and cool but i have doubts about their

350
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,880
security implementations too

351
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
i said that there aren't many security

352
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,519
percussions in place on those systems

353
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,360
even though they are part of the

354
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
critical infrastructure as far as i know

355
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,680
we have to be able to keep away the

356
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,279
attackers from manipulating

357
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,680
the nutrition injection systems by using

358
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,200
the similar techniques

359
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,120
as we have seen in the florida water

360
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,680
supply attack

361
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
also people are now carrying a local

362
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
area network of interconnected devices

363
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,360
right on their bodies

364
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,600
as a result of that internet of medical

365
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,040
and internet of health things have

366
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,000
emerged

367
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
if you were to look for frequency

368
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
allocation for those medical devices and

369
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,519
their telemetry bands

370
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,360
it is clear that they are well within

371
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,079
our reach with our sdrs

372
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,639
ivmds are not something new but they are

373
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,600
also being

374
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,160
rf enabled in vast amounts uh doctors

375
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,240
now can monitor your health data

376
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,880
like an ics operator they can upgrade

377
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,959
your ibm these firmware or its

378
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,160
parameters remotely

379
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,720
insulin pumps are widely used today and

380
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
if you look at the functional diagram

381
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,120
we have rf links temperature sensors and

382
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,639
motor controllers

383
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,120
it's like a mini ics of its own in some

384
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
sense but they are designed

385
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,399
not to have an air gap to function

386
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,600
and there are the implantable rfid

387
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,240
devices

388
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,000
despite the fact that many people

389
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,760
purchase and implant them by their own

390
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
will

391
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,360
i don't see why not that we will be

392
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
asked to have such devices on us if we

393
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,000
ever decided to use the airports where

394
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
rfid tunnels can check our health and

395
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,760
vaccination status

396
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,040
in an automated fashion

397
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,079
so by putting all these together remote

398
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,079
healthcare became more effective we can

399
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,880
simply call it the backroom healthcare

400
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,040
i don't see any obstacles where

401
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,160
adversaries are

402
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
analyzed and make real-life correlations

403
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
with the victims historical heart rate

404
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,120
data

405
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,639
so that they can design a better

406
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,160
spearfishing attacks

407
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,040
even a read-only data can be used to

408
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,680
leverage those types of attacks

409
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,800
another cool topic uh bci the brain

410
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,320
computer interfaces

411
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
like the human machine interfaces are

412
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,360
here too

413
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,959
uh they are basically reading your brain

414
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,639
activity and decoding them

415
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,880
to the signals to operate a desired

416
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,480
external device

417
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
and there's this non-invasive vcrs are

418
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,040
like putting on a head and you can take

419
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
it off and desired but

420
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,079
on the other hand the invasive

421
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,920
applications of the bci

422
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,160
needs electrode implantation directly

423
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,440
into the cortex

424
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,959
wouldn't that be great to operate the

425
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,959
scada systems without even moving a

426
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,279
muscle

427
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,880
so one example of the bci technology is

428
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,279
the

429
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,320
open source project called the openvci

430
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
and so this technology can be easily

431
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
mapped or programmed in a way

432
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,279
to allow us to handle certain parts of

433
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,079
the ics

434
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,360
operations and also there are already

435
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
some products out there

436
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
where their primary concern is not the

437
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,800
health rather to take us one step closer

438
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,000
to the cyberpunk world

439
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
so just to be clear these technologies

440
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,000
are promising for sure and i don't want

441
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
to sound like i'm against them but

442
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,199
potential vulnerabilities

443
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,800
that might affect these kind of

444
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,880
technologies and their implications are

445
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,079
kind of scary

446
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,560
all i'm trying to explain is that ics

447
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,800
operators or people who are in charge of

448
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,399
critical operations

449
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,560
may have these kind of interconnected

450
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,759
devices on them

451
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,800
therefore their ivmds could be used as a

452
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,959
pivot point to compromise our critical

453
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,560
infrastructure

454
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,040
and when we are going to put this

455
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,120
possibility of our security policy

456
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,000
equations

457
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
i don't know but if so let's say we

458
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,880
decided to do that what are we going to

459
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,279
do

460
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,079
ask for an api key to their ibm d so

461
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,759
that we can include them in our pen

462
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,279
testing scope

463
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,360
anyway moving on simplest form of attack

464
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,800
against such devices

465
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,199
is battery drain attacks uh you can

466
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,360
consider them as denial of service but

467
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
for ibm these

468
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
and all you have to do is simply trigger

469
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,519
the rf

470
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,839
module over and over again as if you

471
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,360
were about to communicate with them

472
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,920
a case study and well detailed post was

473
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,279
published recently

474
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,959
it's a great example for capturing and

475
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,120
decoding an rf signal that is being

476
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,240
transmitted

477
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,199
off of an ingested capsule that is being

478
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,160
used to measure

479
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,799
and record the ph levels inside the body

480
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,599
utilization of autonomous vehicles are

481
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
also on the rise for both public and

482
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:14,880
industrial use

483
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,439
and certain in some certain industrial

484
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
areas they are being used as a part of

485
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,720
the production line

486
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,520
therefore in my opinion avs should also

487
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,079
be included in the overall evaluation of

488
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,959
those processes

489
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,039
not so long ago we have witnessed a

490
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,440
drone attack targeting the saudi aramco

491
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
soil processing facilities

492
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
this may be categorized as a matter of

493
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,840
national security and not the

494
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,559
responsibility of the ics governors but

495
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,240
in the same time custom-built drones

496
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,000
with autonomous flight capabilities

497
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,799
can be used to attack our facilities and

498
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,799
drone jammers won't be able to intercept

499
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,760
them

500
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,080
even if we decide to place them in our

501
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,000
infrastructure as it was like an

502
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
ot equipment yet i can't see any

503
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,280
possible

504
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,039
prevention mechanism and that we can use

505
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
other than the offensive approaches

506
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,400
which is whole another

507
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,280
discussion to make

508
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
i think we won't be able to hide behind

509
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
the air gaps false sense of security

510
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,720
anymore

511
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
because we are transitioning into a

512
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,799
phase where our most critical equipments

513
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,640
are being hyper connected more and more

514
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,080
every single day

515
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,919
there are millions of people with

516
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,080
medical implantations and one of those

517
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,520
people might be working in your

518
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
infrastructure without even you knowing

519
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,640
it

520
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,360
his or her or her device might have some

521
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,039
vulnerabilities and if you get to think

522
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,160
about that

523
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
these devices have all sorts of

524
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,600
reprogrammable components like

525
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,000
microcontrollers and fpgas right so even

526
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,799
today we

527
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,720
see a lot of windows xp's and windows

528
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,400
7's with our

529
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,039
uh with very old vulnerabilities on them

530
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,880
inside our ics networks

531
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,720
and companies who are not willing to

532
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,799
reinvest millions of dollars

533
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,720
just to erratic eradicate those

534
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,559
potential security flaws

535
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,000
and keep on running the process and

536
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,640
risk acceptance right so there is no way

537
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
of knowing that your

538
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,280
operator might being used as a gateway

539
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,600
to

540
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,160
exploit those systems as well and

541
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,960
attackers

542
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,520
won't have to find a zero day to further

543
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,640
penetrate into

544
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
dot infrastructure because they are

545
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,240
vulnerable already

546
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,600
let's look at this issue from uh

547
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,840
different perspective what if that

548
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,640
vulnerability of ibm d device is simply

549
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,679
unupgradable and you know the hardware

550
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,360
is not sufficient enough to

551
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,320
have that new firmware and the health

552
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,039
insurance won't pay for the new surgery

553
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,160
and that operator of ours might accept

554
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,880
the risk personally but wouldn't that

555
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
decision will also put rics into risk as

556
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,640
well

557
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,559
so that's a question that we need to

558
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,640
consider and also

559
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
i'm almost certain that we will get to

560
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,880
see ransomware issues on medical

561
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,000
implants

562
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,480
uh the cloud infrastructures that

563
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
operators of ours

564
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,679
might have been hospitalized and

565
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,440
desperately waiting for ransom to be

566
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,919
paid so that he can get his insulin pump

567
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,880
working again and as i mentioned earlier

568
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,320
i think

569
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
there are huge similarities between the

570
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
ot and these technologies that i have

571
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,039
been explaining

572
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,000
and these technologies are not designed

573
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,320
in a security oriented fashion

574
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,200
my point is that we should and must

575
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,520
actually put our security considerations

576
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,760
at

577
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,240
top priority if we are going to

578
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
interconnect everything

579
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,400
so basically we simply cannot deny these

580
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,360
facts

581
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,080
are here one last concern that i have is

582
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,000
how are we going to train more cyber

583
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,320
security experts who are capable of

584
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,159
tackling these challenges you know

585
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,200
ics security is one of those areas where

586
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,159
there is lack of labor environment it's

587
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,880
not as easy to train qualified workforce

588
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,039
for the ics as it is in id pen testing

589
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,039
there are definitely some great examples

590
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,880
of ics exercise

591
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,200
test beds but you have to be in the

592
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
vicinity of those environments to be

593
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
able to work with them

594
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,280
you know most of the time and if you get

595
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,039
to think about many of us

596
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,960
dragged into the cyber security field

597
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,080
mainly as a result of our curiosity

598
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,840
you know we break things and to make

599
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,280
things and more

600
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,880
young people will feel the same

601
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,039
curiosity too

602
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,960
when we made a mistake back then the

603
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,159
worst case scenario

604
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,600
was having a blue screen of that vsod

605
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,080
but that potential hacker of ours might

606
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,039
get tempted

607
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,840
by neighbor's son's ivmd and

608
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,360
unintentionally caused

609
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,120
irreversible problems

610
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,000
okay now for the last part the future i

611
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,400
will

612
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,679
briefly talk about what we might end up

613
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,720
seeing

614
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,559
when you put all these technologies

615
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,320
together and you know hyper connect

616
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,880
everything

617
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,400
together and the beginning would be the

618
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,280
transhumanism or human 2.0

619
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
this is where most of the sci-fi

620
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,559
dystopias are born

621
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,440
augmentations are like upgrades for the

622
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,080
humans

623
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
so you know you can consider them like

624
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,480
what steroids are today

625
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
not only the people with medical needs

626
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,080
will buy them but

627
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
people are expected to use augmentations

628
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
just to be more superior

629
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,799
by using the technologies that are

630
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,039
already here and trying to guess which

631
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,400
direction they're headed

632
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,640
i don't see why not people and their

633
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
augmentations could be

634
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
manipulated in a way that they have not

635
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,679
intended themselves

636
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,440
it could be as simple as pushing a

637
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
button in the skater room which they

638
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,000
shouldn't

639
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,720
or turning off a nuclear power plant

640
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,159
which they are in charge of

641
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,880
and you know what they say hackers gonna

642
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,760
hack and

643
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,039
cyberpunk world if it ever happens in my

644
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,280
opinion which is already happening

645
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,080
will be a new area for the cyber

646
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,880
criminals

647
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,919
thus we need to be prepared and we need

648
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:02,960
to

649
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,679
start working way our way up to

650
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,480
executing security measures for those

651
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,280
subjects

652
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,600
to come we definitely are not in those

653
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,720
good old days

654
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
where there were no mass data collection

655
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,039
was in place

656
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,200
but the last amount of data that is

657
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,559
being collected now

658
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,240
also includes a very personal and

659
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,840
real-time details about us

660
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,400
and in my opinion neglecting the

661
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
possibility of these data could

662
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,480
ultimately affect our way of doing

663
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,240
things in terms of

664
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,760
ics cyber security i hope

665
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,559
i'm not hacking too much time uh this

666
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,880
talk wasn't about you know

667
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
creating a debate about these subjects

668
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,320
but just sharing

669
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,559
my thoughts and i'm simply unkindly

670
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
asking you to open your eyes

671
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
because those stuff are not far away

672
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,400
from now

673
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
most of them are here already so

674
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,919
be prepared and we need to get ready for

675
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,679
them

676
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,679
obviously there will be some denial

677
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,240
phase it's understandable but it's the

678
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,960
first step

679
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,240
towards the acceptance

680
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,679
you needed the references and i would

681
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,520
like to thank you all for your time and

682
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,799
attention

683
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,559
